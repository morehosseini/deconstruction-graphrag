In October 2022, Australia’s\nEnvironment Ministers committed to accelerate the transition to a circular economy by 2030.\nInternational studies suggest that a more circular economy supports higher economic growth and productivity,\nincluding by increasing materials productivity (how much output is produced per unit of raw input). Australia\ncurrently has the fourth lowest rate of materials productivity in the OECD. We generate US$1.20 of economic\noutput for every kg of materials consumed, which is under half the OECD benchmark of US$2.50.\nThe Minister for the Environment and Water’s Circular Economy Advisory Group has also identified\ncommercial, regulatory, information and other barriers to achieving a more circular economy, and\nopportunities for Australia to improve economic and environmental outcomes through greater materials\nproductivity and efficiency.\nHowever, there is currently limited analysis of these matters, including the relative importance of these\nopportunities and how they should be measured and realised.\nScope\nIn this inquiry, the Productivity Commission is to investigate and report on:\n• The potential scope to lift Australia’s materials productivity and efficiency, and the best metrics to measure\nthis opportunity and improvements made.\n• Priority circular economy opportunities for Australia, including identification of the sectors, products or\nsupply chain segments:\n– Where Australia has the greatest potential to improve materials productivity/efficiency in ways that can\nstrengthen economic outcomes, such as productivity, economic growth, economic diversity and capability\n– Where other countries have made the greatest progress towards circularity, and the risks and\nopportunities associated with these developments in international markets for Australia\n– Where cost-efficient emissions reduction could be achieved by improving materials productivity and\nreducing waste.\n• Barriers to enhanced materials productivity and prospective approaches to addressing them, including but\nnot limited to:\n– Place based circular economy activities (e.g. industrial precincts and others enabled by urban planning\nand development)\niv", "text_len": 2772, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

{"source_file": "50.Australia’s circular economy Unlocking the oppertunities Inquiry report.pdf", "page_num": 11, "text": "Overview\nA circular economy uses materials in more sustainable and efficient ways. Economies have typically adopted\na linear ‘take, make, use, dispose’ model: raw materials are extracted, transformed into products, consumed,\nthen disposed of as waste. By contrast, a circular economy aims to meet human needs with fewer materials,\nreducing the environmental impacts and costs of economic activity.\nCircular economy activities can occur throughout the product life cycle and include: designing products to\nuse less materials (narrowing material loops); extending the time that products are consumed via reuse and\nrepair (slowing material loops); and recycling and recovering materials (closing material loops) (figure 1). A\nmore circular economy can be a more productive economy. With circular economy practices, we can more\nefficiently use the planet’s finite stock of natural capital to support our growing population and economy.\nThey can also reduce the harms to the environment, the climate and biodiversity associated with producing\nand consuming things. This in turn has benefits for society, such as better health and amenity, and fairer\noutcomes between generations, including by conserving resources and protecting environmental assets to\nsupport future economic activity.\nFigure 1 – Comparing the circular and linear economies\nLinear economy Circular economy\nRaw materials\nTake\nDesign\nMake\nRecycling\nProduction,\nremanufacturing\nUse\nResidual\nwaste\nCollection\nDistribution\nDispose\nConsumption,\nuse, reuse and\nrepair\nCircular economy practices are not new in Australia.

However, in practice, governments have some way to go on enabling true\npartnerships to achieve these aims and to enable economic development opportunities.\nAustralia’s progress towards a more circular economy\nAustralia’s materials productivity, circularity rate and waste recovery rate have increased slightly over the\npast decade, but progress has been slow (figure 2).1 Australia’s materials productivity of US$1.10 per kg lags\nthe OECD average of US$2.50, but this is largely due to the dominance of materials-intensive sectors in the\nAustralian economy. Materials productivity within sectors in Australia is on par with other OECD countries\nsuch as Japan, the Netherlands and Canada. This illustrates the limitations of relying on aggregate metrics\nbased solely on the total weight of materials used and consumed to identify opportunities to improve\nmaterials productivity and effectively measure progress.\nConventional productivity measures often do not fully reflect the important role of materials in the Australian\neconomy. For example, the Australian national accounts focus on labour, capital and multifactor productivity\nand do not explicitly report on materials productivity. Also, Australia’s productivity measures typically do not\ncapture the major impact that the depletion of natural capital (such as minerals, water and biodiversity), or its\ncapacity to provide ecosystem services, can have on future growth.\nFigure 2 – Circular economy indicators in Australia\na. Waste recovered for recycling, reuse or energy; data unavailable for 2007-08, 2011-12 and 2012-13.\nSome households and businesses have adopted circular practices for financial or commercial reasons. For\nexample, households can save money by repairing or reusing objects until the end of their life rather than\nreplacing them (slowing loops). And businesses can reduce their input and waste disposal costs by\ndesigning and manufacturing products that use less materials (narrowing loops). Households and\nbusinesses weigh these potential savings against the costs of circular practices, such as repair costs or the\ntime and investment needed to change production processes or business models.\nHouseholds and businesses have also incorporated sustainable practices into their activities out of concern\nfor the environment and future generations, and in response to changing societal expectations. A 2024\n1 Materials productivity is the amount of economic value (measured by GDP) generated per unit of materials used\n(measured by the weight of domestic materials consumption). The circularity rate is the proportion of non-virgin or\nrecycled materials used against overall materials used. The waste recovery rate is the proportion of waste that is diverted\nfrom landfill and reused, recycled or used in waste to energy activities.\n4", "text_len": 2912, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Ninety-seven per cent of\nthe ASX100 companies reported on their sustainability performance in 2024 and climate-related financial\ndisclosures have been mandatory for large companies since January 2025.\nCircular economy-related policies in Australia are in early stages of development, but in several areas are\nevolving rapidly. Most governments have recently introduced, and are continuing to develop, policies and\nreforms that promote greater circularity in different parts of the economy.\nAll levels of government have policies that support the circular economy.2 Broadly, the Australian\nGovernment is responsible for: national legislation, strategies and policy frameworks including international\ncommitments (such as climate change); tax settings; research and development; international trade; and\nmatters of national environmental significance. It also provides national leadership on initiatives that span\njurisdictions or industries. State and territory governments have responsibilities for: waste management and\nresource recovery; infrastructure development and essential service delivery; environmental policy; and the\nenforcement of environmental regulations. Local governments provide waste management services, manage\nlocal infrastructure and promote awareness among residents (such as how to correctly sort waste). All levels\nof government provide financial incentives for circular activities through means such as direct funding or\nsustainable procurement policies.\nGovernment policies related to materials productivity have traditionally focused on recycling. However,\ngovernments are increasingly focusing on earlier stages of the product life cycle, implementing policies that\nreduce materials use or its impacts on the environment. Many of these initiatives are still in their early stages.\nAt a strategic level, the Australian Government’s 2024 Australia’s Circular Economy Framework seeks to\nprompt action across the whole product life cycle and highlights the important role of national policy\nleadership in Australia’s transition to greater circularity.\nAddressing barriers to circularity\nHouseholds and businesses can face barriers to taking up circular practices. Some circular practices are\ncostly to adopt, requiring investment in new technology, paying for different inputs or transport, or increasing\nthe scale of operation. A lack of information, or prescriptive, outdated or inconsistent regulations can also\nprevent businesses from implementing more circular practices. Further, many circular economy activities\nrequire coordination between and across businesses, governments, community groups and households.\nWithout this, it can be difficult to build connections between relevant stakeholders and share knowledge\nabout best practice.\nGovernments can support progress by ensuring regulations adequately protect the environment and human\nhealth without discouraging businesses from adopting newer or less widespread technologies and practices.\nGovernments can also provide information and help stakeholders to coordinate. However, governments\nshould also be mindful that some circular practices come with trade-offs. For example, even with the right\n2 Some policies directly target materials use and waste, such as waste levies on landfill.

These opportunities were identified based on the environmental and\neconomic significance of the materials involved and how readily they can be applied in Australia and driven\nor implemented by government (figure 3). Some of these opportunities also relate to the delivery and\nmanagement of essential service sectors such as water and energy.\nThe PC also identified opportunities that span multiple sectors across the economy: a taskforce to drive\nregulatory reforms and harmonisation; challenge-based funding for innovation; measures to support\nplace-based initiatives; and an outcomes framework and metrics to support the implementation, monitoring\nand evaluation of circular economy reforms. These are relatively low-cost, high-impact initiatives and\nchanges that could help enable circular economy activities across a range of contexts.\nFigure 3 – Priority opportunities explored in this reporta,b\na. Statistics show contribution and impacts in Australia. b. Industry output statistics are industry value added for 2023-24.\nc. Built environment statistics are for the construction sector. d. The food, agriculture and organics sector is comprised of\nthe following subsectors: agriculture; aquaculture; forestry and logging; fishing, hunting and trapping; agriculture, forestry\nand fishing support services; food product manufacturing; beverage and tobacco product manufacturing; grocery, liquor\nand tobacco product wholesaling; food retailing; and food and beverage services. e. Emissions statistics are for direct\n(scope 1) emissions.\nThe PC’s recommendations seek to complement existing government activities. During this inquiry,\ngovernments have taken action to reduce regulatory barriers to prefabricated housing, recognise the carbon\nbenefits of biomethane in Australia’s carbon reporting system and increase transparency in business\nsustainability through mandatory climate-related financial disclosures. They have also undertaken reviews.\nFor example, the Recycling and Waste Reduction Act Review has been tasked with making\nrecommendations to improve the efficiency and impact of the Act in addressing current and future circular\neconomy needs, resource recovery and waste challenges.\n6\nB\n•\n•\n•\n•\nE\n•\n•\n•\nC\n•\n•\nc d u ilt e n v ir o n m e n t F o o d , a g r ic u lt u r e a n d o r g a n ic s M in in g\n9 % o f in d u s try o u tp u t • 9 % o f in d u s try o u tp u t • 1 7 % o f in d u s try o u tp u t\n4 2 % o f n o n -m e ta llic • 2 2 % o f d o m e s tic • 8 6 % o f d o m e s tic\nm in e ra ls c o n s u m p tio n m a te ria l fo o tp rin t m a te ria ls e x tra c tio n\ne 2 6 % o f a ll w a s te g o in g to la n d fill • 1 1 % o f A u s tra lia ’s to ta l e m is s io n s • 4 x w a s te o f o th e r s e c to rs c o m\nP rio rity o p p o rtu n itie s P rio rity o p p o rtu n itie s P rio rity o p p o rtu n itie s : u s e o f • : re c o v e rin g • : re u s e\ns u s ta in a b le m a te ria ls in v a lu e fro m w a s te d o rg a n ic m a te ria ls o f p o s t-m in in g la n d , in fra s tru c\nin fra s tru c tu re a n d re s id u e s\nle c t r o n ic s T e x t ile s a n d c lo t h in g\n2 2 k g e -w a s te p e r p e rs o n e a c h y e a r • 3 9 k g c o n s u m e d p e r p e rs o n e a c h y e a r\n(a lm o s t 3 x g lo b a l a v e ra g e ) (2 .5 x g lo b a l a v e ra g e )\nH a z a rd o u s w a s te in c lu d e s lith iu m , c o b a lt, n ic k e l • 3 3 k g d is p o s e d p e r p e rs o n e a c h y e a r\nP rio rity o p p o rtu n itie s P rio rity o p p o rtu n itie s : p ro d u c t s te w a rd s h ip fo r s m a ll • : c re a tin g a c c o u n ta b ilitie s\ne le c tro n ic s , s o la r P V s y s te m s a n d E V b a tte rie s fo r te x tile s s te w a rd s h ip\nr o s s - s e c t o r a l\n• C h a lle n g e -b a s e d fu n d in g fo r in n o v a tio n T a s k fo rc e to d riv e re g u la to ry re fo rm s a n d\nh a rm o n is a tio n • O u tc o m e s fra m e w o rk a n d m e tric s to s u p p o rt th e\nim p le m e n ta tio n , m o n ito rin g a n d e v a lu a tio n o f re fo rm s M e a s u re s to s u p p o rt p la c e -b a s e d in itia tiv e s\nb\ntu\nin e d\nre", "text_len": 4538, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "50.Australia’s circular economy Unlocking the oppertunities Inquiry report.pdf", "page_num": 15, "text": "Overview\nThis report also reiterates recommendations from previous PC reports that would promote greater circularity.\nFor example, the PC’s Right to Repair inquiry recommended competition, consumer protection and\nintellectual property reforms to increase consumers’ ability to access competitive repair services for products\nsuch as cars, agricultural machinery and small electronics.\nThis report also identifies ongoing and future policy opportunities and challenges for further government attention.\nStreamlining regulations to encourage circular activities\nCircular economy opportunities span multiple sectors, locations and processes. Businesses pursuing these\nopportunities are often affected by many regulations such as health, environmental and planning rules.\nRegulations can protect us from adverse outcomes and engender community trust. But some regulations\nand policies favour linear processes or limit the adoption of circular practices. Updating these would level the\nplaying field for newer or less widespread technologies and practices that improve materials productivity.\nGovernments should pursue opportunities to streamline regulations and encourage business to\nadopt innovative technologies and practices in three areas.\n• Reducing overly restrictive standards and specifications relating to infrastructure construction.\nThis could provide access to lower cost, better performing and more sustainable materials. The benefits\ncould be significant. In the next four years alone, investment in future public infrastructure is expected to\ntotal $270 billion and efficient net zero transition policy developments are likely to present opportunities for\nless emissions intensive construction materials. Australian governments need to form a definitive,\nconsistent position on which standards or specifications are too conservative or outdated, and where\nchanges will have the biggest impact. To this end, the Australian, state and territory governments should\nset up a working group to undertake a staged stocktake and assessment of standards and specifications,\nincluding Australian Standards and state infrastructure technical specifications. The assessment should\nshortlist changes to standards and specifications that could significantly increase the uptake of sustainable\nmaterials in infrastructure without compromising safety. These may include replacing prescriptive\nstandards and specifications with performance-based criteria or harmonising standards and specifications\nacross states and territories.3\n• Reforming uncertain and restrictive regulations governing the production and use of materials\nderived from wasted organic material (such as biochar and compost). This could reduce reliance on\nvirgin materials in applications such as fertilisers and result in environmental and/or economic benefits\nfrom nature regeneration. The Australia New Zealand Biochar Industry Group estimates that Australia has\nan annual biochar production potential of up to 30 million tonnes by 2050, up from a domestic production\nof approximately 20,000 tonnes in 2020. However, regulatory gaps create substantial uncertainty for\nbiochar users and investors and are limiting uptake. State and territory governments should develop\ndedicated regulatory pathways that outline the requirements for organic waste to transition into saleable\nmaterials, beginning with biochar.\n• Revising regulations affecting mine closure and transition to make it easier to repurpose mined\nland and infrastructure for a broader range of uses (such as clean energy projects), and to reuse\n3 Reforming standards and specifications for infrastructure would build on reforms already underway to reduce regulatory\nbarriers to prefabricated construction. The PC has previously estimated that these reforms could contribute $2.9–5.7 billion\nto GDP by reducing build times and costs. Removing barriers to prefabricated construction could improve materials\nproductivity through on-site waste reduction and enabling design for disassembly, which can make it easier to repair and\nrefurbish dwellings.\n7", "text_len": 4074, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

With around 240 Australian mines expected to end their economically productive life\nbetween 2021 and 2040, the economic, social and environmental benefits of greater flexibility in the\nrepurposing of mined land, infrastructure and residues could be substantial.4 To enable innovative\npost-mining land uses that have broader benefits for the community, state and territory governments\nshould review their regulatory frameworks and processes that guide mine closure and transition. The\nreviews should identify processes that could better accommodate repurposing mined land and\ninfrastructure without compromising broader regulatory objectives. A recent NSW parliamentary inquiry\ninto beneficial and productive post-mining land use made similar recommendations for NSW mines.\nReducing (and where possible avoiding) unnecessary inconsistencies in regulations across jurisdictions\npromotes circularity by reducing costs for businesses operating across state and territory borders. Different\nsettings for different jurisdictions can be justified where local environments, activities and preferences differ.\nBut in other cases, jurisdictional regulations could be harmonised – particularly where the differences\nbetween states and territories are definitional or administrative, rather than substantive or relating to\noutcomes. Harmonising administrative requirements reduces the regulatory burden on businesses with\nnational operations and reduces frictions for businesses deciding where or whether to expand.\nExamples of potentially unnecessary inconsistencies in standards and regulations across states and\nterritories include:\n• differences in specifications on allowable content for recycled materials in infrastructure construction\nprojects, even where standards are based on the same data and industry standards. For example, New\nSouth Wales’s specification for allowable recycled crushed glass as granular base and subbase in road\npavement is 10%, whereas in Victoria it is 5–10% for granular base and 15–50% for granular subbase\n• inconsistent waste classifications, including for organics, e-waste and products made using recycled\nwaste. For example, over 20 different regulations govern the classification, transport and management of\nplastic waste in Australia.\nA taskforce to drive regulatory reforms and harmonisation\nTo support the transition to a circular economy, the Australian Government should set up a Circular\nEconomy Regulatory Reform Taskforce with state and territory governments. While governments are already\nharmonising some regulations, a taskforce with dedicated resources and ministerial authorisation would\nstrengthen governments’ capacity to reform and harmonise regulations where it would have the largest\nbenefits. To operate effectively, the taskforce should meet regularly, respond to emerging issues, consider\ncircular economy issues from a range of portfolios, and make regulatory reform recommendations that\nbalance broader government objectives and specific regulatory outcomes.\nStates and territories are considering developing their own product stewardship schemes in the absence of a\nnational scheme. For example, New South Wales has committed to introducing Australia’s first state-based,\nmandatory product stewardship framework for battery products, including small electronics, and some states\nand territories are considering similar legislation. Without coordination across jurisdictions, these state-based\nefforts risk further fragmenting the regulatory environment. The taskforce would enable governments to\nagree on a core set of design features that provide consistency, such as consistent definitions of product\nscope, clear performance targets for collection and recovery, nationally aligned compliance standards,\nnationally transferable scheme registration requirements, and shared data and reporting requirements. This\n4 For example, the former Rhonda Colliery mine in Lake Macquarie, New South Wales is being transformed into a motor\npark and tourist destination. The NSW Government indicated that this will create more than 450 jobs during construction\nand 229 permanent roles.\n8", "text_len": 4220, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

However, given the costs of establishing, operating and\ncomplying with regulated product stewardship schemes, they should be reserved for products with\nparticularly high-risk and/or high-value waste streams, and only proceed where there is analysis\ndemonstrating they would have net benefits.\nThere is mounting evidence the Australian Government should progress a national product stewardship\nscheme for small-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Australia’s clean energy transition is rapidly increasing\nthe amount of waste from electronic products, such as solar PV systems and electric vehicle (EV) batteries,\nand creating an emerging issue for resource recovery and environmental management. The Australian\nGovernment has commissioned analysis that estimates a national product stewardship scheme for small-scale\nsolar PV systems could have a net economic benefit, in present value terms, of $7.3 billion. The Australian\nGovernment should also analyse the net benefits of national product stewardship for EV batteries.\nThe fast growth in small electronics in Australia and problems associated with incorrect disposal (such as fire\nrisks) also requires urgent attention. New South Wales and other states are progressing state-level product\nstewardship schemes for battery products including small electronics. Given this, the Australian Government\nshould assist and work with jurisdictions to develop and implement a national framework that ensures a\nconsistent approach to small electronics product stewardship across states and territories.\nFor products with less hazardous waste streams and where recent international policy and standard\ndevelopments could drive increased circularity of products supplied to Australia, the (current) balance of\ncosts and benefits may not justify immediately introducing a regulated approach to product stewardship.\nGovernments should still, however, support the transition to a circular economy for these products through\ngraduated measures, monitoring international policy and market developments, and by improving the\nevidence base. For example, the Australian Government should introduce enhanced monitoring and public\ntransparency measures to create greater accountability for textiles businesses to reduce waste and improve\nmaterials productivity.\nCoordination, collaboration and capacity building\nCoordination and collaboration across business, community groups and government (such as exchanging\nmaterials, knowledge and learnings) are often vital to realising circular economy opportunities. However,\nindividual organisations (particularly small to medium sized businesses) can face difficulties building these\nconnections, due to lack of knowledge, time or funds. They can also face challenges navigating complex\nregulatory processes across several levels and departments of government.\nGovernment can help facilitate this coordination, lowering coordination costs for an individual business. Not\nonly does this support the uptake of circular economy practices, it also creates opportunities for businesses\nto diversify their production processes and build capability in sustainable practices.\nThis report recommends three ways for governments to improve coordination, collaboration and capacity\nacross business, community groups and government, and facilitate the transition to a circular economy.\n9", "text_len": 3833, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

A challenge-based grant program\ncould help businesses, government and researchers across sectors and disciplines coordinate their efforts.\nMission-oriented or challenge-based innovation aligns research, innovation and policy around clear,\nambitious goals and encourages cross-disciplinary collaboration. To ensure the program offers value for\nmoney and facilitates whole-of-economy change, the program should seek solutions that lower barriers to\ncircular practices from across the supply chain and have broader public benefits (such as developing reuse\nopportunities for solar PV systems). Challenge-based programs in the United States and United Kingdom\nhave successfully stimulated innovation and delivered value for money.\nFacilitate place-based initiatives\nPlace-based initiatives enable coordination, address distance challenges and support businesses to develop\nand share new ideas. For example, local businesses can use their neighbours’ byproducts as material inputs\nfor their own production and learn from each other about innovative circular practices. They can also help\ngovernments tailor policies to the specific circumstances of a place and engage the local community as\nactive participants in development and implementation. 5\nState and territory governments should facilitate place-based initiatives by providing guidance and\nresources, such as templates, to assist local governments developing circular economy plans. They should\nalso fund a pilot for circular economy transition brokers. These brokers would help build the circular economy\nknowledge and capability of local governments and small to medium sized organisations in ways that are\ntailored to their context, and help them navigate government processes, such as regulatory approvals.\nTransition brokers would work in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to embed\nvaluable knowledge in place-based circular economy practices and support Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander people and businesses to lead circular economy activities.\nIn regions that are expected to experience mine closures, state and territory governments should develop\nland transition plans that identify the mined land, infrastructure and residues that will become available as\nmines close and how they can best be used. They should develop these land transition plans, well prior to\nthe point of closure, in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and local communities.\nIntroduce and expand services that build connections between and within government and\nindustry to enhance the impact of government sustainable procurement policies\nKnowledge gaps and a lack of experience can discourage industry from using recycled and other sustainable\nmaterials in infrastructure. Contractors and asset owners are sometimes unaware of what sustainable\nalternative materials are available. They may lack confidence about the quality or performance of these\nmaterials and can tend to rely on familiar materials to avoid uncertainty affecting their focus on other delivery\nobjectives (such as quality or speed).\nTo promote industry confidence in sustainable infrastructure materials, state and territory governments with\ncommitments to major infrastructure projects should introduce or expand support services. These services\nshould include dedicated personnel as facilitators that work with suppliers, contractors and asset owners to\nincrease uptake of sustainable materials. Facilitators should provide education about the uses of sustainable\n5 ‘Place’ does not have a universal definition.

These types of services have proven\nsuccessful in Victoria, which is the main jurisdiction to offer them. Since its inception in 2019, the ecologiQ\nprogram has supported the Victorian Government’s Recycled First policy to incorporate 3.4 million tonnes of\nrecycled materials in major public infrastructure, with numerous participants highlighting its effectiveness.\nImplementing reforms and monitoring progress\nCircular economy policy in Australia is still in its early stages. For some reform areas, the issues are\nrelatively well known and the supporting evidence base for designing reforms is relatively well developed. In\nthese areas, full implementation should progress. For other reform areas, including those in which future\nopportunities for policy change arise, governments will need to undertake further work to better understand\nhow to design policy changes to have the greatest net benefits.6 Governments should gather additional\ninformation to understand and, where possible, quantify the benefits of intervention options. This can be\ndone through, for example, life cycle analyses or bespoke impact studies. In some cases, a staged approach\nto policy implementation is preferred, to monitor policy implementation or assess how the impacts of recent\ninternational policy actions on supply chains affect Australian markets.\nThe Australian Government should develop an outcomes framework that connects each circular economy\npolicy action to its related economic, social and environmental goals. This will help governments implement,\nmonitor and evaluate circular economy reforms. For example, removing restrictive regulations could promote\ncircular activities and innovation across the product life cycle, and improve environmental, economic and\nsocial outcomes. This may in turn help to achieve circular policy goals, such as circular economy targets\n(figure 4). The development of the outcomes framework will enable the inclusion of government actions that\npromote the transition to a circular economy. A starting point could be to include, for example, actions from\nthe National Waste Policy, actions to end plastic waste and actions recommended in this report, but the\nultimate scope will depend on the targets and outcomes that are chosen.\nThe outcomes framework will create a common strategic vision. It will ensure that progress is aligned across\nall governments and that agencies are clear on the outcomes policies should be achieving. It will also enable\ngovernments to identify and collect the data necessary to monitor circular economy policies, promoting\ntransparency, accountability and ongoing improvements.\nThe Australian Government should use the outcomes framework to identify and fill gaps in data or\nmeasurement, such as in markets or sectors where there are policies aimed at encouraging businesses to\nincorporate circular design principles in product design.\nTo ensure actions are sequenced effectively across all levels of government, the report includes an\nindicative phased timeline to guide the implementation of its recommendations, with separate timelines for\nthe Australian Government, state and territory governments, and local governments.\n6 For example, further work is required to determine trial locations for place-based transition brokers and further work is\nrequired to determine the specific standards that impede the use of recycled materials in infrastructure.\n11", "text_len": 3605, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

These materials generally replenish at a\nslow rate or do not replenish at all.\n• Make involves manufacturing goods using the extracted raw materials.\n• Use involves consuming goods until they are no longer deemed useful or are used up.\n• Dispose involves discarding goods – generally in landfill.\nFigure 1.1 – The linear economy model\nEnvironmental and economic drawbacks of the linear economy\nThroughout the 20th century, product life cycles were predominantly linear. However, growing concerns over the\nlocal and global environmental impacts of the linear economy have prompted a rethink. Australian production and\nconsumption decisions can impact the natural environment locally as well as globally. Conversely, the\nenvironmental impacts of production and consumption decisions in other countries can also affect Australia.\nThese environmental impacts begin at the ‘take’ stage of linear product life cycles. Globally, around 55% of\ngreenhouse gas emissions result from extracting and processing material resources (UNEP 2024a, p. xiv).\nThese processes also contribute directly to waste streams. Additionally, biomass extraction and production\nare responsible for over 90% of land use-related biodiversity loss and water stress, posing a major risk to\nspecies extinction (UNEP 2024a, p. xiv).\nEnvironmental impacts also occur at the ‘make’ stage. In 2021, greenhouse gas emissions from\nmanufacturing and construction activities made up 13% of total global emissions (based on Ritchie et\nal. 2024). If unregulated, waste from these activities can also pollute surrounding waterways and land.\nAt the ‘dispose’ stage in a linear economy, products are generally discarded into landfill with no further use.\nThe availability of sites for new landfills is an ongoing concern for Australian communities and local\n1 Despite the term ‘economy’, this model relates only to the flow of physical materials. In a sense, the economy is\nanything but linear considering the decisions, relationships and transactions that feed into its complexity.\n22", "text_len": 2657, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For example, estimates suggest that the landfills servicing Greater Sydney will reach capacity\nby around 2030, with no suitable options currently available for new landfill sites (NSW EPA 2024; Veolia\nAustralia and New Zealand, sub. 8, p. 5).2 This poses a significant concern to the future security of Sydney’s\nwaste management system. Internationally, countries are addressing concerns about environmental and\nhealth impacts of processing hazardous waste exported from countries like Australia by increasingly\nimposing restrictions on waste imports (Donovan and Pickin 2021, p. 10).\nEven if suitable land is found to increase landfill availability, major environmental, public health and safety\nconcerns remain with the transport and disposal of wasted materials into landfill (DCCEEW 2024c, p. 19). Landfill\nhas negative impacts on the environment, including on biodiversity and air quality. For instance, leachate3 from\nlandfills can contaminate groundwater and pose a risk to the biodiversity and regenerative capacity of surrounding\necosystems. Additionally, landfill gas (predominantly carbon dioxide and methane) poses a risk to air quality. If not\nproperly managed, it can create odours and worsen climate change (EPA Victoria 2020).\nQuestions around the sustainability of the linear model were initially driven predominantly by environmental\nconcerns. However, increased circularity can also have economic and productivity benefits, including\nintergenerationally, by more efficiently using the planet’s finite stocks of natural capital (materials) to support\na growing population and economy. The benefits of more sustainable development can also contribute to\nsocial outcomes such as better health and amenity, and more sustainable development. Shifting to a circular\nmodel reduces some of the negative environmental and economic impacts of the linear model.\nFull circle on the product life cycle\nThere are a range of circular economy opportunities that can lead to environmental and economic benefits\n(detailed examples for key sectors are discussed in the interim report). Some circular economy opportunities\nrelate to ensuring products and related materials remain in the industrial cycle, such as through reuse, repair\nand recycling. Other opportunities relate to restoring natural materials cycles and regenerating natural\necosystems. Whilst this inquiry addresses some aspects of nature regeneration, such as returning\nresource-rich organic materials to the environment, there are a wider set of nature positive circular economy\nopportunities that are beyond the focus of this report, reflecting the inquiry’s terms of reference.\nCircular activities throughout the product life cycle can relate to reducing how much raw material is extracted\nto make the product, repairing and reusing the product as much as possible, and lowering the amount of\nwaste sent to landfill by collecting and recycling materials (figure 1.2). These activities can be categorised\ninto closing, slowing or narrowing resource loops, a framework which has been adopted broadly (Bocken et\nal. 2016, p. 309; DCCEEW 2024c, p. 49). Circular activities encompass flows of materials and resources\nbetween different products, sectors and supply chains.\n• Closing resource loops: These activities link the production and disposal stages, allowing for circularity\nin resource flows. Recycling activities, such as extracting and reusing materials from old batteries, close\nresource loops (BSC, sub. 140, p. 10).\n• Slowing resource loops: These activities aim to increase the use of the product by either extending the\nproduct’s life, increasing the ways in which the product can be used, or both. Activities that slow resource\nloops include designing products for durability, reusing products and repairing products. Repairing clothing\nto extend its useful life is one example of this activity (WasteLess | SEE Change, sub. 239, pp. 1–2).\n2 Approvals for new landfill sites involve a lengthy process due to suitability checks and community consultation.\n3 Leachate is a liquid contaminant prevalent in landfills. It is produced when rainwater and other moisture accumulates\nsubstances of concern that are released from the decomposition of waste.\n23", "text_len": 4255, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

At scale, these activities reduce the aggregate demand for raw materials.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledges, practices and expertise also need to be\nrecognised in circular economy policies in ways that benefit communities, and respect and protect cultural\nand intellectual property rights. Opportunities raised by participants and in literature include Aboriginal and\nTorres Strait Islander-led initiatives in resource management, agriculture and environmental stewardship,\nlearning from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander practices in policy design, and partnering with\ncommunities in decision-making.6\nWhy does moving to a circular economy matter?\nThe economy can be strengthened while lowering materials use\nUsing less materials does not necessarily mean slower economic growth. In the last 40 years, the Australian\neconomy has grown substantially while materials use has increased at a much slower rate (sometimes called\n‘decoupling’ economic activity from materials – figure 1.4). Though many factors can contribute to\ndecoupling, in Australia this was in large part due to a shift towards services, which use significantly less\nmaterials than goods production. In the five decades between 1970 and 2020, the share of Australian\neconomic activity generated by services has increased from 66% to 81% (PC 2021b, p. 6).\nFigure 1.4 – Australia’s materials usage has grown more slowly than GDP since 1980\nMaterials decoupling in Australia, 1970–2023a,b\na. Economic activity, measured through GDP, is used as it is not possible to quantify total welfare. While not a perfect\nproxy for societal welfare, economic activity is considered a significant contributor to it. b. Materials use is represented by\nmaterial footprint.

The\nshift could contribute to economic growth by creating new markets, products and job opportunities. It could\nalso increase economic diversity and capability, as businesses adopt innovative business models that are\nfocused on sustainable design, reuse or recycling.\nCircular activities can also achieve social benefits\nWhile the environmental and economic aspects of the circular economy are relatively well understood, social\noutcomes are often overlooked. An analysis of 221 definitions of the circular economy found that only 24–27%\nconsidered all three domains in their stated objectives of the circular economy (Kirchherr et al. 2023, p. 5). The\nsocial benefits of circular activities stem from the importance of environmental quality for health and wellbeing.\nThese benefits can also include direct improvements in health and safety, enhanced amenity, greater social\ninclusion and support for Australians in need. For example, social enterprises engage in circular activities by\nconducting food rescue and distribution to those experiencing food insecurity, providing affordable repair services,\nand facilitating sharing models to increase reuse of products such as tools, toys and other household goods.7\nMany circular activities will have interrelated environmental, economic and social benefits. For example,\nreusing mine-site infrastructure for a renewable energy generation and storage project can limit\nenvironmental damage by reusing an existing cleared site and can benefit the environment by offering a less\npolluting and emissions-intensive source of energy. It may also offer social and economic benefits by\ncreating local jobs and increasing energy reliability.\nBy improving environmental, social and economic outcomes, a circular economy has the potential to support\nthe wellbeing of future generations. Globally, humanity is currently exceeding several planetary boundaries\nincluding those related to climate change and biodiversity loss, resulting in a heightened risk of severe and\nirreversible damage to the environment (Richardson et al. 2023, p. 1).8 Reducing materials extraction to\nlower biodiversity loss, avoid pollutants and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions should allow future\ngenerations to enjoy the same, if not better, levels of wellbeing as current generations.\nHowever, some circular activities can result in trade-offs\nWhile some circular economy activities can result in environmental, economic and social benefits, others can\nproduce one type of benefit at the expense of another. For example, policies can reduce waste and\nenvironmental impacts throughout the life cycle if they encourage businesses to design products and\npackaging that use more sustainable materials, or make it easier to recycle products. However, they can also\nincrease the upfront cost of purchasing products for households and businesses.\nThere may also be trade-offs within each dimension – for example, using recycled crushed glass for\ninfrastructure applications has the benefit of diverting excess glass from landfill and reducing the need for\nvirgin materials extraction,9 which has negative impacts on local ecosystems (UNEP 2023b). However, the\nprocessing of waste glass into recycled crushed glass is emissions-intensive, so can lead to worse\nemissions outcomes when compared to traditional virgin materials (ARRB 2022, pp. 12–13).\nUltimately, the goal of the circular economy is to improve overall public welfare. In designing circular\neconomy policies, a system-wide approach to analysing and monitoring the impact of policy levers is needed\nto identify and adjust for potential trade-offs.\n7 Australian Library of Things Network (sub. 59, p. 1); BCSDA (sub. 175, p. 8); OzHarvest (sub. 81, p. 9); Toy Libraries\nAustralia (sub. 130, p. 2).\n8 The planetary boundaries framework identifies nine processes that are critical for maintaining the stability and resilience of the\nEarth’s system and the boundaries, or safe operating limits, for those processes (Richardson et al. 2023, p. 1).\n9 Virgin materials are materials that are directly extracted from nature and have not been previously used or processed.\n28", "text_len": 4312, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Government policy settings also influence\nactions, such as through environmental protection regulation and enforcement, waste levies, sustainability\nrequirements in grants, procurement specifications, and a range of other legislated penalties or mechanisms\n(for example, the Safeguard Mechanism).10\nHouseholds and businesses can often save money by repairing objects or using them until the end of their\nlife, rather than replacing them prematurely. For businesses, production processes that require fewer\nmaterials can reduce input costs whilst also minimising waste. Businesses may also adopt circular\napproaches in response to preferences by consumers and/or shareholders for environmentally positive\nproducts, as this may create brand reputation and customer loyalty (ResiLoop Ltd, sub. 84, p. 5).\nBusinesses and households may also be motivated to take up circular economy activities by concern for\nfuture generations, societal expectations, altruism or other sustainability reasons. People who are motivated\nby a sense of responsibility to minimise their impact on the environment might choose to purchase\nsustainably produced goods and services or use goods for longer before replacing them. Businesses are\nincreasingly adopting environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles in their practices. There are\nalso community organisations and social enterprises which aim to increase circularity. For example, the\nReconnect Project (sub. 134, p. 1) and WorkVentures (ADIA, sub. 197, p. 13) repair and refurbish used\nelectronic devices to provide to disadvantaged groups.\n… but can also face barriers to adopting circular practices\nRegulations sometimes make it hard for businesses to adopt circular economy activities. While regulations\nreduce or mitigate the risks of adverse outcomes, regulations that are too prescriptive, outdated or\ncomplicated can hinder the uptake of more circular practices. For example, businesses wanting to develop\nand market innovative products from wasted materials rely on regulatory arrangements to ensure consumer\nand public confidence about the safety and environmental credentials of their products. Enforcement of\nregulations (such as to protect the environment from dumping or pollution) is also critical to their business, as\nthey underpin incentives for suppliers. However, where these businesses are creating ‘new’ products they\nmay find regulations complex and time-consuming to navigate. Inconsistent regulations across jurisdictions\ncan also pose barriers to businesses (chapter 7). Specific ways in which regulation hinders adoption are\nexplored in more detail in chapters 2 to 6.\nBusinesses also face costs when changing existing production processes and business models. For\nexample, accessing finance can be more difficult and expensive, because circular technologies may be\nrelatively new and expensive to implement; or lenders might perceive them as higher risk or challenging to\nvalue relative to traditional technologies. Where prices of virgin materials do not reflect the full environmental\ncosts associated with their extraction and production, this price relative to recycled material inputs\ndiscourages business from using or selling recycled inputs.\n10 The Safeguard Mechanism is a policy that requires Australia’s highest greenhouse gas emitting facilities to reduce\ntheir emissions in line with Australia’s emission reduction targets (CER 2024a).\n29", "text_len": 3741, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Poor quality and availability of\ninformation about how products are made limits the ability of households and businesses to make\nsustainable choices, even if they wish to do so. Households and businesses may also not have clear\ninformation on the repairability, reuse potential or recyclability of different items. As a result, they may\ndispose of these items through landfill or recycle incorrectly and contaminate waste streams.11\nBusinesses, particularly small to medium sized businesses, may also lack the capability and resources to\nadopt circular opportunities. This includes lacking relevant information about potential circular economy\nopportunities, their practical applications and associated benefits (CIPS, sub. 161, p. 6; Vejnovic et al.,\nsub. 24, p. 3). For example, they may not know where to source feedstock or find buyers for wasted\nmaterials, face challenges navigating regulatory processes due to lack of capability or be unaware of\ngovernment and other programs that might provide financial support.12 They may also lack resources and\ncapability to form the networks necessary to coordinate with other businesses on circular opportunities\n(Roundtable participants, pers. comm., 29 May 2025).\n1.3 The role for government in the circular economy\nGovernments play an important role in supporting overall community wellbeing, especially where the\ndecisions made by households and businesses (private actors) would not otherwise result in the best\noutcomes overall for the community (maximum net public benefits). As noted in this inquiry’s terms of\nreference, ‘regulatory frameworks and policy actions influence businesses’ and households’ decisions on\nmaterials purchasing, use and replacement or the competitiveness of circular economy initiatives.’\nSeveral reasons justify targeted government action to address barriers to improving materials productivity\nand support opportunities in the circular economy.\n• Externalities arise when costs or benefits from producing goods or services are not reflected in their\npurchase price. For example, environmental damage from resource extraction is a negative externality\nthat may not be included in prices.\n• A public good is something that anyone can use, such as clean air and biodiversity. Without government\naction, the value of these goods is often not protected sufficiently as no one is excluded from their use or\nprevented from harming them. Shared or freely available environmental resources are often overused.\n• Information asymmetry is when different parties have different amounts of information. This can make it\nhard to make decisions that benefit the community. For example, people who want to make sustainable\nchoices might not have enough information about the impact of their purchases.\n• Equality of opportunity means a fair distribution of resources, and options for how to use resources,\nacross society and over time. Governments may try to address inequalities, such as the environmental\nimpacts on future generations due to the current use of materials.\nGovernments should apply policy levers where the benefits to community wellbeing from doing so exceed\nthe costs – that is, where there is ‘public’ benefit. Government action is not warranted when the benefits are\npurely ‘private’. Quantifying benefits and costs, and valuing policy outcomes, is difficult – particularly when\noutcomes span interconnected economic, environmental and social dimensions as in the case of circular\neconomy policy. Governments also need to select and design policy mechanisms to appropriately target the\nactivities (of producers or consumers) or points in the supply chain most effective for achieving the desired\noutcome. Government policies and regulations may also have unintended consequences and costs.

For example, the European\nUnion has banned the destruction of returned or unsold textiles and footwear to reduce wasted materials\nand encourage the reuse of these products (EEA 2024).\n• Information instruments – government actions that increase or enhance the information available to\nenable consumers, companies and public institutions to make decisions that increase circularity. For\nexample, the French Government has introduced a repairability index, which indicates how easily\nrepairable a consumer electronics product is to inform consumer decision making and encourage the\nproduction of more repairable products (Sirera et al. 2024).\n• Measures to facilitate coordination – government actions that support businesses and other\norganisations to coordinate their actions to facilitate circular economy outcomes. For example, as part of\nthe implementation approach for circular economy policies in the Netherlands, governments in some\nregions have established circular economy transition brokers that support companies to implement circular\ninitiatives and foster collaboration between them (Cramer 2020, p. 3).\nAustralia’s circular economy policies\nCircular economy policies in Australia have evolved over time and predate the more widespread use of the\nterm ‘circular economy’. Australian governments have been managing waste for public safety and amenity\nreasons for a long time, initially focusing on disposal. This changed during the 1990s, with a growing\nappreciation that ‘the current high levels of consumption without the efficient use of resources and waste\nminimisation are not ecologically sustainable’ (Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and\nthe Arts 1994, p. 1). Policies shifted to also incorporate minimisation of wasted materials, with the National\nKerbside Recycling Strategy and National Waste Minimisation Strategy introduced in 1992 (Senate Standing\nCommittee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts 1994, p. 11).\nMore recently, all levels of government have introduced some policies that support the circular economy, with\ntheir responsibilities and activities reflecting the division of powers in the Australian Constitution (figure 1.5).\nMany policies directly relate to circular economy practices by targeting materials use and wasted materials,\nwhile others that are aimed at reducing negative environmental impacts more generally may also encourage\ngreater circularity. Circular practices can be influenced both positively and negatively by a wide range of other\npolicies, such as those targeting environmental conservation, climate change and regional development.\nBroadly, the Australian Government is responsible for national legislation, strategies and policy frameworks\nincluding international commitments (such as climate change); tax settings; research and development;\ninternational trade and matters of national environmental significance. It also provides national leadership on\ninitiatives that span jurisdictions or industries. Sustained leadership from the Australian Government is necessary\nto enable a coordinated approach by states and territories, including in areas such as product stewardship\n(chapter 5).

There has\nbeen a recent shift across all levels of government to pursue policies which focus on circular practices earlier in\nthe product life cycle that reduce materials use and/or associated impacts on the environment. While many\nsuch initiatives are still in their early stages, at a strategic level, the Australian Government’s 2024 National\nCircular Economy Framework seeks to prompt action across the whole product life cycle and highlights the\nimportant role of national policy leadership in setting the direction for Australia’s transition to greater circularity.\nCircular economy related policies in Australia are in the early stages of development but are evolving rapidly.\nGovernments have recently introduced, and are also still developing, policies and reforms that seek to\npromote greater circularity in different parts of the economy. During the PC’s inquiry, several governments\nhave made progress in reducing regulatory barriers to circular activities, such as reducing regulatory barriers\nto prefabricated housing (box 2.1) and fully recognising the carbon benefits of biomethane in Australia’s\ncarbon reporting system.13 There have also been improvements in the transparency of businesses’\nsustainability performance through mandatory public reporting of climate related financial disclosures for\nlarge entities (The Treasury 2024d, p. 2). The Australian Government Department of Climate Change,\nEnergy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) is currently completing a statutory review of the Recycling\nand Waste Reduction Act 2020 (Cth), which will consider ‘the limitations of the current approaches to product\nstewardship, including concerns around the viability, integrity and impact of stewardship schemes supported\nby the Act’ (DCCEEW 2025g). Recognising that the circular economy policy space is active and evolving, the\nPC has aimed to complement existing policy activities when conducting its analysis of priority opportunities\nand developing its recommendations.\nA wide range of other policies also affect the circular economy\nIn addition to government policies that are directly focused on shifting to a circular economy, there are also\npolicies, including those aimed at reducing environmental impacts more generally, that can encourage more\nefficient materials use.\nFor example, the Australian Government’s existing climate change policies – including the Renewable Energy\nTarget, Safeguard Mechanism, Australian Carbon Credit Unit Scheme, Capacity Investment Scheme and New\nVehicle Efficiency Standard – act to address the emissions-related negative externalities including those\nassociated with materials use and wasted materials. Circular economy opportunities that reduce greenhouse\ngas emissions by lowering materials extraction and use could be covered under these policies, to the extent\nthat the circular emission reduction methods are eligible under relevant schemes. However, as emissions\npolicies do not directly address other negative externalities – such as other types of air and water pollution,\nbiodiversity loss, and adverse impacts on human health and safety – they only partially account, and may\nthemselves contribute to, the environmental impacts arising from materials use and wasted materials.\nWater policies, such as the National Water Initiative, aim to improve the sustainable and productive\nmanagement of Australia’s water resources and increase water security for communities, industries and the\nenvironment. While a wider resources efficiency approach has not been used in this materials-focused\ninquiry, water-related policies, legislation and regulations play important roles in supporting circular\neconomy. These include those related to water efficiency (for example, Water Efficiency Labelling and\nStandards), recovery of resources from biosolids in wastewater that can support regeneration of nature, and\n13 By amending section 2.67C in the National Greenhouse Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination 2008 (Cth).\n33", "text_len": 4304, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Further, circular economy\nindicators are partial and imprecise measures on the environmental, economic and social impacts of\nmaterials use. For example, using tonnes of materials used to measure environmental impact does not\ncapture how the environmental impacts of producing one tonne of a material varies significantly depending\non the material being produced (European Commission nd). The PC also applied qualitative forms of\nevidence to guide and strengthen the approach to prioritisation. Further information on the prioritisation\nframework can be found in chapter 3 of the interim report.\nWhen assessing the viability of government action to reduce barriers to circular economy opportunities, and\nin developing recommendations, the PC has sought to complement existing policy activities. The PC\nrecognises that it is not operating on a blank slate and is not solving for all the potential barriers to the\ncircular economy and related environmental concerns.\n1.5 Applying the prioritisation framework\nApproach to prioritising opportunities and recommendations\nIn this inquiry, the PC undertook the following activities to prioritise and analyse circular economy\nopportunities, and proposes policy recommendations relating to these opportunities.\n1. Identify potential circular economy opportunities: Review the relevant literature, policy documents\nand inquiry submissions, and engage with a variety of industry, community, research and government\nparticipants to identify potential circular economy opportunities in Australia, and current and planned\ngovernment policy and programs.\n2. Assess circular economy opportunities and policies to address barriers to adoption: Apply the\nprioritisation considerations to understand the extent to which circular economy opportunities could result\nin environmental or economic benefits (for example, based on current and projected material and product\nuse, and waste generation), the applicability of the circular economy opportunity to Australia (for example,\ndue to industry structure) and the viability of government action to address relevant barriers.\n3. Prioritise circular economy opportunities and outline policy reform directions in the interim\nreport: Identify circular economy opportunities that perform well against the prioritisation criteria and\noutline potential directions for policy reform that address the barriers to their realisation (for example,\nmarket and regulatory failures).\n4. Seek feedback and refine policy analysis for the final report: Engage with inquiry participants\nfollowing the release of the interim report to test the identified circular economy opportunities, barriers\nand reform directions, and seek additional information to inform policy design, including implementation\nfeasibility and risks.\n5. Develop final policy recommendations: Finalise the identification of priority circular economy\nopportunities and develop a series of priority recommendations for government action.\n15 For example, Coreo (sub. 104, p. 14), Engineers Australia (sub. 108, p. 3), Mathur (sub. 10, p. 1), ResiLoop Ltd\n(sub. 84, p. 4), Swedish Australian Chamber of Commerce Sustainability Committee (sub. 94, p. 2), WALGA (sub. 167,\np. 2) and WARRRL (sub. 87, pp. 6-7).\n35", "text_len": 3546, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Create an outcomes framework and phased timelines for final recommendations: Establish how\npolicy actions lead to outcomes that progress the circular economy transition, identify implementation\nconsiderations and consider sequencing of recommended policy actions.\nSelected priority areas for circular economy opportunities\nIn this report, the PC examines circular economy opportunities in five priority sectors identified using the\nabove framework (chapters 2 to 6), several changes that would facilitate circular economy opportunities\nacross sectors (chapter 7), an outcomes framework and other considerations to guide implementation\n(chapter 8), metrics to measure progress in the uptake of these and other opportunities (chapter 9) and\nphased implementation pathways for government (chapter 10) (figure 1.6).16 Policies that prompt individual\nmarkets and supply chains to adopt more circular practices will go some way to achieving more circular\noutcomes (with associated economic and environmental benefits) at a national scale. However, for an\neconomy-wide transformation, policies that take a more systemic approach and consider the\ninterconnectedness of markets and sectors are also necessary.\nThere is some cross-over between the sectors identified by the PC and the sectors selected for deep dives\nin the Circular Economy Ministerial Advisory Group’s final report: built environment, food and agriculture,\nresources, and water (DCCEEW 2024c). While the PC did not undertake a detailed examination of all\ncircular economy opportunities in all the sectors suggested by participants, the PC has identified\ncross-sectoral opportunities to improve circularity (chapter 7), with broader applicability than the five priority\nsectors. For example, the PC considered if, and how, inconsistent regulations, standards and specifications\nacross Australia should be addressed, and this may include settings that apply to other sectors.\nFigure 1.6 – Priority sectors, cross-sectoral opportunities, outcomes framework and\nmetrics to support implementation\nCross-sectoral and implementation\nBuilt environment (chapter 2) (chapters 7,8,9,10)\n• Taskforce to drive regulatory\nreforms and harmonisation\nFood, agriculture and organics\n(chapter 3) • Measures to support place-\nSCE VERSION\nbased initiatives\n• Challenge-based funding for\nMining(chapter 4)\ninnovation\n• Outcomes framework and\nmetrics to support the\nElectronics(chapter 5) implementation, monitoring and\nevaluation of reforms\n• Pathways for Australian\nTextiles and clothing (chapter 6) governments\n16 Discussion of relevant opportunities relating to vehicles identified in the interim report are now addressed within the\ncontext of mining (chapter 4) and electronics (chapter 5).\n36", "text_len": 2809, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Construction processes and\nassociated manufacturing activities are responsible for 2% and 8.4% of Australia’s emissions respectively\n(PC estimates, based on DCCEEW 2023c).2 Additionally, landfilled construction and demolition materials\ncan lead to the leaching of contaminants into soil and water systems (Molla et al. 2021, pp. 7–8).\nIn the interim report, the Productivity Commission evaluated opportunities for government action to promote\ngreater circularity across the built environment life cycle – including planning, design, construction, use and\nrecycling – to improve materials productivity and economic and environmental outcomes (PC 2025a). Of these\nopportunities, two priorities for further government action emerged: reviewing standards and specifications that\nhamper the use of sustainable materials in infrastructure projects (section 2.2), and strengthening sustainable\ninfrastructure procurement through targeted facilitation and coordination initiatives (section 2.3).\nThe interim report highlighted reducing regulatory impediments to prefabricated construction as a potential\nreform direction. Since then, governments have implemented several new and ongoing initiatives to address\nregulatory barriers to prefabricated construction. If delivered effectively and on schedule, these initiatives\ncould unlock significant economic and environmental benefits. These reforms will also contribute to broader\npolicy goals and the associated social benefits, such as delivering 1.2 million homes by 2030 under the\nNational Housing Accord – which is currently projected to fall short by 285,000 homes (Husic 2024; Master\nBuilders Australia 2025) (box 2.1). As a result, the PC has not recommended further government action in\nprefabricated construction beyond existing initiatives.\nInfrastructure assessment frameworks and integrated urban planning have a significant impact on material\nuse in the built environment. While many governments promote efficient and sustainable infrastructure and\nhave outlined goals for integrated planning across transport and urban water, there remains scope to\nenhance materials productivity by ensuring consistent adherence to these principles.3 Robust public\ninfrastructure investment processes are a key strategy in advancing environmental outcomes. For example,\nby choosing not to proceed with projects that lack clear societal net benefits, governments can avoid\nunnecessary materials use and wastage. While the planning and design stages play a critical role in\ndetermining the long-term sustainability and materials productivity of infrastructure, this inquiry did not extend\nto a detailed review of Australian, state, and territory government frameworks for integrated and sustainable\ninfrastructure development. Nonetheless, the PC reaffirms relevant recommendations from previous inquiries\nthat address infrastructure planning and development (chapter 8). If adopted, these actions would also help\ndeliver stronger economic and environmental outcomes in infrastructure.\n2 Using 2023 emissions, the ‘associated manufacturing activities’ estimate is calculated by dividing the sum of ‘Non\nMetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing’, ‘Primary Metal and Metal Product Manufacturing’, ‘Fabricated Metal Product\nManufacturing’, and ‘Wood, Pulp, Paper and Printing’ by ‘Total of all Economic (ANZSIC) Sectors’.\n3 Examples of governments promoting efficient and sustainable infrastructure investment include DCCEEW (2024n,\np. 13), WA DoT (2024a, p. 4), and Infrastructure NSW (2024, p. 7). Integrated transport and water planning examples\ninclude DELWP (2017), Infrastructure NSW (2022), NSW DPIE (2022), SA DHUD (2019) and VIC DTP (2024a).\n39", "text_len": 3771, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The purpose of this stocktake and assessment would be to help\ngovernments form a definitive, consistent position on which changes to standards and specifications (that\nare limiting the use of sustainable materials in infrastructure) would have the largest net benefits.\nThis would help address widespread concerns in the built environment sector that many construction\nstandards and specifications unnecessarily restrict the use of recycled and other sustainable materials\n(box 2.2). Some of these concerns relate to standards or specifications being too prescriptive, conservative\nor oriented towards traditional materials (for example, concrete and cement standards restrict the use of\nrecycled and low carbon additives). Other concerns relate to variations in standards and specifications\nacross states and territories which can increase costs to businesses that operate across multiple jurisdictions\n(for example, allowable content specifications used by transport agencies vary across states and territories).\nBox 2.2 – Examples of restrictive or inconsistent standards or specifications\nA range of participants, from industry associations and businesses to government agencies, reported\nthat current standards and specifications are a barrier to the uptake of recycled and sustainable\nconstruction materials.\nRestrictive standards and specifications\nSeveral participants noted standards and specifications are often overly conservative, prescriptive and\nwritten with traditional materials in mind, therefore limiting allowable recycled content or prescribing that\na conventional material must be used.

Some recycled materials (such as crumbed rubber) have negative life cycle environmental impacts associated\nwith their usage (such as micro plastics), and these impacts must be considered when determining a material’s overall\nsuitability as a sustainable alternative (Environment and Communications Committee 2025, pp. 98–99).\n5 Standards generally refer to high-level design and performance requirements for a product or process (such as\nAustralian Standards). They can be voluntary or mandatory. Voluntary standards can be made mandatory by being\nreferenced in regulations or specifications. Specifications are developed by asset owners (for example, transport\ndepartments) and set requirements for a project or asset type when engaging in contracts. Voluntary specifications are\nalso developed by organisations (such as Austroads) and can be adopted by agencies for use in contracts. Most state\ninfrastructure agencies have a jurisdictionally distinct, consistent set of technical specifications that are used in\ninfrastructure procurement (Austroads 2021; Standards Australia 2025b; Sustainability Victoria 2023; TfNSW 2025).\n41\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | \n | Box 2.2 – Examples of restrictive or inconsistent standards or specifications | \n |  | \n | A range of participants, from industry associations and businesses to government agencies, reported | \n | that current standards and specifications are a barrier to the uptake of recycled and sustainable | \n | construction materials. | \n | Restrictive standards and specifications | \n | Several participants noted standards and specifications are often overly conservative, prescriptive and | \n | written with traditional materials in mind, therefore limiting allowable recycled content or prescribing that | \n | a conventional material must be used.

The Australian Council of Recycling’s submission and co-authored\nreport highlighted instances where states have notably different recycled content limits in procurement\nspecifications despite the procurement specifications referencing the same national standard (ACOR,\nsub. 75, pp. 183–213; Standards Australia and ACOR 2023, pp. 25–26). For example, the NSW\nGovernment’s specification for allowable recycled crushed glass as granular base and subbase in road\npavement is 10%, whereas in Victoria it is 5–10% for granular base and 15–50% for granular subbase\n(TfNSW 2020, p. 17; VIC DTP 2023b, p. 6; VicRoads 2017).\nReducing overly restrictive standards and specifications could provide access to lower cost, better\nperforming and more sustainable materials for infrastructure. These benefits could be significant. In the next\nfour years alone, investment in future public infrastructure is expected to total $270 billion (IPA 2024,\npp. 2–3), and efficient net zero transition policy developments are likely to present opportunities for less\nemissions intensive construction materials.6 Reducing overly restrictive standards and specifications could\nalso help achieve government objectives related to sustainable procurement, particularly those that prioritise\nthe use of recycled materials and the reduction of embodied carbon in infrastructure (for example,\nDCCEEW 2024f; Infrastructure NSW 2024; VIC DTP 2024b; WA DoT 2024b).\nHowever, moving too hastily to performance-based standards and specifications, or harmonisation without\nbetter information on the purpose and details of each standard and specification, could have unintended\nconsequences and result in worse overall outcomes. For example, prescriptive standards and specifications\ncan have lower compliance and enforcement costs, and lower risks for contractors (Coglianese 2017,\npp. 22–30; Thomson 2014, p. 6). Participants noted that prescriptive standards and specifications can also\nprovide industry with certainty and ensure a benchmark level of quality without rigorous testing requirements.\nWhile greater harmonisation can reduce compliance costs, participants emphasised that it may also make\nupdating standards and specifications more cumbersome. Changing standards and specifications without\nfirst identifying high-impact areas may also lead to efforts being focused on materials or asset classes with\nlimited potential to tangibly improve environmental outcomes.\nThere is currently no definitive or consistent position on which specific standards or specifications are too\nconservative or outdated, and where changes will have the biggest impact. Several participants noted that\nwhile governments had made some progress, the large number of standards and specifications makes it\ndifficult for them to provide meaningful advice on what needs changing.

Contractors and asset owners are sometimes unaware\nof the sustainable alternative materials available and can have misconceptions about their quality or performance.\nThey also tend to lack confidence in the strength, durability and quality of sustainable materials, and rely on\nfamiliar materials to avoid unnecessary risk and focus on other delivery objectives (such as quality or speed) (for\nexample, ACOR, sub. 75, p. 27; APCC, sub. 74, p. 3; CCAA, sub. 55, p. 18).\nExisting government information and support services such as circular design guidelines and knowledge\nhubs are often insufficient to address these knowledge and skills gaps among suppliers, contractors and\nasset owners. For example, overcoming stakeholder concerns about using sustainable materials requires\nhands on, ongoing expert advice to work through regulatory and technical obstacles, or knowledge gaps\nabout where to procure sustainable materials in specific projects.\nIn Victoria, the government is addressing these concerns through the ecologiQ program. EcologiQ is an\nongoing program which works with suppliers, contractors and asset owners of major infrastructure projects to\nencourage uptake and optimise the use of recycled materials (VIC DTP 2023a). Its activities include helping\nbusinesses to overcome prescriptive or conservative technical specifications and working with departments\nand standards bodies to draft new standards.\nThe ecologiQ program is often cited as a leading example in providing personnel-based, tailored information\nand support services to build industry confidence in procuring sustainable materials (for example, ACOR,\nsub. 75, p. 29; Arup, sub. 52, p. 6; Australasian Railway Association, sub. 97, p. 5). For example, ecologiQ\nteams were instrumental in working with asset owners and specification bodies to develop a specification for\nthe use of recycled plastic in freeway noise walls, which resulted in the development of a new national\nAustroads technical specification, and the use of more than 570 tonnes of wasted household plastic for the\nMordialloc freeway (Austroads 2023; Sustainability Victoria 2022). The Australian Council of Recycling noted\nthat the ecologiQ program has been ‘critical to building capability and confidence in procurement of\nsustainable and recycled materials’ (sub. 75, p. 29). Through delivery of the Recycled First policy, ecologiQ\nhas incorporated approximately 3.4 million tonnes of recycled materials in major public infrastructure since its\ninception in 2019 (VIC DTP 2025a). The benefits of this type of model include the ability to accumulate and\ntransfer learning from project to project and better understand stakeholder concerns.\nFacilitation services, such as those provided by the ecologiQ program, are likely to be beneficial to other\njurisdictions with commitments to major infrastructure projects. Challenges such as changing industry\nattitudes and filling knowledge gaps affect many novel or innovative sustainable practices, products or\nmaterials being used (such as low-carbon cement mixes or alternatives), not just recycled materials.\nAllocating even a very small proportion of the billions of dollars in public funding spent on public\ninfrastructure to dedicated support services could help increase uptake of sustainable materials and\npractices, with economic and/or environmental benefits.\nState and territory governments with commitments to major infrastructure projects should introduce or\nexpand support services whereby dedicated facilitators work with suppliers, contractors and asset owners to:\n• educate them about the use of sustainable materials in infrastructure, including addressing misplaced\nconcerns about using sustainable materials and highlighting opportunities to use sustainable materials\n• overcome regulatory or technical obstacles to using sustainable materials in specific projects\n• connect suppliers of sustainable materials or products with potential customers (such as contractors and\nasset owners).\nState and territory governments could tailor the scale and scope of these services to their own context\nincluding environmental objectives, projected infrastructure expenditure, recycling infrastructure and access\n45", "text_len": 4398, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For example, greater conversion of food and agricultural wastes\ninto natural fertilisers, biochar (box 3.2) or compost helps to develop the pathway for similar reprocessing of\nother organic materials such as wastewater biosolids managed by the urban water sector1 and household\nwaste (and vice versa).\n1 AWA (sub. 23, p. 1); Logan City Council (sub. 61, p. 2); qldWater (sub. 51, p. 2); Urban Utilities (sub. 71, p. 3).\n47\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  |  | \n | Key points |  | \n |  |  | \n |  | Greater adoption of circular principles in the management of food, agriculture and organics could | \n |  | increase materials productivity and bring about economic, social and environmental benefits. | \n |  | • Food production, packaging and distribution in Australia uses 215 million tonnes of raw materials annually, and | \n |  | Australian businesses and households waste more than 14 million tonnes of organic materials each year. | \n |  | • Reducing regulatory uncertainty for businesses seeking to produce, market or use products derived from | \n |  | wasted organic materials (that is, secondary organic materials, such as biochar) could increase materials | \n |  | productivity by diverting organic materials from landfill for productive uses. | \n |  |  | \n |  | After examining opportunities for circularity across the food and organics life cycle, and considering | \n |  | government policies already underway, the Productivity Commission is recommending further | \n |  | streamlining of state and territory regulations relating to organic materials reuse. | \n |  | • To help realise the economic and environmental benefits from reusing wasted organic materials, state and | \n |  | territory governments should develop dedicated regulatory pathways that outline the requirements for organic | \n |  | waste to transition into saleable materials, beginning with biochar. | \n |  | • As a complementary measure, state and territory governments should change energy from waste regulations | \n |  | to distinguish between processes such as gasification and pyrolysis to produce biochar and conventional | \n |  | energy from waste processes (such as incineration), where this has not already been done. | \n |  |  | ", "text_len": 4569, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The use of organic compost has been associated with improved soil health\nthrough increased microbial biomass and nutrient cycling, and improved soil structure (Larsen et al. 2022, p. 8).\nAnd the application of biochar to soils or as a livestock feed supplement has been associated with improved\nagricultural outcomes (Howell et al. 2023, pp. 152–153; Man et al. 2021, p. 208). Organics reprocessing also has\nbroader benefits such as greenhouse gas emissions reductions. For example, converting organic materials to\nbiochar and applying it to soil helps store the carbon of its organic inputs, avoiding the emissions that would\notherwise enter the atmosphere during decomposition (Joseph et al. 2021, p. 3).\nThe food system and natural resources\nFood production relies on natural resources, including land and water, and their associated ecosystem\nservices and biodiversity. Approximately half of Australia’s land area is used for agricultural production\n(ABS 2018), and the agriculture industry accounts for the majority of Australia’s water consumption\n(BoM 2021, p. 44).\nFood production can result in negative environmental impacts including the degradation of natural resources\nand ecosystem services such as water purification, nutrient cycling and pollination (Williams et al. 2021,\np. 23). For example, prolonged fertiliser and pesticide use, where not well managed, can increase soil\nacidity, reduce the availability of plant nutrients and harm soil organisms and useful bacteria (Agriculture\nVictoria 2024). In Australia, regional natural resource management organisations work with people (including\nprimary producers) and communities to take an integrated, landscape scale approach to managing land,\nwater, soils and ecosystems. This approach regenerates and sustains productive landscapes and\nbiodiversity (NRM Regions Australia 2025). Other innovations, such as precision agriculture techniques,\nhave also reduced the unintended environmental impacts of some farming methods (Whelan 2019).\nSome types of food production are also emissions intensive. Activity in the food and agriculture sector\ncollectively contributed 11% of Australia’s direct (scope 1) emissions2 in 2023 (PC estimates, based on\nDCCEEW 2025b). Agriculture alone contributes more than half of Australia’s total methane emissions each\nyear (Hughes et al. 2024, p. 10), three quarters of which are ruminant emissions from livestock (CCA 2023,\np. 9). Wasted organics3 in landfills, approximately 75% of which is food and garden waste\n(DCCEEW 2021b), contributes about 2.5% of Australia’s total emissions annually (DCCEEW 2025e).\nThe costs of food waste\nFood waste occurs at all stages of the food product life cycle, including production, distribution, retail and\nconsumption. Food waste includes both edible waste (food produced for human consumption but disposed\nof without consumption) and inedible food waste (such as seeds, bones, skins and peels) (DEE 2017, p. 8).\nApproximately 70% of Australia’s food waste is edible food (FIAL 2021, p. 14). Australians collectively waste\nabout 7.6 million tonnes of food each year, led by households (32%) and primary producers (22%) (PC\nestimates, based on FIAL 2021, p. 12), costing the economy almost $37 billion annually (FIAL 2021, p. 18).\n2 This includes direct emissions from the agriculture; aquaculture; forestry and logging; fishing, hunting and trapping;\nagriculture, forestry and fishing support services; and food, beverage and tobacco manufacturing subsectors. It does not\ninclude an adjustment for forest and wood product stocks, or account for other organics related emissions.\n3 Organic waste includes food and agricultural waste as well as timber waste and biosolids (DCCEEW 2025c, p. 45).\n48", "text_len": 3957, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The food system requires a significant volume of materials, particularly\nbiomass (organic materials from plants and animals such as seeds, fertilisers and pasture). In the 2023-24\nfinancial year, Australia’s food and agriculture sector4 accounted for about 9% of total Australian industry\noutput (PC estimates, based on ABS 2025a). In the same period, about 2.4 million people (18% of the\nAustralian workforce) were employed in food and agriculture jobs (PC estimates, based on ABS 2025a). The\nCSIRO estimates that the Australian food provision system accounts for 22% of materials used in Australia\n(215 million tonnes) (PC estimates, based on Miatto et al. 2024, p. 19). Consequently, even small materials\nproductivity improvements could generate large economic and environmental benefits.\nIn the interim report, the Productivity Commission considered a range of opportunities for government action\nto increase circularity in the food and agriculture sector (figure 3.1). Some of these opportunities were:\n• sustainable agriculture and natural resource management practices, both on individual farms and at\nlandscape scales, which can reduce the materials intensity of agricultural production\n• redirecting more surplus, edible food from waste for consumption\n• advanced food barcode labelling, including origin and expiration information, which can reduce food\nwasted by retailers and distributors because of distribution inefficiencies\n• advertising and labelling schemes which can raise awareness and knowledge among households about\nhow to sort waste to reduce contamination and improve the recyclability of organic waste streams\n• better accounting for the emissions reduction benefits of using biomethane in national carbon reporting\nrules, which could incentivise anaerobic digestion projects using residual organic materials.\nIn many cases, governments have taken, and are continuing to take, actions that facilitate the uptake of\nthese (and other) opportunities. For example, several government policies have recently been introduced to\nreduce Australia’s food waste throughout the product life cycle (box 3.1). A wider range of natural resource\nmanagement and sustainable agriculture opportunities are outside the scope of this inquiry, but some of\nthese could be supported by the place-based initiatives proposed in chapter 7.\nAfter assessing opportunities against several considerations (chapter 1), the PC is recommending\nstreamlining state and territory regulations to help realise the economic and environmental benefits from\nreusing wasted organic materials.\nSince the interim report, the Australian Government has progressed changes to better account for the\nemissions reduction benefits of substituting natural gas for biomethane derived from the anaerobic digestion of\norganic materials.5 The Australian Government’s National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement)\nAmendment (2025 Update) Determination 2025 (Cth) addresses the potential accounting gaps identified in the\ninterim report.6 In particular, the amendments now recognise renewable gas certificates, awarded for\nbiomethane consumption, as evidence of abated emissions for Safeguard Mechanism or National Greenhouse\n4 The food and agriculture sector includes non-forestry agriculture subsectors and food manufacturing, wholesaling and\nretailing subsectors. Compared to other sectors discussed in this report, the inclusion of wholesaling and retailing\ncontributions may increase the estimated economic size of the sector. However, as these are important stages of the\nfood life cycle, they have been included. This estimate also does not capture the value of the broader organics sector,\nwhich provides essential services (such as wastewater management) that underpin public health and wellbeing.\n5 Biomethane is a net zero energy source, as combusting biomethane only releases the carbon absorbed by the organic\nmaterial from which it was derived (CER 2022a, p. 7).\n6 The amendments are enacted by inserting section 2.67C into the National Greenhouse Energy Reporting\n(Measurement) Determination 2008 (Cth).\n49", "text_len": 4305, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This strategy should\nidentify where and in what quantity agricultural commodities are grown and distributed, and where there are\nopportunities to reduce food waste.7 This information would enable the strategy to include social and\nenvironmental goals of the food system, such as reducing food waste and aspects of food insecurity.

Organic waste in landfill is estimated to release 13 million tonnes of carbon dioxide\nequivalent emissions annually, or 2.5% of Australia’s total emissions (DCCEEW 2025e).\nThe productive life of residual organic materials can be extended by using them to produce organic fertilisers\nand products such as biochar (box 3.2). Diverting these materials from landfill, transforming them into\ncarbon-stable products and substituting them for synthetic alternative materials not only avoids the\ngreenhouse gas emissions associated with organic material decomposition, but also creates broader\nenvironmental benefits. For example, the use of organics-derived materials has been shown to help improve\nsoil chemistry and nutrient bioavailability, and reduce the negative effects of synthetic materials use, such as\nnitrogen run-off (Larsen et al. 2022, p. 8; Wei et al. 2021, p. 7).\nBox 3.2 – Biochar as an alternative to sending organic materials to landfill\nAlthough some production methods of biochar are relatively new, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\npeople have used biochar for thousands of years to promote soil health, improve crop growth and\nmitigate the risk of bushfires. Biochar is a carbon-rich, charcoal-like solid that can be used as a feed\nsupplement, alternative fertiliser or construction material, and has been associated with improved\nagricultural outcomes (Chowdhury et al. 2025, pp. 14, 16; Man et al. 2021, p. 208). Agricultural waste,\ncrop residues, animal waste, biosolids in wastewater sludge, and digestate (a solid by-product from\nanaerobic digestion) can all be transformed into biochar through advanced processing methods such as\npyrolysis or gasification (Amalina et al. 2022, p. 1). Biochar also stores much of the carbon of its organic\ninputs, avoiding the emissions that would otherwise arise as the organic material decomposes (Lehmann\net al. 2006, p. 405).\n8 These effects would be even more pronounced if not for existing efforts from households, businesses and governments\nto recover wasted organics. Over 60% of the 14.6 million tonnes of organic waste produced in Australia in the 2022-23\nfinancial year was recovered for composting, fertilisers and energy production (DCCEEW 2025c, p. 45).\n9 Biosolids are a mix of the water and organic materials leftover from the sewage treatment process. Biosolids can\ncontain valuable macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and sulphur, but can also contain hazardous\ncontaminants such as arsenic, mercury and selenium (ANZBP 2016, p. 1).\n52\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | \n | Box 3.2 – Biochar as an alternative to sending organic materials to landfill | \n |  | \n | Although some production methods of biochar are relatively new, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander | \n | people have used biochar for thousands of years to promote soil health, improve crop growth and | \n | mitigate the risk of bushfires.

While some governments have developed\ncodes for some materials (such as biosolids and digestate), only Queensland has developed a code for\nbiochar, finalised in May 2025 (QLD DETSI 2025). Investors and industry groups have indicated this lack of\na clear regulatory pathway has created substantial uncertainty for users and investors and stifled the uptake\nof biochar opportunities in particular.12 Pyrocal (sub. 209, p. 2) noted, in the case of Logan City’s biosolids\ngasification plant, the lack of specific regulation governing when biochar can be applied to land had also\nprevented the generation of economic returns to existing investment in biochar.\nIn addition, biochar production can also be stifled by policies that restrict thermal treatments of waste for\nenergy recovery, because some types of thermal treatment processes (such as pyrolysis and gasification)\nare those that can be used to also generate biochar. The objective of these policies is typically to incentivise\nbusinesses to reuse materials for, alternative, higher value purposes, rather than disposing of and treating\nwaste to generate energy only. For example, in the Australian Capital Territory, all thermal processes for\ntreating waste are banned (ACT TCCS 2020, p. 9). Similarly in Greater Sydney, thermal treatment of some\nwasted organics, including for the production of secondary materials, is not permitted (NSW DPHI 2025).13\nHowever, by restricting processes such as pyrolysis and gasification, these effective bans also restrict or\nprevent the production of biochar. As noted, biochar has broader economic and environmental benefits\nbeyond energy recovery alone, such as improvements to agricultural productivity and carbon sequestration\n(box 3.2). In recognition of these benefits, Victoria, for example, has already instituted exemptions from\nwaste to energy production caps for ‘thermal pyrolysis process[es] to sequester carbon’ (VIC DELWP 2021,\np. 13), which includes biochar production. An international study also demonstrated that using pyrolysis to\ncreate biochar produces emissions which are simpler to control compared to conventional energy from waste\nmethodologies, such as incineration (Flatabø et al. 2023, p. 11). By classifying all ‘thermal’ treatments of\n10 A secondary material is a material which has been used once before, recovered and reprocessed for subsequent use\n(Circle Economy 2025, p. 65).\n11 For example, risks such as the contamination of groundwater, release of bacteria into the atmosphere, or creation of\nodour (VIC EPA 2025b).\n12 ANZBIG (sub. 173, p. 44); Jemena (sub. 250, p. 5); Pyrocal (sub. 209, p. 2); WMRR (sub. 168, p. 7); WRAP (sub. 230, p. 11).\n13 Some exceptions to these restrictions exist in Greater Sydney, including for the thermal treatment of contaminated soils or\nbiosolids. The first overarching principle used by the NSW Environment Protection Authority to assess proposals to thermally\ntreat waste for energy recovery is that ‘higher value resource recovery outcomes are maximised’ (NSW EPA 2023).\n53", "text_len": 4462, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

These pathways could be established through, for\nexample, guidelines, an end of waste code or a resource recovery order and exemption (depending on the\nexisting regulatory architecture in each jurisdiction). In turn, this would unlock the potential of these materials\nwhile managing the risks of their production and use.\nTo complement these pathways and accommodate the production of secondary organic materials where it is\neconomically feasible, state and territory governments should amend energy from waste regulations to\ndistinguish processes such as pyrolysis and gasification to produce biochar from traditional energy from\nwaste processes (such as incineration) to recognise the circular benefits of the former, where this distinction\nis not already made. This would be in line with the European Union’s Best Available Techniques Reference\nDocument for Waste Incineration, which notes that pyrolysis and gasification can be used to recover both the\nenergetic and chemical value of waste (including its chemical properties), unlike combustion which can\nrecover only the energetic value (Neuwahl et al. 2019, p. 57). As discussed, some jurisdictions have already\ninstituted these distinctions. These regulations should be harmonised between different jurisdictions as far as\npracticable. Governance arrangements which facilitate harmonised circular economy regulations are\ndiscussed in chapter 7.\nBiochar is a priority material for the development of dedicated regulatory pathways given its particular\nagricultural and environmental benefits when used, and its scope for increased production in Australia.\nAccording to the Australia New Zealand Biochar Industry Group, Australia has an annual biochar production\npotential of up to 30 million tonnes by 2050 (Rebbeck et al. 2022, p. 6), up from a domestic production of\napproximately 20,000 tonnes in 2020 (ANZBIG 2023, p. 8). Though the Emissions Reduction Assurance\nCommittee (ERAC) has not prioritised developing a proposed biochar production Australian Carbon Credit\nUnit (ACCU) method,15 it did note there was a large and diverse range of potential feedstocks for biochar\nproduction which represented a large carbon abatement opportunity (DCCEEW 2024j, p. 18). A 2023 South\nAustralian parliamentary inquiry into biochar also recognised the benefits of greater regulatory clarity,\n14 This recovery is consistent with targets three and six of the National Waste Policy Action Plan 2024 (DCCEEW 2024h,\npp. 9, 12): to increase the resource recovery rate from all waste streams to an average of 80% and to halve the amount\nof organic waste sent to landfill by 2030, respectively.\n15 The Australian Government Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment, and Water (DCCEEW) is\nimplementing a new proponent-led process for developing and modifying ACCU methods, which was recommended by a\n2022 Independent Review of the ACCU scheme (Chubb et al. 2022, p. 10). While the Australian Government progresses\nlegislative reforms to implement the review’s recommendations, there is an interim process whereby proponents put\nforward method expressions of interest to the ERAC for inclusion in the scheme. The ERAC then uses triage criteria\n(including scale, complexity, innovation, co-benefits and adverse impacts) to inform their recommendations to the\nMinister about which expressions of interest should be prioritised for method development (ERAC 2024, p. 5).\n54", "text_len": 4369, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This trade-off arises because regulations that ensure materials derived from wasted organic\nmaterials meet certain quality standards increase production costs and therefore reduce the feasibility of\nopportunities to repurpose wasted organic materials (ACOR, sub. 75, p. 19; Hunter Joint Organisation, sub.\n172, p. 13; Pyrocal, sub. 209, p. 2). Some participants noted concerns that preliminary efforts to create a\ndedicated process for biochar use in Queensland16 resulted in regulations that are overly cautious.\n• Jemena (sub. 250, p. 5), a renewable energy producer, noted that the end of waste code for digestate (a\nby-product of anaerobic digestion and common source of biochar) requires digestate to have lower levels\nof contaminants (including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) than would be present in the general\nenvironment before it can be used as an input. They describe this regulation as ‘unnecessarily strict’.\n• Pyrocal (sub. 209, p. 2), a biochar production engineering firm, noted the end of waste code for biochar\nwould require producers to undertake testing for contaminants that would cost approximately\n$130,000 per year, resulting in reduced uptake of the production technology.\nIn assessing the suitability of contamination thresholds and broader production licensing arrangements for\nsecondary organic material production and marketability, governments should ensure that regulation\ngoverning the recovery of organic waste, like all government regulation, does not unnecessarily inhibit\ninnovation nor constrain the productivity of these materials. Robust and transparent regulatory approaches,\nin line with the principle of regulatory stewardship (chapter 7), provide greater certainty for investment in\norganic waste processing technology and facilitate the uptake of circular opportunities.\nIn addition to dedicated regulatory pathways, governments could also support the uptake of biochar and\nother organic waste derived materials opportunities by continuing to evaluate regulations for both existing\nand emerging contaminants of feedstock. Some inquiry participants17 suggested that reforms to prevent\nchemicals of concern from entering products and waste streams in the first place should also be considered\nas a means of facilitating the recovery of value from wasted organic materials. Approaches to dealing with\nchemicals of concern are discussed further in chapter 8.\nSome participants also suggested that additional supports for the separation of organic waste from other\nwaste at its source would reduce contamination and incentivise organic material recovery and valorisation in\nways that return nutrients to soils (GISA, sub. 245, p. 3; Veolia Australia and New Zealand, sub. 193, p. 3).\nSource separation of organic waste is already incentivised through the NGER legislation, where segregating\norganic waste for composting, anaerobic digestion or fuel production is recognised as emissions abatement\n(CER 2024b). Up to January 2022, only 13 projects had been registered under the method and collectively\nclaimed just under 7,000 ACCUs (CER 2022b, p. 1). As noted by one inquiry participant, this relatively low\nuptake could be caused by the complexity of the measurement requirements under this method (GISA,\nsub. 245, p. 2). The source separation of organic waste ACCU method is currently under review by\nDCCEEW (DCCEEW 2025h). This review will consider the sufficiency of the method in promoting source\nseparation of organic waste and should also include consideration of whether the complexity of\nmeasurement requirements is a barrier to higher uptake.\n16 The Queensland Government finalised the biochar end of waste code after submissions to this inquiry had closed.\n17 ACOR (sub. 256, pp. 12-13); LGAQ (sub. 244, p. 6); qldWater (sub. 51, p. 4); Veolia Australia and New Zealand\n(sub. 8, p. 2); WARRRL (sub. 87, p. 11); WMRR (sub. 168, p. 6); ZWV (sub. 169, p. 4).\n55", "text_len": 4451, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Mining involves exploration and planning, extraction, sorting and basic processing (such as\ngrinding and washing). This report has not examined circular opportunities in more advanced mineral\nprocessing. Due to its role in extracting raw materials, the mining sector has supply chain links with many\nother sectors, such as the built environment (chapter 2). Enhancing circular practices and improving\nmaterials productivity in mining can therefore have flow-on impacts to other sectors.\nEnvironmental impacts associated with materials mining\nDeveloping and operating mine sites can significantly disturb lands and waterways, resulting in air and water\npollution, biodiversity loss and soil erosion, which can in turn negatively affect human health, and social and\ncultural connections to the land (Leyton-Flor and Sangha 2024, p. 2). These impacts can remain long after a mine\ncloses. Australia has over 50,000 abandoned mines (Salmi et al. 2022, p. 6). Many of these pose contamination\nrisks because they operated before regulators introduced modern environmental and safety practices (Abraham\net al. 2018, p. 123). Even modern mines that are subject to stricter environmental management can continue to\nhave long-term impacts on the landscape. For example, a 2017 research paper found fewer than 30 examples of\nfully rehabilitated and relinquished mines across Australia (Campbell et al. 2017, p. 10).\nMining activities produce various residues such as overburden (soil and rock removed to access the desired\ncommodity), waste rock and tailings (fine particle residue left after the desired materials are removed during\nprocessing). In 2020-21, the mining sector produced 620 million tonnes of wasted materials, which was more\nthan four times the wasted materials of all other sectors combined (DCCEEW 2022a, p. 17). If mining\ncompanies do not properly manage tailings and other residues, or if there is a failure in tailings storage\nfacilities (TSFs), contaminants can negatively affect water quality, surrounding soils, and the air (Salmi et\nal. 2022, p. 11; University of Melbourne, sub. 36, p. 8).\nOpportunities for greater circularity in mining\nIn the interim report the Productivity Commission identified a range of circular economy opportunities across\nthe mining life cycle that are applicable in an Australian context (figure 4.1):\n• minimising generation of wasted materials through lower-impact and precision techniques that enhance\nthe precision of exploration and selectivity of extraction (CSIRO 2017, pp. 47–48, 2023, pp. 12–13)\n• life-extension and reuse of mining equipment through maintenance and refurbishment\n• recovering mineral resources, such as critical and strategic minerals, from mining residues\n• recycling mineral residues into products such as silica-sand products (ore-sand), low-carbon geopolymer\nconcrete, mineral fertilisers, or for backfilling and road construction (Golev et al. 2022, p. 4; MRIWA 2024)\n• repurposing mining tailings for carbon capture through mineral carbonation\n• reducing and recycling non-mineral materials that have been wasted, such as plastic packaging\n• repurposing of post-mining land and infrastructure through alternative post-mining land uses.\nAfter assessing opportunities against several considerations (chapter 1), the PC is recommending government\nactions to facilitate repurposing post-mining land, infrastructure and residues. Circular economy opportunities in\nmining residues and post-mining land uses appear to have significant potential to increase materials productivity,\nwith scope to grow due to their lower rates of adoption. As discussed below, there are also potential impediments\nto adopting these activities arising from current regulations, which governments could address.\n58", "text_len": 4009, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Moreover, these practices are already relatively widespread in Australia, as\nefficiency improvements are often aligned with commercial incentives (MCA, sub. 269, p. 4).\nInquiry participants have suggested that a ban on in-pit burial of off-the-road tyres be implemented to\nincrease the recovery rates of off-the-road tyres (ATRA, sub. 227, p. 5; Tyrecycle, sub. 261, p. 2).

Current challenges include managing the environmental\nand economic impacts of current and historic mining practices, which can persist long after mine sites have\nclosed (Beer et al. 2022, p. 9), as well as realising the value from left over mining materials and by-products.\nThese challenges are significant in Australia given it is home to over 2,200 active mines and over 50,000\nclosed and abandoned mine sites (CSIRO 2023, p. 2; Salmi et al. 2022, p. 9).\nAn emerging challenge is managing socioeconomic and environmental transitions in regions significantly\nimpacted by mine closures. Around 240 Australian mines are expected to end their economically productive\nlife between 2021 and 2040, with most of these closures concentrated in Western Australia, Queensland and\nNew South Wales (CSIRO 2023, pp. 2, 55). Mine closures can have major economic and social impacts on\nthe surrounding communities and broader regions (Sinclair et al. 2022, p. v). Many regional areas in\nAustralia are highly reliant on mines for employment. In 2024, 45% of the mining workforce was in regional\nor remote Australia (AUSMASA 2025). Mining also generates local business activity (such as food,\naccommodation and healthcare services), which in turn support the local economy and enhance the quality\nof life for residents (Blackwell et al. 2017, pp. 2–3). For example, Resources NSW estimated that coal mining\ncreated 22,000 direct jobs and around 89,000 indirect jobs in New South Wales (2022, p. 4). This means\nwhen mines close, there can be flow on effects to the broader region.\nApplying circular principles to post-mining land, infrastructure and residues could help address both these\nchallenges. Traditionally, when a mine closes, the goal of site rehabilitation is to return it to a safe, stable and\nnon-polluting landform suitable for its pre-mining use (such as agriculture) (enviroMETS QLD 2023, p. 5;\nMCA, sub. 269, p. 6). However, there are opportunities for alternative uses that repurpose elements of\npost-mining land, infrastructure and residues for social, economic and environmental benefit. These\nopportunities vary considerably by site and range from proposals to reprocess mine tailings and other\nresidues to extract remaining minerals and create valuable products, to using mined land to host clean\nenergy projects, recreational or scientific facilities (AMEC, sub. 143, pp. 6-7; Beer et al. 2022, p. 21; CRC\n2 Project findings were provided to Australian Environment Ministers at their 10 December 2024 meeting, along with an\nundertaking to release two reports in 2025, which detailed the project’s research and findings.\n60", "text_len": 4127, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The former mine site is in the process of\nbeing transformed into a motor park and tourist destination, and the NSW Government has indicated that this\nwill create more than 450 jobs during construction, 229 permanent roles and generate ongoing economic\nactivity through tourism (Houssos 2024).\nDespite the potential benefits, there are only a handful of Australian examples of mining companies or third\nparties repurposing closed mine sites for alternative social or economic uses (AMEC, sub. 143, pp. 6-7; Beer\net al. 2022, p. 21; CSIRO 2023, p. 38). The small number of successful examples of repurposing reflects the\nbarriers that exist, in particular the limitations of existing regulatory and planning processes.\nHow governments should facilitate repurposing post-mining assets\nDevelop land transition plans for affected regions\nTo facilitate post-mining land uses that benefit and are aligned with local community needs, state and\nterritory governments should develop land transition plans for regions and communities that are\nexperiencing, or are soon to experience, significant transitions away from mining. State and territory\ngovernments should assess the mined land, infrastructure and residues that will become available as mines\nclose, and develop plans that establish priority future beneficial uses for them, informed by a collaborative\nplanning approach in partnership with communities and aligned with existing regional plans.\nCurrent approaches to mine transition are usually site-focused and proponent-led (CRC TiME, sub. 224, p. 7).\nHowever, impacts of mine closure are felt regionally, particularly where mine closures are concentrated in one\narea. For example, it is predicted that decarbonisation and the rollout of alternative energy sources will lead to\nextensive coal mine closures, which will have significant impacts for certain regions (Wood et al. 2022, pp. 44–\n45). In Australia, coal mines are heavily concentrated in the Mackay region (Bowen Basin, Queensland) and in\nthe Hunter Valley and surrounding areas (Sydney Basin, New South Wales) (Geoscience Australia 2025b).\nThere are also locally important coal mining operations in Collie (Western Australia) and the Latrobe Valley\n(Victoria) (Geoscience Australia 2025b). In New South Wales, it is expected that by 2040 most of the state’s\ncoal mines will be closed, which will have significant impacts for the Hunter region (Department of Regional\nNSW 2024). Collie and the Latrobe Valley are also experiencing significant coal mine closures (Government of\nWestern Australia 2023a, p. 1, 2023b, p. 1; State Government of Victoria 2020, p. 3). An uncoordinated\napproach to mine closure and transition risks not producing the best environmental, social and economic\nresults for the local region (Hunter Renewal, sub. 206 attachment, pp. 12–13).\nState and territory governments should develop land transition plans through a collaborative regional\nplanning process that partners with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, community members and\nlocal governments to determine priority uses for post-mining land, infrastructure and residues. A regional\napproach allows the selection of priority land uses for sites to be informed by broader regional needs and the\nsites’ comparative advantages. For example, some sites will have characteristics that make them relatively\nmore suited to future industrial uses, such as renewable energy generation or municipal waste recovery.\nSuch characteristics include established infrastructure, access to electricity and transport networks, access\nto suitable workforces and specific landform features (NSWMC, sub. 200, p. 2; State Development\nCommittee 2025, pp. 105–106; WMRR, sub. 233, p. 10). Other sites may have characteristics that make\nthem relatively more suited to biodiversity and conservation activities, such as location in a potential\nbiodiversity corridor or having unmined buffer lands or rehabilitated areas that have significant biodiversity\nvalue (State Development Committee 2024, p. 20). Certain areas may have Indigenous Land Use\nAgreements in place, whose agreed outcomes should be reflected in transition plans.\n61", "text_len": 4337, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Reflecting the products of this\nengagement transparently in public planning documents, should give communities confidence that their\npriorities are being considered in the decisions made by mining companies, and also by regulators when\napproving alternative post-mining land uses. One potential model for this is in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley,\nwhere state government, local government and the community are guiding post-mining land use planning, as\npart of broader regional development planning and investment. The collaborative planning process is being\nsupported by the Cooperative Research Centre for Transformations in Mining Economies. It proposes future\nland use options for post-mining lands that are supported by key stakeholders and address a range of\ncommunity benefits, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s aspirations. The project\nincorporates existing regional strategies and plans, aiming to support broader regional economic\ndevelopment (CRC TiME 2024a; Haque et al. 2024).\nWhile collaborative planning in the Latrobe Valley occurred in response to imminent mine closures, there are\nbenefits to developing regional transition plans well before mine closures occur. Establishing regional plans\nearly creates greater certainty for mine operators and potential developers looking to invest in alternative\npost-mining land uses, given that the approval process for changing post-mining land uses can be lengthy\nand the outcome is uncertain. Regional plans should promote the shared responsibility of mining operators\nfor post-mining transitions by guiding their activities before closure, including shaping their financial\ncontributions to any industry or government-managed regional development funds. Establishing priority land\nuses should enable mining companies to adjust their mine closure plans early and tailor any progressive\nrehabilitation activities towards known goals. This also benefits mining operators by reducing the risk that\nconsiderable resources are expended on rehabilitation activities, which are then potentially disturbed by new\ndevelopment or that potentially valuable infrastructure is removed (NSWMC, sub. 200, p. 23). It may also\nfacilitate the progressive realisation of opportunities during the life of a mining operation. For example, the\nStawell Underground Physics Lab in Victoria reuses mining infrastructure in a closed portion of an operating\nmine (CRC TiME, sub. 224, p. 4).\nThe significance of mine closure and transition on a region should be assessed to determine if a transition\nplan will be beneficial. While mining occurs in all states and territories of Australia (Geoscience\nAustralia 2025a),3 as discussed, some states currently have, or will have, areas with higher concentrations of\nmine closures. Also, some mine closures are likely to have greater regional impacts due to factors such as\nlow regional diversification in non-mining economic activities. State and territory governments should\nconsider the social, environmental and economic impacts of mine closure before selecting which regions, if\nany, require land transition planning.\nReview state and territory regulatory frameworks and processes\nTo facilitate the beneficial repurposing of post-mining land, infrastructure and mining residues, state and\nterritory governments should review and amend the regulatory frameworks and processes that guide mine\nclosure and transition. The review should include relevant provisions in mining, environmental, land\nmanagement, planning and health and safety legislation, and associated regulations and policies. The\nreview should consider:\n• making regulatory pathways for modifying agreed post-mining land uses clearer and more streamlined, to\nfacilitate innovative post-mining land uses and multiple successive land uses\n3 There is no mining in the Australian Capital Territory apart from quarries used for construction materials.\n62", "text_len": 4158, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For example,\nensuring that goal and objective-setting for these regulatory reform processes is undertaken in partnership\nwith and reflects the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Amendments to\napproval processes should maintain or improve requirements to partner and engage with Aboriginal and\nTorres Strait Islander communities.\nEnvironmental regulation, planning and approval processes are necessary to keep mining companies\naccountable for managing mining residues, mine rehabilitation and closure in an environmentally responsible\nand safe manner. However, they can add unnecessary compliance burden if they are overly restrictive (for\nexample, not risk-based) or do not evolve with changing circumstances. Regulatory burdens and the\nassociated delays can negatively impact the commercial value of former mine sites and their assets,\nreducing their competitive advantage over other unmined sites (NSWMC, sub. 200, p. 7). The opportunities\ncreated through regulatory reform could be significant, for example, enviroMETS (sub. 208, p. 3) estimates\nthat ‘regulatory reform could unlock 20–40 viable PMLU [post mining land use] and reprocessing projects\nacross Queensland within 5 years’.\nThe rehabilitation objectives that define a post-mining land use are typically agreed upfront as part of the\nmining project’s development and environmental approvals (Cooper et al. 2024, p. 1225). Mining lease\nholders are also required to provide a draft mine closure and/or rehabilitation plan prior to commencing\noperations (Hamblin et al. 2022, p. 29). Traditionally, governments and regulators have preferred mining\ncompanies return land to its pre-mining state following mine closure (CRC TiME 2024b, p. 4). Establishing\nrehabilitation objectives upfront is necessary to provide protections against future environmental and safety\nrisks. However, it also means that the objectives are set many years before a mine closes, so may not\nrepresent the greatest benefit to the community at the point of mine closure. In fact, they may be in conflict\nwith beneficial post-mining land uses and can result in mining operators removing potentially valuable mine\nassets, such as infrastructure, as part of the mine closure process (Cooper et al. 2024, p. 1225; CRC\nTiME 2024b, p. 4).\nThe process for altering approvals to allow for an alternative post-mining land use is often complex and\ntime-consuming, which acts as a deterrent to pursuing alternative land uses (State Development\nCommittee 2025, pp. 22–23). Regulations that affect repurposing of existing mines include mining lease\nconditions, state and potentially Australian Government environmental approvals, along with related land use\nagreements with Traditional Owners (MCA, sub. 269, p. 6). Changing the agreed post-mining land use\ntherefore requires many separate but interlinked approvals under different pieces of legislation, which are the\nresponsibility of different government departments (NSWMC, sub. 200, p. 8-10).\nMining operators may also be disincentivised from considering alternative post-mining land uses as mining\nlease arrangements result in them taking on new risks when accommodating alternative uses (enviroMETS\nQLD 2023, p. 8; Kragt and Manero 2021, p. 4). For example, in New South Wales, the mine operator must\ncontinue to hold the mining lease until the new development (alternative post-mining land use) is finalised\nand the rehabilitation of the site is certified by the Resources Regulator as complete. As a result, the mining\noperator continues to be liable for the site and maintains the security deposit for the mining lease while\nworks are being carried out, likely by third parties (NSWMC, sub. 200, p. 3).\n63", "text_len": 4204, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For example, regulatory barriers are limited where the\nreprocessing occurs at an operating mine, where the same operator extracts the primary ore and undertakes\ntailings reprocessing for the same mineral (Albemarle Lithium, sub. 268, p. 8). However, regulations can shift\nlegacy environmental liabilities from previous operators onto new operators when taking over a site to repurpose\nits land or assets, such as reprocessing historic mining residues, affecting the viability of these operations.4 There\nare also restrictions on transporting mining residues which can limit these opportunities, for example in\nQueensland ‘benign waste rock is unable to be used off site as it is considered ‘quarry material’… There are\ninstances where large rocks are imported from overseas for various uses in dam and port construction when local\nmaterials from mines could easily provide resources’ (AMEC, sub. 248, p. 4).\nThere is a risk that increasing regulatory flexibility results in an increase in perverse outcomes, such as\nrehabilitation not being completed in a satisfactory manner. When reviewing and amending the relevant\nregulatory frameworks and processes, consideration should be given to maintaining or improving biodiversity\nand conservation outcomes, to ensure that the benefits associated are not lost when increasing flexibility for\nthe repurposing of post-mining land, infrastructure and residues. Regulators will also have to ensure that\nthey have the appropriate skills and resources available to assess the risks, costs and benefits of innovative\npost-mining land uses.\nPublish renewed national guidance for mine closure and transition\nThe success of the mining industry in Australia depends on its ability to meet community expectations on\nenvironmental, social and governance standards (MCA 2021, p. 3), and post-mining land use is emerging as\na significant social license consideration (CME, sub. 251, p. 2). For industry to ‘gain access to future\nresources it needs to demonstrate that it can effectively manage and close mines with the support of the\ncommunities in which it operates’ (Commonwealth of Australia 2016, p. 1).\nRenewing the national guidance for mine closure and transition,5 would allow the Australian Government to\nestablish current leading practice principles and approaches as well as setting expectations for how mining\ncompanies manage mine closure and transition. National guidance would help inform mining operators and\nstate governments on how to update their policies and practices in line with community expectations and\nglobal expertise. National guidance can build on international guidelines released by the International\nCouncil of Mining and Minerals in their Integrated Mine Closure Good Practice Guide (3rd Edition). These are\nvaluable sources of best practice, but given the breadth of their target audience, they cannot replace\nguidelines that are fine-tuned to the Australian context and that take into account Australia’s institutional and\nregulatory capacity (Beer et al. 2022, p. 14).\nUpdating national guidance is an opportunity for the Australian Government to collate the lessons learned by\nvarious state and territory governments and use them to inform ongoing practices. States and territories\nhave disparate approaches to the management of mine closure which ‘represents an array of perspectives\non how best to balance the range of environmental, economic, and social concerns associated with mine\nclosure’ (CRC TiME 2022, p. 1). Some state and territory governments are exploring options that may better\nfacilitate circular economy opportunities in post-mining land use. They also have existing practices and\nlessons learnt that could be of value to other states, notwithstanding the differences between jurisdictions.\nFor example, in Western Australia, the Land and Public Works Amendment Act 2023 introduced a new land\n4 Albemarle Lithium, sub. 268, p. 8; enviroMETS QLD 2023, p. 9; MCA, sub. 269, p. 6; PC 2020d, p. 230; SA DEM,\nsub. 260, p. 2.\n5 The current national guidance is the Mine Closure Handbook which is part of the Leading Practice Sustainable\nDevelopment Program for the Mining Industry series (Commonwealth of Australia 2016).\n64", "text_len": 4445, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

In New South Wales, a recent parliamentary inquiry was conducted into beneficial and\nproductive post-mining land use, which made a number of recommendations including a review of\npost-mining regulatory frameworks and processes and a comprehensive program of reform of current land\nuses and opportunities for future uses across regions experiencing mining and energy transition (State\nDevelopment Committee 2025, pp. x–xii).\nThe Australian Government should ensure the updated national guidance advises mining operators and\nrelevant government departments on how they should evaluate the environmental, social and economic\nvalues and trade-offs of post-mining land use options (recognising the considerable variability that exists\nbetween different types of mines and materials). For example, the national guidance could include an\nexpectation that mining operators and government departments use contemporary tools to evaluate\nenvironmental, social and economic values, such as natural capital assessment and accounting (where\nfeasible) and identify relevant resources to help them apply those tools.\nThe Australian Government should also ensure the updated national guidance sets clear expectations and\noffers guidance on how mining operators engage and partner with communities to inform decision-making. For\nexample, ensuring engagement, partnerships and planning about future opportunities begins early in the mine’s\nlife cycle and continue to be iterated in response to communities’ changing expectations and needs. The\nguidance should clarify how mining companies should partner with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,\ncommunity members and other groups to determine mine transition outcomes that benefit the community (CRC\nTiME, sub. 224, p. 7). A key element of this includes acknowledging and integrating Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander knowledges and values into plans and enabling shared decision-making.\nThis includes respecting cultural knowledge around sacred sites and protocols (such as the\nBarramundi Dreaming site at Argyle Mine … integrating Indigenous ecological knowledge around\nappropriate species selection and restoration objectives … and incorporating local cultural values\naround both the aesthetic and practical aspects of post-mining land use.

For example, an agreement between the Dja Dja Wurrung\nClans Aboriginal Corporation (DJAARA) and Agnico Eagle, the operator of Fosterville Gold Mine, will enable DJARRA to\ninfluence the environmental elements of current mining operations and remediation work after the mine closes. The\nagreement also facilitates employment, training and business opportunities for Dja Dja Wurrung people (Agnico\nEagle 2024).

Product stewardship provides a potential mechanism to drive\nboth upstream design improvements and downstream recovery systems, especially where other policy tools\nsuch as import standards, landfill levies or export bans are unlikely to be effective on their own.\nBox 5.1 – Product stewardship schemes in Australia\nA product stewardship scheme (PSS) establishes shared responsibility among businesses across the\nsupply chain, including manufacturers, importers and (sometimes) retailers, to manage a product’s\nenvironmental and human health impacts throughout its life cycle (DCCEEW nd; PSCOE nd).\nEach PSS is run by a scheme operator (industry or government), which pools funding from participating\nbusinesses to address the product’s collective impact. This can include establishing collection points for used\nproducts, supporting recycling facilities, running public education campaigns or developing design standards.\nUnder the Recycling and Waste Reduction Act 2020 (Cth), PSSs can be voluntary, co-regulatory or\nmandatory, with government involvement varying based on industry structure and the level of risk\nassociated with the product (Environment and Communications Committee 2025, p. 80; Nous Group 2024).\n• Voluntary PSSs allow businesses to choose whether to participate, without official regulatory oversight\nfrom the government or other body.\n• Mandatory and co-regulatory PSSs require businesses (meeting specified criteria) to participate, with\npenalties for non-compliance.\n– Under a mandatory PSS, government establishes and administers the scheme, setting obligations\nfor all liable parties.\n– Under a co-regulatory PSS, industry administers the scheme, but government oversees compliance.\nMost PSSs in Australia are voluntary (such as schemes for mobile phones, tyres and loose, handheld\nbatteries). At the Commonwealth level, Australia currently has one mandatory PSS (oil) and two\nco-regulatory PSSs (packaging and televisions/computers) (DCCEEW 2024i). All state and territory\ngovernments operate mandatory PSSs for beverage containers. New South Wales has recently\nimplemented the Product Lifecycle Responsibility Act 2025 (NSW), establishing a framework for\nmandatory product stewardship for specific products such as small electronics.\nVoluntary schemes can work well for low-risk products or industries where coordination is easier, while\nmandatory schemes may be needed for high-risk products or fragmented supply chains (Nous Group 2024).\nHowever, a common criticism of voluntary schemes is free riding, which is when businesses benefit from a\nPSS without contributing to its costs (Environment and Communications Committee 2025, p. 82).\nPSSs are particularly valuable because they incentivise manufacturers, importers and retailers – those\nwith the most influence over product design and higher-order circularity initiatives – to take responsibility\n69\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | \n | Box 5.1 – Product stewardship schemes in Australia | \n |  | \n | A product stewardship scheme (PSS) establishes shared responsibility among businesses across the | \n | supply chain, including manufacturers, importers and (sometimes) retailers, to manage a product’s | \n | environmental and human health impacts throughout its life cycle (DCCEEW nd; PSCOE nd). | \n | Each PSS is run by a scheme operator (industry or government), which pools funding from participating | \n | businesses to address the product’s collective impact.

Improving public awareness and consumer education on the safe\ndisposal of e-waste, particularly for products with embedded lithium-ion batteries due to the risk of fires and\ninjuries as raised by the ACCC (2023b, p. 42), is also an important complement to well-designed and\neffective product stewardship.\n5.2 Ensure a nationally consistent approach to product\nstewardship for small electronics\nSmall electronics, including personal devices (mobile phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, game consoles),\nhousehold products (kitchen appliances, grooming devices, electric toothbrushes, remote controls, small\nvacuum cleaners) and other equipment (power tools, children’s toys, lighting products) represent one of the\nfastest growing e-waste categories in Australia. By 2040, the volume of small electronic waste in Australia is\nprojected to exceed 400,000 tonnes annually, a significant proportion of which remains unmanaged under\nexisting product stewardship schemes (CIE 2023a, pp. 3–4). All Australian Environment Ministers have\nrecognised the urgent need to address the fire risks largely caused by embedded batteries in small\nelectronic waste (DCCEEW 2024d, p. 1, 2024e, p. 2).\nThe incorrect storage and disposal of small electronic products can cause harm to the environment and\npresent serious health and safety risks, as well as missed opportunities for the recovery of highly valuable\nmetals such as gold and silver. Many of these devices contain embedded lithium-ion batteries and other\nhazardous components, and their small size means that households often discard them in general waste\nstreams or store them indefinitely (Jayasiri et al. 2023, p. 1). The increased prevalence of lithium-ion battery\nproducts is expected to increase battery-related fires in homes, trucks and waste facilities, as well as the risk\nof toxic leachate contaminating soil and groundwater (ACCC 2023b, pp. 16–17, 20).\n2 These include amending copyright laws to allow repairers to bypass digital locks for legitimate repair activities; requiring\nmanufacturers to provide access to repair information, spare parts and tools; stronger enforcement of consumer\nguarantees on durability; and oversight of restrictions that potentially limit competition in independent repair markets.\n70\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | \n | Box 5.1 – Product stewardship schemes in Australia | \n |  | \n | for the products they place on the market.

While these schemes currently focus on recycling,\npartly because outcomes are easier to measure and infrastructure is more established, they also have scope\nto support reuse and repair activities, such as by setting targets, funding repair and parts recovery services\nand helping to develop secondary markets.\nAs identified earlier, many small electronic products such as kitchen appliances, personal care devices,\npower tools, children’s toys and e-cigarettes do not fall under these existing product stewardship schemes.\nThe main mechanisms for managing their disposal (if any) include voluntary programs, ad hoc council\ncollection points and retailer take-back initiatives.\nInquiry participants identified the need to address the risks posed by the incorrect disposal of small electronic\nproducts, particularly fire hazards associated with embedded lithium-ion batteries, and noted that voluntary,\nindustry-led product stewardship schemes are inadequate to manage these risks effectively (ACOR,\nsub. 256, p. 5; BSC, sub. 223 att. 1, pp. 2–3; WMRR, sub. 233, p. 12). The Senate Environment and\nCommunications References Committee’s report on waste reduction presented evidence from submissions\nand testimonies of the limited effectiveness of existing voluntary product stewardship schemes (including\nthose for tyres and batteries), citing low participation rates, lack of enforcement mechanisms and free-rider\nproblems (Environment and Communications Committee 2025, pp. 82–84).\nProduct stewardship could help drive both upstream design improvements and downstream recovery\nsystems for small electronic product waste in Australia in a more holistic, flexible and cost-effective way than\naddressing specific issues individually through policies like import standards, financial incentives (such as\nimport taxes, landfill levies or ‘cashback’ schemes), disposal bans and export restrictions.\n• While import standards can prevent unsafe or low-quality small electronics from entering Australia, they do\nnot address fire risks, which typically result from improper disposal and storage regardless of product\ndesign. Import standards also do not encourage consumers and businesses to divert used electronics\nfrom landfill to reuse or recycling, especially given the low cost and convenience of disposal, even when\nrecovery would deliver net benefits. Enforcement is also challenging, particularly for products sold online\nor entering through complex supply chains. Additionally, when based on international benchmarks, import\nstandards may not align with the maturity of Australia’s recycling infrastructure or recovery systems.\n• While financial incentives and disposal bans can influence behaviour, such as discouraging the landfill of\nsmall electronics, designing these instruments to be cost-effective and avoid unintended consequences\ncan be challenging. For example, raising waste levies alone may lead to increased illegal dumping or\nstockpiling in households. Avoiding such outcomes requires adequate collection and recycling\ninfrastructure to also be in place, which is a core focus of product stewardship schemes.\n• Export restrictions may prevent harmful dumping of e-waste overseas and keep valuable materials within\nAustralia, but without a framework to fund and coordinate safe collection and recycling they do not ensure\nthat domestic systems exist to manage this waste effectively.\nIn contrast, product stewardship schemes embed life cycle responsibility into industry practice and offer a\ncoordinated framework for managing e-waste. Unlike standalone policy tools, they can integrate upstream\nand downstream activities, aligning design improvements, consumer education and infrastructure funding\nwithin a single system. The nature of e-waste, including its growing volume, small and dispersed form, and\ncombination of both valuable and hazardous materials, means that risks emerge across multiple stages of\nthe electronic product life cycle. These range from poor design and limited repairability, to unsafe disposal\n3 The NTCRS is a co-regulatory product stewardship scheme for televisions and computers.

The measures discussed above may complement product stewardship, but\nthey cannot replace its integrated, system-wide approach.\nThe Australian Government has previously acknowledged the shortcomings of existing arrangements for\nmanaging e-waste streams, and commissioned analysis examining the benefits of a national co-regulatory\nproduct stewardship scheme for small electronics and solar PV systems. The Wired for Change discussion\npaper outlined a national co-regulatory product stewardship proposal for small electrical and electronic\nequipment (SEEE) and for small-scale solar PV systems (DCCEEW 2023d). A cost benefit analysis of the\nSEEE scheme found the costs associated with processing, administration and network operations would\nultimately be borne by the consumer but are outweighed by the environmental benefits, with an estimated\nnet economic benefit in present value terms of approximately $32 billion (CIE 2023a, p. 8).4\nAustralian Environment Ministers noted at the June 2024 Environment Ministers’ Meeting (EMM) that battery\nfires were becoming an escalating issue and interventions were required throughout the battery product life\ncycle (DCCEEW 2024e, p. 2). Inquiry participants, including some state and territory governments, raised the\nlimitations of ‘patchwork’ schemes across Australia and indicated their preference for a nationally led\napproach. These limitations included inconsistencies between jurisdictions, industry compliance, and dealing\nwith a large and diverse set of imported consumer electronics. However, given the urgent risk of battery fires,\nthe December 2024 EMM discussed a draft regulatory impact statement on state-based legislation\npresented by New South Wales and Victoria (DCCEEW 2024d, p. 1). The Product Lifecycle Responsibility\nAct 2025 (NSW) was introduced in March 2025 and is Australia’s first state-based, mandatory product\nstewardship framework, focusing initially on battery products including small electronics and requiring ‘brand\nowners’5 to register products, manage safe recycling and disposal, lead public education and improve\nproduct design for safety and recyclability.\nAs it appears through regular interjurisdictional meetings that states and territories are considering similar\nlegislation to progress their own product stewardship schemes for battery products, there remains an\nimportant role for the Australian Government to assist states and territories to ensure national consistency to\nlimit compliance burdens on manufacturers, importers, local governments and industry. To achieve this, the\nAustralian Government should work with state and territory governments to develop and implement an\nagreed national framework for state-based schemes. This national framework should focus on a core set of\ndesign features that provide consistency and reduce the risk of fragmentation, unnecessary complexity and\ncost to industry, including:\n• consistent definitions of scheme scope – clearly identifying which small electronic products are covered\nunder schemes to avoid confusion and regulatory gaps\n• clear performance targets for collection and recovery – ensuring that all jurisdictions are working towards\nthe same measurable outcomes, such as minimum collection rates or material recovery thresholds, to\ndrive accountability and ongoing improvement\n• nationally aligned compliance standards – so that safety, transport and handling protocols are\nharmonised, reducing risks in managing hazardous components and ensuring recyclers can operate\nacross jurisdictions without duplication or conflicting requirements\n• nationally transferable scheme registration requirements for brand owners – establishing clear processes,\nincluding a shared forum for registering products and identifying responsible entities, with consideration of\nmutual recognition between jurisdictions, to streamline compliance and improve transparency\n• shared data and reporting requirements – to support robust monitoring, enable cross-jurisdictional\nanalysis and build a national evidence base for improving scheme performance over time.\n4 This estimate is largely driven by non-market benefits – consumers’ willingness to pay for environmental damage\navoided by the scheme of about $150 per adult per year, on average (CIE 2023a, pp. 81, 84).\n5 Under s. 6(1)(a) of the Product Lifecycle Responsibility Act 2025 (NSW), a ‘brand owner’ owns the name under which a\nproduct is supplied in New South Wales.

Australia’s solar boom is projected to generate an 18-fold increase in PV waste\nfrom 2019 to 2030 as existing stock comes to the end of its useful life (DCCEEW 2021a, p. 7). The projected\ngrowth between 2025–2035 of the next generation of small-scale solar PV systems (262% over the next\n10 years) means the challenge managing this waste stream will extend well beyond 2030 (ACAP 2024, p. 5).\nThe rapid rise in the use of large-format batteries in products such as EVs is also expected to result in a\nstock of just over 4 million tonnes of EV batteries by 2050 (approximately 200,000 tonnes reaching end of life\nin 2050) (BSC and UTS ISF 2023, pp. 68, 72). Because of their bulky nature and the high costs associated\nwith recycling (including specialised handling and infrastructure) or proper disposal (Ecocycle, sub. 217, p. 5;\nRMIT University, sub. 212, p. 15), solar PV system and EV battery waste is often stockpiled or illegally\ndumped or exported to other countries (AADA, sub. 242, p. 3; Mathur, sub. 10, pp. 2–3).\nThis stockpiling and improper disposal can present significant environmental, health and safety risks,\nincluding leachate, fires, air pollution and the depletion of finite resources. Solar PV panels contain\nhazardous materials such as lead and cadmium, while the batteries used in both solar PV systems and EVs\ncontain lithium, cobalt, nickel and other high-value critical materials that can pose serious fire risks if not\nproperly managed. While only five of the 673 lithium-ion battery fires attended to by emergency services in\nNew South Wales from January 2022 to June 2024 involved EVs (Fire and Rescue NSW 2024, pp. 15, 23),\nthe end-of-life management of EV batteries presents emerging challenges due to increasing demand for\nEVs, the specialised training and equipment required to address fires at the disposal stage, and the risk of\nre-ignition hours or even days after the initial incident (Schmidt 2024).\nCurrently, neither solar PV systems nor EV batteries are managed in a consistent or comprehensive way once\nthey are considered to have reached their end of life. In Australia, the majority of end-of-life PV systems are\nsent to landfill or discarded in shredder floc, with some illegally dumped on roadsides or in bushland\n(CIE 2023b, p. 3). Though some private recycling services exist in Australia (for example, Sircel, PV Industries,\nEcoactiv), only 17% of solar panel components are recycled (specifically the aluminium frame and junction\nbox), with the remaining 83% of (valuable) materials treated as waste (Baumgurtel et al. 2024). This is largely\ndue to the cost barrier of recycling solar panels, which is approximately six times the cost of sending them to\nlandfill (Baumgurtel et al. 2024). Most EV batteries in Australia have not yet reached their end of use in\npassenger vehicles; however, as EV adoption grows, this waste stream is soon expected to increase.\nThere are some secondary markets for EV batteries, such as repurposing used batteries as stationary\nenergy storage for households. Australia’s EV battery recycling market is currently in its early stages, with\nlimited onshore processing capacity and few facilities able to safely or effectively disassemble complex\nbattery packs, especially those not designed for end-of-life recovery (Infinitev, pers. comm., 23 July 2025).\nThe growing volume of these import-dominated waste streams, the high-value, high-risk nature of their\nmaterials and the cost barrier to high-efficiency recycling in comparison to improper disposal means limited\noversight and ad hoc, voluntary approaches will not suffice in achieving circularity or managing potential\nenvironmental or physical harm.\nIntroducing regulated product stewardship schemes for small-scale solar PV systems and EV batteries could\naddress these challenges.\n• These schemes could provide secure funding for the development of specialised recovery infrastructure\nand logistics networks, which are essential for managing these complex and high-value, high-risk\n74", "text_len": 4392, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

A regulated scheme ensures coordinated investment in safe collection, transport and processing\nsystems that fragmented or voluntary efforts are unlikely to achieve at scale, especially as these waste\nvolumes surge (BCA, sub. 99, p. 2; CPVA, sub. 62, p. 4).\n• These schemes could also provide stronger oversight through a legally enforceable framework that holds\nmanufacturers (and importers, given the import dominance of these products in Australia) accountable for\nthe full life cycle of their products. By making producers responsible for end-of-life outcomes, this\nframework encourages higher-order circular activities, including design improvements such as enhanced\nrepairability and easier disassembly for recycling, as well as support for secondary markets (such as\nsecond-life battery applications) (Infinitev, pers. comm., 23 July 2025).\nProduct stewardship could help address the growing end-of-life challenge from solar PV systems and EV\nbatteries in a cost-effective way.\n• Whilst levers such as import standards or import taxes may improve the environmental profile of products\nentering the market, by themselves they do not ensure collection, safe handling or material recovery when\nsystems are decommissioned. For solar PV systems and EV batteries, the introduction of import\nstandards (that is, alignment with current international benchmarks or regulations) would need to be timed\nappropriately, considering: the possibility (at least initially) of higher purchase prices for consumers;\nongoing advancements in product design; and the barriers to realising wider benefits due to Australia’s\ncurrently limited recycling infrastructure and second-life market readiness (WMRR, sub. 233, p. 12).\n• Waste export bans may help keep solar PV systems and EV batteries available for recycling in Australia,\nbut would not by themselves be sufficient to drive the development of infrastructure to recycle used\nproducts or develop markets for second-life applications. New risks could also emerge if waste export\nbans result in increased stockpiling, in addition to other potential trade-related risks.\nIn contrast, a product stewardship scheme establishes a clear framework that assigns shared responsibility\nto manufacturers, importers and retailers (box 5.1). By establishing regulated outcomes or targets, such a\nscheme can incentivise design improvements and/or the import of products with improved design, supporting\ncost-effective scaling of recycling activities and second-life applications, and ensuring more equitable\ncost-sharing across the supply chain. Product stewardship can also create a platform for governments and\nindustry to consider and develop complementary measures in a coordinated way, allowing flexibility as these\nwaste streams grow and evolve.\nInternational experiences with regulated product stewardship schemes for solar PV systems and EV\nbatteries suggest effectiveness in supporting end-of-life management and resource recovery. The European\nUnion (EU) introduced mandatory producer responsibility for solar PV panels under the Waste Electrical and\nElectronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) in 2012 (EU 2012, pp. 16, 23) and regulations that require\nbattery producers to finance collection and meet recycling efficiency and recycled content targets in 2023\n(HSF Kramer 2023). Policy literature highlights the importance of regulatory frameworks, such as the EU’s\ninclusion of solar PV panels under the WEEE Directive, for enabling effective recycling practices (Ndalloka et\nal. 2024, pp. 4–5). Modelling of the EU’s 2023 EV battery regulations suggests that mandatory recycling\nrequirements encourage investment in recycling infrastructure, though balanced support is needed to\npreserve second-life battery markets (Seika and Kubli 2024, p. 1).\nIn Australia, the challenges associated with managing solar PV and EV products are shared across all states\nand territories. The solar PV sector is dominated by a relatively small number of large importers and\nmanufacturers operating nationally, who supply a broad network of local retailers and a large number of\ninstallers. The EV market is also dominated by a relatively small number of large importers and manufacturers\noperating nationally. Given the projected scale of these waste streams and their importance to emissions\nreduction targets, as well as the nationwide operations of businesses serving Australian markets, the PC is\n75", "text_len": 4449, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Mandatory regulation may not offer the\nappropriate flexibility needed to deal with the complexity and evolving nature of these emerging waste\nstreams, including changes to product design and advancements in recycling technologies.\nIn 2023, the Australian Government proposed a national co-regulatory scheme for small-scale solar PV\nsystems under the Wired for Change proposal, covering both new and legacy units. Organisations that\nimport or manufacture PV systems above a certain threshold would fund the scheme by paying fees to a\ncentral administering body (appointed and overseen by the Australian Government) to provide drop-off\npoints, undertake recycling activities and manage contracts and payments with network operators\n(DCCEEW 2023d, pp. 28–30).\nCost-benefit analysis commissioned by the Australian Government found that scheme costs for the Wired for\nChange proposal are likely to be outweighed by the environmental benefits of greater uptake of\nhigh-efficiency recycling, with an estimated net economic benefit in present value terms of $7.3 billion\n(CIE 2023b, p. 75).6 Specifically, though scheme costs would ultimately be passed on to consumers in the\nform of higher upfront prices for solar PV systems, they are expected to be offset by the reduced price in\ncharging for the decommissioning of these systems at the end of their life (CIE 2023b, p. 81).7\nThere is currently no equivalent analysis for a national EV battery product stewardship scheme. Reflecting\nthe different levels of evidence to support co-regulatory schemes for solar PV systems and EV batteries, the\nAustralian Government should urgently progress its proposed scheme for solar PV systems and conduct a\ncost-benefit analysis with input from industry to understand the feasibility of a similar scheme for EV batteries\n(BSC 2024), including exploring and comparing different options for scheme design and implementation\nmodels. The existing cost-benefit analysis on the national solar PV systems scheme and any future study on\na national EV battery scheme should be made public to allow independent assessment.\n6 This estimate is largely driven by non-market benefits – consumers’ willingness to pay for the environmental damage\navoided by the scheme of about $1,577 per solar PV system installed, on average (CIE 2023b, pp. 73, 75).\n7 On 15 August 2025, the Energy and Climate Change Ministerial Council Meeting discussed the need for mandated\nstewardship arrangements to proactively manage solar panel waste. Energy and Climate Change Ministers agreed the\nAustralian Government and New South Wales will lead investigations into how different models of a national product\nstewardship scheme will work including evaluating Australian Government and state-based approaches (DCCEEW 2025m).\n76", "text_len": 3873, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The Australian Government is yet to use monitoring and public reporting to\nincrease industry effort and participation in voluntary product stewardship schemes, to its full potential.\nIn the interim report, the PC identified that enhanced textiles product labelling focusing on circular design\nprinciples such as repairability, durability and sustainable materials, is a potential area for further government\naction. Inquiry participants and studies highlighted that improving the availability and reliability of information\nabout the circularity of textiles products could increase materials productivity by enabling sustainable business\nand consumer choices and more effective reuse and recycling, noting examples from other countries (box 6.1).\nAustralia will be in a better position to assess the benefits and optimal design of a domestic labelling scheme\nfor textiles and clothing once recently introduced international schemes and design standards (including\nthose in France and the European Union (EU))2 have been in operation for a longer period. As major brands\nthat operate in or supply these markets will need to change their product labels to meet these requirements,\nthe additional costs of adopting similar labels for the Australian market (a major net importer of textiles and\nclothing products) could be comparatively low. Further, evaluations of the impacts and effectiveness of\ninternational schemes will help clarify whether and how an Australian scheme could work.

In doing so, it should set a clear, time-bound process for governments to introduce regulated\nproduct stewardship schemes for textiles and clothing if the sector does not meet defined expectations and if\na viable regulatory model can be developed.\nLimitations of textiles stewardship in Australia\nIn Australia, businesses that make, import or sell textiles may support initiatives to reduce waste and improve\ncircularity in textiles through voluntary industry-led product stewardship schemes or their own initiatives.7\nCurrently, there are voluntary product stewardship schemes for clothing (commenced 2024) and bedding\n(commenced 2023).8 These product stewardship schemes collect levies from member organisations to fund\ncircular activities such as designing durable products, investing in recycling infrastructure and promoting\nsustainable consumption behaviour. More detail on product stewardship schemes in Australia can be found\nin chapter 5 (box 5.1).\nReflecting high levels of waste generation,9 low recycling rates10 and limited impact of voluntary efforts in the\ntextiles sector, the Australian Government Minister for the Environment included clothing textiles on the\nMinister’s Priority List in 2021-22, and mattresses in 2022-23. In early 2024, the Minister for the Environment\nstated that if the voluntary stewardship scheme for clothing is not sufficiently adopted by industry, it will be\nformally regulated by the Australian Government (DCCEEW 2024k).\nSeveral participants noted that the voluntary nature of the product stewardship scheme for clothing could severely\nlimit its effectiveness in reducing waste and increasing adoption of circular practices for textiles.11 They noted that\nthe voluntary nature of the scheme results in free riding,12 which reduces the amount of funding for sector-led\ninitiatives (Resource Work Cooperative, sub. 30, p. 6; SSROC, sub. 26, p. 9). The clothing product stewardship\nscheme, Seamless, estimated there are 14,000 potentially liable parties across the sector (Seamless, sub. 240,\np. 7), but the scheme had only 58 member businesses as at July 2025 (Seamless nd).\nReflecting these concerns, several participants called for the Australian Government to make participation in\nproduct stewardship schemes in the textiles and clothing sector mandatory (PSCOE, sub. 267, p. 6;\n7 Examples of product stewardship initiatives managed by individual business include the Conscious Koala product\nstewardship initiative, Kathmandu product stewardship initiatives, Kitx product stewardship initiative, Nudie Jeans repair\ninitiatives, Patagonia Worn Wear program, and The ICONIC product stewardship initiatives.\n8 The Australian Bedding Stewardship Council Scheme, an industry-led non-accredited voluntary scheme, was\nintroduced in 2023 and provides national recycling solutions for mattresses (including in regional communities). The\nscheme is funded through a product stewardship fee of $10 per mattress, approved by the Australian Competition and\nConsumer Commission (ACCC).\n9 In the 2022-23 financial year, approximately 860,000 tonnes (33 kg per capita) of textiles related waste was generated,\nan increase from about 780,000 tonnes in 2016-17 (DCCEEW 2025c, p. 46).\n10 Australia’s textiles recycling rate (excluding charitable donations) is 5% (DCCEEW 2025c, p. 41).\n11 Monash University (sub. 262, p. 10); RMIT University School of Fashion and Textiles (sub. 231, p. 15); Third Pillar\n(sub. 219, p. 4); WRAP (sub. 230, p. 18); WMRR (sub. 233, p. 10).\n12 Free riding occurs when a business benefits from the actions of another without paying for or sharing the costs.

The Seamless Consortium noted that making participation in textiles products\nstewardship schemes mandatory would make it easier for stakeholders to progress change, alleviate\nparticipants’ concerns that their contributions are supporting free riders and make it easier to forecast\nincome, expenditure and the level of contribution required (AFCC 2023, p. 21). Seamless noted that ‘by\nadopting mandatory participation in industry-led schemes, the administrative burden on government can be\nshifted to industry, with government instead focused on enforcement to ensure compliance’ (sub. 240, p. 7).\nOthers noted that businesses do not participate in voluntary product stewardship schemes for a variety of\nreasons, and that non-participation does not mean they are not making efforts to reduce waste or implement\ncircular practices. Reasons for not participating in voluntary product stewardship schemes can include the\nhigh cost of the levy relative to the private benefits of participation, sustainability and circularity not being\ncore business objectives, and businesses already having their own sustainability practices (RMIT University\nSchool of Fashion and Textiles, sub. 231, p. 15; WRAP, sub. 230, p. 18).\nIf participation rates in product stewardship schemes do not increase, it is unlikely Seamless will achieve its\ngoal to ‘make Australian clothing circular by 2030, and significantly reduce the 222,000 tonnes of clothing\nthat goes to Australian landfill each year’ (Seamless, sub. 240, p. 1). Seamless assumed close to full market\nparticipation when it calculated the levy13 that is necessary to deliver sufficient revenue to achieve the\nscheme’s objectives (which it estimated at $60 million per year).\nIncreasing accountabilities for textiles stewardship\nWhile a regulated product stewardship scheme for textiles and clothing would have advantages (such as\nmaking it easier for stakeholders to progress change), implementing such a scheme without first allowing for\nother policy measures (including international reforms) to take effect, could result in avoidable costs. These\ncosts include the costs for government in setting up, administering and enforcing the scheme, as well as\ncompliance costs for businesses (which could potentially impact on their customers). Moving to a mandatory\nmodel too soon might also hinder productive voluntary collaboration on textiles sustainability.\nFurthermore, the Australian Government is yet to use monitoring and public reporting to increase industry\neffort, and participation in voluntary product stewardship schemes, to its full potential. The government\nshould adopt additional measures to create greater accountability for textiles businesses to drive the\nrequired behaviour change. Despite textiles and clothing having now been on the Ministerial Priority List for\nfour years, there is little sign that issues in the sector such as high levels of waste generation, low recycling\nrates and persistent free riding under the voluntary scheme are abating.\nFirst, the Australian Government should set a clear, time-bound process for introducing regulated product\nstewardship schemes for textiles and clothing if the sector does not meet expectations for reducing waste and\nimproving materials productivity.14 These expectations (possibly including targets) would be made public, and\ncould relate directly to advancing the objects of existing policies such as the Recycling and Waste Reduction\nAct 2020 (Cth) (RAWR Act) (for example, reducing the amount of waste generated, increasing resource\nrecovery and recycling, and reducing the environmental and human health impacts of products and waste\nmaterials). The government could also require individual businesses to collect and report on related data.\n13 Seamless is funded by a levy on each item of clothing placed on the Australian market, paid by clothing brands and\nretailers who are members. The levy is 4 cents per new garment and 3 cents for garments that meet eco-modulation\ncriteria (i.e. garments primarily made from mono-material or single fibre type at a minimum of 95%).\n14 The process could draw from existing frameworks, such as the Treasury’s approach to prescribing industry codes of\nconduct that provide a structured process for transitioning from voluntary to mandatory codes (The Treasury 2017).\n84", "text_len": 4421, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

In France, collection rates have improved since the mandatory EPR scheme for textiles\nintroduction in 2008 (2 kg per person in 2009 to 3.7 kg per person in 2019) and outperformed the EU average collection\nrate (31% in France compared with 22% in the EU) (Brown and Borkey 2024; Wilson 2021). WRAP (2022) estimated that\nimplementing a national textiles EPR scheme could increase textiles recycling by 8% and reduce landfill by 18% in the\nUK. A study by Eunomia (2022) found that EPR with modulated fees (such as lower fees for more durable or recyclable\nproducts) incentivises design for longevity, repairability and recyclability in textiles.\n85\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  |  | Recommendation 6.1 | \n |  |  | Enhance monitoring and public transparency measures to create greater accountability for | \n |  |  | textiles businesses to reduce waste and improve materials productivity | \n | To create greater accountability for textiles businesses to reduce waste and improve materials |  |  | \n | productivity, the Australian Government should introduce enhanced monitoring, public reporting and |  |  | \n | transparency measures. |  |  | \n | This should include setting a clear, time-bound process for governments to consider introducing regulated |  |  | \n | product stewardship schemes for textiles and clothing if the sector does not meet expectations regarding |  |  | \n | reduced waste and improved materials productivity. |  |  | \n | • Within the next six months, the Australian Government should establish criteria and timelines for |  |  | \n | assessing industry progress and publish conditions for considering regulatory intervention. |  |  | \n | • The government should work with industry to enhance publicly available information for tracking |  |  | \n | progress towards performance targets, which may include the percentage of businesses participating in |  |  | \n | voluntary stewardship arrangements or making equivalent efforts to reduce waste and improve |  |  | \n | materials productivity through circular activities. |  |  | \n | • After two years, if voluntary progress against performance criteria is insufficient, the government should |  |  | \n | commission analysis of regulatory models, including cost-benefit analysis, and implement the most |  |  | \n | appropriate regulatory pathway.

These brokers would collaborate with local communities, businesses and\ngovernments to identify, plan for and address local circular economy needs.\n7.1 Reform, harmonise and align regulations\nAddressing regulatory barriers and inconsistencies\nReducing (and where possible avoiding) inconsistencies in regulations across jurisdictions promotes\ncircularity by reducing costs for businesses operating across state and territory borders. Different settings for\ndifferent jurisdictions can be justified where local environments, activities and preferences differ. But in other\ncases, jurisdictional regulations could be aligned – particularly where the differences between states and\nterritories are definitional or administrative, rather than substantive or relating to outcomes. Aligning\nadministrative requirements reduces the regulatory burden on businesses with national operations and\nreduces frictions for businesses deciding where or whether to expand.1\nBelow are some examples of potentially unnecessary inconsistencies in standards and regulations across\nstates and territories.\n• Differences in specifications on allowable content for recycled materials in infrastructure construction\nprojects, even where standards are based on the same data and industry standards. For example, New\nSouth Wales’s specification for allowable recycled crushed glass as granular base and subbase in road\npavement is 10%, whereas in Victoria it is 5–10% for granular base and 15–50% for granular subbase\n(TfNSW 2020, p. 17; VIC DTP 2023b, p. 6; VicRoads 2017, p. 1). The Productivity Commission\nrecommends governments facilitate a stocktake and assessment of standards and specifications limiting\nuptake of sustainable materials in infrastructure to enable reforms to streamline regulations (chapter 2).\n• Inconsistent waste classifications, including for organics, e-waste and products made using recycled\nwaste. For example, over 20 different regulations govern the classification, transport and management of\nplastic waste in Australia (ACOR 2024, p. 8; DCCEEW 2024o, p. 44).\nIn addition to the regulatory barriers and inconsistencies highlighted in the previous chapters of this report,\nparticipants also highlighted regulatory inconsistencies in other areas, such landfill levies (Veolia Australia\nand New Zealand, sub. 193, p. 2), planning and zoning regulations (Australian Pork Ltd, sub. 69, p. 2;\nJemena, sub. 250, p. 1; Xseed, sub. 7, p. 14) and health regulations (ACOR, sub. 75, p. 37; CIPS Australia\nand New Zealand Pty Ltd, sub. 161, p. 6), which affect the economic feasibility of circular activities relative to\nlinear alternatives.\n1 The benefits of harmonised regulations are not unique to the circular economy. For example, the PC inquiry into\ncreating a more dynamic and resilient economy has identified duplicate or inconsistent regulation as a prominent\ngovernment failure across the economy which adds an unnecessary regulatory burden on businesses (PC 2025b, p. 32).\nLikewise, as part of the national competition policy reforms, the PC has estimated harmonised regulations and adopting\ninternational and overseas standards in regulatory frameworks (both relevant to the circular economy and beyond) to\nhave benefits of between $1.9 and $3.8 billion dollars per year (PC 2025d, p. 3).\n88", "text_len": 3807, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Where new regulations are being developed across multiple jurisdictions (such as\nstate-based product stewardship frameworks (chapter 5)), ensuring that they are consistent and not\nunnecessarily onerous or restrictive from the outset is the best way to reduce costs and uncertainty for\nbusiness. Delays in reforming and aligning regulations could postpone the associated economic and\nenvironmental benefits and risk locking in suboptimal arrangements.\nAustralian, state and territory governments should work together on aligning regulations because each level\nof government is responsible for different policy instruments (chapter 1) operating concurrently to achieve\ndesired economic and environmental outcomes.\nEstablish a taskforce to drive further regulatory reforms and\nharmonisation\nTo support the ongoing transition to a circular economy, the Australian Government should, as soon as\npracticable, set up a Circular Economy Regulatory Reform Taskforce with state and territory governments.\nThe objective of the taskforce should be to align and adjust new and existing regulations affecting the uptake\nof circular economy opportunities. While governments are already aligning some regulations,2 as noted by\nthe Circular Economy Ministerial Advisory Group, existing intergovernmental forums (such as the\nEnvironment Ministers’ Meeting or senior officials meetings) have not addressed longstanding regulatory\nissues such as the fragmentation of regulations governing the classification and reuse of waste materials\n(DCCEEW 2024o, p. 44). A taskforce with dedicated resources and ministerial authorisation would\nstrengthen governments’ capacity to reform and align regulations affecting the circular economy.\nThe taskforce should be located within the Australian Government, to task the Australian Government with\nthe lead on key issues where inaction could result in costly differing state-led approaches. This leadership is\nespecially important where jurisdictions have differing priorities and regulatory resources. The convening\npower of the Australian Government would also provide jurisdictions with a dedicated forum to agree on\nwhich regulations should be addressed as a priority, how regulations should be aligned (for example,\nalignment to which settings) and where exclusions or location-specific settings may still be required.\nGiven the resources already allocated to the Circular Economy Division within the Australian Government\nDepartment of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW), the taskforce should\ninitially be based in DCCEEW. However, recognising the interconnected economic, environmental, and\nsocial advantages of eliminating regulatory barriers to a circular economy – as well as the fact that relevant\nregulations are not solely managed by environment portfolios – consideration should also be given to the\npotential for enhanced leadership from central agencies (chapter 10). At a minimum, the taskforce must\nestablish strong connections with the regulation reform and review agendas of treasury and finance\ndepartments.3 This would ensure their recommendations are aligned with the principles of regulatory\nstewardship (discussed below).\n2 State and territory governments are working together on harmonising requirements under the National Kerbside\nCollections Roadmap following in-principle agreement from the Environment Ministers’ Meeting (DCCEEW 2024d, p. 1).\nAustroads is also in the process of developing a set of harmonised state infrastructure specifications for roads and\nbridges (Austroads 2021, p. 3).\n3 The PC’s inquiry into creating a dynamic and resilient economy proposes stronger scrutiny of regulation through\nCabinet (PC 2025b, p. 36).\n89", "text_len": 3967, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

While some participants suggested bodies with a stronger\npolicy-making power, for example, a circular economy ministerial council (TSA, sub. 220, p. 20) or an\nindependent circular economy standards board (DCCEEW 2024c, p. 44; Monash University, sub. 262,\np. 19), these bodies would involve considerably higher administrative costs and risk introducing unnecessary\nlayers of bureaucracy. Some submissions observed that minimising bureaucracy was an essential\nconsideration for the efficiency of any new harmonisation body (AMEC, sub. 248, pp. 8–9; MCA, sub. 269,\np. 3). In the interest of stimulating the circular economy transition at the lowest cost, a regulatory reform\ntaskforce is the most appropriate first step.\nThe taskforce should formulate recommendations for regulatory alignment in accordance with the principles of\nregulatory stewardship (figure 7.1), outlined in the PC’s inquiry into building a dynamic and resilient economy\n(PC 2025b, pp. 42–45). Regulatory stewardship requires public servants (involved in policy, regulation and\nprogram and service delivery) to manage regulatory systems to promote a dynamic and resilient economy, not\njust as a tool to reduce harm or manage risk. When making decisions, policymakers should focus on the overall\nsocietal benefits the regulations will promote, rather than specific narrow objectives.\nStewardship also requires policymakers and regulators to foster a collaborative culture which encourages\nregulatory consistency (both between Australian states and territories, and between Australia and the rest of\nthe world) and minimises duplication. Stewardship ensures the ongoing relevance and suitability of\nregulation through ongoing monitoring, data collection and review. These principles are especially relevant to\nregulations pertaining to the circular economy, where technical innovation and product development has\nhistorically outpaced regulatory evolution (for example, regulations for biochar as discussed in chapter 3).\nThe work of this taskforce will also include identifying and progressing other cross-sectoral reforms.\nHowever, it is not the PC’s intention that the regulatory reforms recommended elsewhere in this report be\ndependent on the establishment of the taskforce. For example, the steps required to progress the regulatory\nstocktake of infrastructure construction standards and specifications (chapter 2), to establish dedicated\nregulatory pathways for secondary organic materials (chapter 3) or to design consistent product stewardship\nregulations for small electronics (chapter 5) cannot, and should not, be constrained by any delays in the\nestablishment of this taskforce.

By contrast, more conventional government\nactions are planned and coordinated centrally, so may not engage with the specific characteristics of a place.\nPlace-based approaches can be impactful where a community faces a complex or multifaceted challenge\nthat needs a long-term and cross-sectoral response. They can be effective where a problem cannot be\naddressed through (centrally delivered) services or infrastructure provision alone and requires local\ncommunities to be actively involved to find relevant solutions (Victorian Government 2023).\nA place-based approach could be well-suited to facilitating a more circular economy at the local level, as\ncircular economy solutions often rely on local resources, industries and community involvement. Local\nexpertise and infrastructure can support circular practices such as resource recovery, repair and reuse\n(DCCEEW 2024c, p. 71). Place-based approaches to a circular economy can:\n• foster economies of agglomeration creating the necessary concentration of businesses, consumers and/or\nproduction factors required to perform circular economy activities\n• reduce the distance and therefore transport costs (including time and emissions savings) between\norganisations along the supply chain, such as downstream customers and upstream suppliers and inputs\n• increase the proximity and therefore the accessibility of infrastructure by enabling co-located organisations\n• facilitate the circulation of information and increase the coordination of local actors, accelerating change\n(Tapia et al. 2021, pp. 1444–1447).\nPlace-based connectivity also has broader benefits such as local employment opportunities, social\nengagement and cohesion. In establishing place-based circular initiatives, there is an opportunity to integrate\ncaring for Country principles and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge systems so that these\nresource management and regenerative practices can be undertaken (Bega LALC, sub. 185, p. 1;\nDCCEEW 2024c, p. 29).\nIdentifying local opportunities and co-designing circular economy plans\nAcross Australia there are place-specific circular economy opportunities and challenges. Places have unique\nbuilt and natural environments, economic conditions and communities, and are at different points in their\ntransition to a circular economy, with particular differences between cities and regional areas (Monash\nUniversity, sub. 262, p. 21). For example, some regional and remote areas may not have access to basic\nwaste management infrastructure, including local facilities such as recycling stations or materials recovery\ncentres, which limits their practical engagement with the circular economy (First Nations Economics,\nsub. 252, p. 15). However, filling those infrastructure gaps can also present opportunities to build in circular\neconomy principles and practices from the outset. This can then deliver economic and social benefits – for\nexample, the establishment of the Cherbourg Materials Recovery Facility on Wakka Wakka Country in\nQueensland has created jobs and upskilling opportunities for the community (Bell 2019). Other places are\n4 ‘Place’ does not have a universal definition. To be practical for circular economy policy actions, the PC defines a 'place'\nas either one local government area or a cluster of local government areas that are interconnected through their\ncommunities and economic, social, and environmental interactions.\n92", "text_len": 3929, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Bega has well-developed local business partnerships that support circular economy outcomes – such\nas utilising waste streams,5 synergistic agricultural practices such as ‘enterprise stacking’ and regenerating\nnature. There are also opportunities to integrate circularity into regions and areas which are being developed\nand transformed to meet complementary goals (for example, Renewable Energy Zones, the Western Sydney\nAerotropolis, sites for the Brisbane 2032 Olympics and areas experiencing mine closures (chapter 4)).\nLocal government structures and governance arrangements also vary significantly from place to place. For\nexample, Queensland has a series of Indigenous Councils where local governments are primarily run by\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, and New South Wales has Joint Organisations, which are\nstatutory bodies that enable councils in regional areas to collaborate on strategic priorities.\nAustralian and state government circular economy plans, such as Australia’s Circular Economy Framework\nor Recycling Victoria’s A new economy plan, set the broad policy direction for a circular economy but need\ntranslation to a level of detail that engages with local grassroots initiatives or industry. They may also\ninevitably miss contextual differences and challenges, particularly for regional and rural areas (Mathur,\nsub. 10, p. 1; Monash University, sub. 262, p. 21). The PC heard that translating these objectives into\nsolutions at the local level is complex (Roundtable participants, pers. comm., 29 May 2025). Local\ngovernment could use place-based circular economy plans to guide their delivery of local solutions (Monash\nUniversity, sub. 262, p. 21).\nLocal governments should identify circular economy opportunities relevant to their area. To realise these\nopportunities, they should develop place-based plans and/or integrate actions into their other plans and\nbudgetary processes. Plans should be developed through a co-design process with local businesses and\ncommunities, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. To ensure that the plans reflect local\ncommunities’ priorities, the co-design process should empower communities to identify their economic,\nenvironmental and cultural priorities and needs that can be addressed through circular economy initiatives.\nThese priorities and needs should be translated into measurable goals, which local governments can monitor\nprogress against. Evaluation and iteration of the plan should occur at minimum once every three years to\npromote accountability and ensure it remains relevant.\nPlaces are diverse and local governments will vary in their capacity to influence the transition due to factors\nsuch as demographics, council structures, resources and location (Hume City Council, sub. 20, p. 2). Local\ngovernments should therefore select an approach to circular economy planning that is fit for purpose given\ntheir context. For some local governments, a circular economy plan may simply highlight barriers requiring\ninvestment and support from state or Australian governments, such as lack of waste management and\nmaterials recovery infrastructure. By contrast, local governments that have greater resources or those with\nexisting circular activity in their region will develop more multifaceted plans with a broader transformation\nagenda. Local governments could also integrate actions related to the circular economy into their other plans\nand budgetary processes instead of, or as well as, developing a specific circular economy plan. Relevant\nplans and processes that could incorporate circular economy actions include service, infrastructure or\ncommunity development plans, local environmental or economic plans, or regional plans such as those for\nSpecial Activation Precincts or Renewable Energy Zones, as noted above.\n5 For example, The Bega Group’s dairy factory boiler runs on wood waste and fly ash residue used as a lime\nreplacement on pastures, and extracts milk minerals from whey waste using a new evaporator (Courtney 2024).\n93", "text_len": 4193, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

State governments are well-positioned to collate examples\nof place-based circular economy plans as they are developed as well as existing examples of local circular\neconomy plans such as the Hunter and Central Coast Circular Economy Roadmap in New South Wales or\nCircular Economy Opportunities Limestone Coast in South Australia (Hunter Circular 2022; RDA Limestone\nCoast 2022). They could also provide resources such as templates and guidance for plan development,\ntailored to suit local governments at different stages of the circular economy transition.\nBrokers could catalyse place-based circular economy transitions\nWhere governments have identified that place-based approaches are likely to be an effective way of\nachieving circular economy outcomes, they can support local communities by providing access to\nintermediaries or transition brokers. Transition brokers facilitate sustainability transitions by connecting and\naligning diverse stakeholders to create momentum for change, enable collaboration and drive innovation\n(Kivimaa et al. 2019, pp. 1062–1063; Lobo et al. 2025, p. 5013).

A case study of circular economy transition brokers in six Dutch regions\nfound that they ‘enhance processes of change, build alliances, help create the necessary preconditions, and\ndevelop impactful circular initiatives’ (Cramer 2020, p. 1). In the study, each broker drafted a circular\neconomy program based on regional strengths and then supported companies to implement circular\ninitiatives, including through fostering collaboration. At the time of the study, some regions were at the stage\nof repeating and upscaling successful initiatives, with the eventual goal of making the circular economy\nmainstream within the region (Cramer 2020, p. 10).\nWhile a program of circular economy transition brokers would be relatively novel in Australia, governments\nand inquiry participants have indicated the potential value of such brokers to furthering the success of\ncircular initiatives (CERN APAC, sub. 215, p. 3; DCCEEW 2024c, p. 71). Inquiry participants with experience\nin place-based approaches agreed that transition brokers could provide several benefits including providing\nlocal leadership for change, helping local businesses and communities form networks, find partnerships and\ntake up circular opportunities, and guiding how local government, businesses and communities can\ncontribute (Roundtable participants, pers. comm., 29 May 2025).\nThe Bega Regional Circularity Cooperative (RCC) is one of the few examples of using circular economy\ntransition brokers in Australia. The RCC has developed a ten-year program to identify, accelerate and\nimplement enabling projects to enhance the delivery of circularity in the region. The transition brokers in the\nRCC have helped coordinate circular economy initiatives from the local community and businesses, as well\nas large businesses, corporations, financial institutions, research organisations and multiple levels of\ngovernment. The knowledge, resources and networking opportunities provided by the RCC have accelerated\nthe uptake of circularity projects in the region (DCCEEW 2024c, p. 72; RAI, sub. 100 att., p. 27).\nBuilding capacity and partnerships for local circular economy transitions\nTransition brokers could help local businesses and community organisations build circular economy capabilities\nin ways that are tailored to the local community and context. Businesses often lack the necessary information,\ntools and resources to successfully adopt circular practices (CIPS, sub. 161, p. 6). General circular economy\ntraining (where available) is often not sufficiently tailored to assist small to medium businesses and community\norganisations successfully apply ideas to their own context.6 For example, First Nations Economics highlighted\n‘current policies and programs are rarely communicated in ways that reflect First Nations worldviews or address\ncommunity-specific realities’ (sub. 252, p. 15). A broker could help address these limitations through co-design\nof their services and partnering with local communities to offer services (such as education and support for\ncircular economy activities) to ensure they are relevant to the local context.\nTransition brokers could also help facilitate cross-sector partnerships and knowledge sharing among local\norganisations through initiatives such as hosting circular economy forums, workshops and networking events\n(RAI, sub. 203, p. 3). Transition brokers should develop networking opportunities that are suited to the\nrelevant place. Informal regular meet-ups or introductions between complementary organisations can be as\nvaluable as formal networking events.

Local organisations that have successfully engaged\nwith circular opportunities act as powerful examples for their peers and can demonstrate the value of circular\nbehaviours in a local context (Roundtable participants, pers. comm., 29 May 2025).\nTransition brokers could also be particularly valuable in helping small to medium businesses and community\norganisations navigate government processes, such as obtaining regulatory approvals and applying for\nfinancial support. Due to their limited resources, and lower capability and maturity in regulatory compliance,\nthese organisations often face greater challenges when navigating regulatory complexity and have lower\nawareness of available support mechanisms (Business Chamber Queensland, sub. 213, p. 4;\nDCCEEW 2024c, p. 63).\nTransition brokers could also help local governments develop and implement place-based circular economy\nplans. The PC heard that ‘leadership and trusted relationships between local government, community and\nlocal businesses are essential to create and maintain momentum for circular economy change’ (Roundtable\nparticipants, pers. comm., 29 May 2025). Transition brokers can connect relevant parties to identify local\nopportunities, align efforts and develop solutions to barriers (DCCEEW 2024c, p. 71). They could also assist\nlocal governments in building their own circular economy capability and knowledge.\nTransition broker pilots would build the case for a wider program\nSome state and territory governments are already conducting and funding the types of services that transition\nbrokers would engage in. For instance, Green Industries South Australia facilitated collaboration between\nHolla-Fresh, Bio Gro, and Rainbow Bee Eater to support Holla-Fresh’s transition to a renewable energy source\n(biomass to energy) (RAI, sub. 100, p. 5). Sustainability Victoria, through its Circular Economy Innovation Fund,\nhas supported a number of capability building activities (CEBIC 2024). One such activity was run through the\nGippsland Climate Change Network, which ran a training program to address gaps in circular economy\nknowledge and foster collaboration among Gippsland small to medium businesses (GCCN 2025).\nWhile there is broad support for government investment in the services transition brokers would offer among\ninquiry participants,7 expanding support from state and territory governments to establish place-based\ntransition brokers across Australia would require increased investment.8 While there are some examples of\nsuccessful transition broker services internationally (Cramer 2020; Kanda et al. 2020; Lobo et al. 2025),\nfurther evidence (including formal evaluations) is needed to robustly understand how to best design and\nanalyse the benefits and costs of an in-place circular economy transition broker program across Australia.\nTo build understanding of how in-place transition brokers can best assist local communities transition to a\ncircular economy, state and territory governments should pilot in-place transition brokers in up to (for\nexample) six initial locations. Within three years, state and territory governments should complete a\nconcurrent evaluation of the pilots’ effectiveness. If successful, governments should extend the piloted\ntransition brokers and roll out the program to other places across Australia. The pilots would act as a proof of\nconcept of the transition broker model for facilitating place-based circular economy transition, and would\nenable the identification of common risks, costs, benefits and success factors to inform future rollout.

State and\nterritory governments should make their evaluations of the pilots publicly available to contribute to a\nnation-wide body of evidence about this approach.\nThe number and places selected for pilots should be sufficiently diverse to provide insights into the varying\nopportunities and challenges that exist in places across Australia. Dimensions to consider include\nsocioeconomic factors, geographic (urban, regional and remote), existing infrastructure (such as materials\nrecovery facilities) and existing engagement and support for circular economy initiatives. The brokers could\nbe based within state government, but another option is to base them within existing organisations such as\nRegional Development Australia, National Resource Management Regions, local branches of industry\nassociations or chambers of commerce, not-for-profits or local governments. This not only offers an\nopportunity to draw on the capability and experience of personnel within these entities (many of whom\nperform brokerage roles and functions) but provides the potential for co-funded roles. The transition brokers\nshould be supported to act as a network, meeting regularly to share relevant resources, knowledge and\nlessons learned to minimise duplication and iteratively improve their services.\nIn implementing these pilot programs, state and territory governments should progress their commitments to\nthe National Agreement on Closing the Gap.\n• Consistent with Priority Reform 1, brokers in each place-based pilot should partner with Aboriginal and\nTorres Strait Islander knowledge holders to ensure that their services are ‘culturally relevant, promote\nintergenerational learning and reflect Indigenous governance principles’ (First Nations Economics,\nsub. 252, p. 23).\n• Consistent with Priority Reform 2, brokers should also seek opportunities to partner with Aboriginal and\nTorres Strait Islander organisations to deliver services that build circular economy capability (such as\neducation and support for circular economy activities).\n• Consistent with Priority Reforms 1, 2 and 3, governments should seek opportunities to recruit and\nresource Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander partners as brokers.\nIf the evaluations show that the transition broker approach is effective, a longer rollout is needed to create\nlasting change. The optimal program length may vary depending on the specific requirements and\nopportunities in a place – for example, the Bega RCC has established a ten-year transition program (RAI,\nsub. 100 att., p. 27). For the pilot, the decision to end or extend funding should be well before the initial\nfunding ceases (figure 7.2). A rolling funding approach and early decision on future funding would ensure\ncontinuity (or an orderly conclusion if funding was discontinued).

This\nincludes direct support such as procurement and grant programs, and indirect support such as removing\nregulatory barriers to simplify the innovation and investment ecosystem.\nChallenge-based funding for circular innovations\nBy its nature, circular economy innovation often requires collaboration and partnerships between businesses\nfrom different sectors, as well as governments, researchers and the community. While innovation can start in\nany one business, diffusing knowledge and collaborating across businesses and supply chains are integral\nto the widespread adoption of successful circular innovations.\nCircular innovators benefit from a diverse skillset. For instance, expertise in circular design, along with the\nability to think critically and systematically, can support the development of innovative products and\nsolutions. However, successful adoption of circular innovation goes beyond individual capabilities. It requires\ndevelopment and cultivation of the competencies needed to implement and scale circular practices, within\norganisations and governments (chapter 8).\nTesting, developing and adopting new approaches or technologies is a risky endeavour for any one business\n– particularly for small to medium businesses – and innovation diffusion across Australian businesses\ngenerally has been slow (PC 2023a, pp. 6–7). To improve the rate of diffusion, governments can minimise\ninvestment risk through innovation programs.\nExisting Australian Government programs support circular initiatives that promote materials productivity by\nhelping businesses to scale up existing innovations9 and by funding large-scale research aimed at\nprogressing the technological frontier.10 State, territory and local governments have also administered\nsignificant innovation programs focused on the circular economy. For example, through the Smart City\nInnovation Challenges, the NSW Government funded a solution to track precinct-level materials usage (NSW\nGovernment 2025), and the Victorian Government has provided grants to 25 recipients across four rounds11\nof the Circular Economy Innovation Fund (CEBIC 2024). Additionally, the Inner West Council in New South\nWales offers grants to support local organisations undertaking circular activities and to increase community\nawareness and knowledge of the circular economy (Inner West Council 2025, p. 5).\nAn approach to innovation that is being increasingly adopted in policy is mission-oriented or challenge-based\ninnovation. This approach allows policymakers to determine the direction of growth (Mazzucato et al. 2020,\np. 421), and aligns research, innovation and policy around clear, ambitious goals which encourage\ncross-disciplinary collaboration (Australian Academy of Science and ARC Centre of Excellence in Synthetic\nBiology, sub. 144, p. 1; Monash University, sub. 138, p. 5).\nInquiry participants have noted success with this approach (AMEC, sub. 248, p. 11; Monash University,\nsub. 262, pp. 18–19). For example, Unearthed Solutions has partnered with mining companies to source\nsolutions for a variety of challenges, including those related to the circular economy (AMEC, sub. 248, p. 11;\n9 For example, the National Reconstruction Fund, Future Made in Australia and green bonds.\n10 For example, Cooperative Research Centres, public research funding (CSIRO, universities) and the Critical\nTechnologies Challenge Program.\n11 Round 1 focused on collaboration initiatives and innovation in the food sector. Round 2 focused on initiatives to prevent\nwasted materials across the supply chain and textiles innovation. Round 3 focused on research and development of\nsustainable market solutions. Round 4 focused on initiatives that increase business knowledge of the circular economy.\n99", "text_len": 3915, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Over the past decade, Unearthed Solutions has helped source potential\nsolutions for 70 challenges faced by the resources industry (based on Unearthed Solutions 2025).\nChallenge-based grant programs have also been used to uplift innovation in government procurement. The\nNSW Government’s Choose Circular program funds solutions to challenges posed by government agencies\nseeking to incorporate new technologies and uses for recycled materials in their operations (NSW\nGovernment, sub. 139, p. 9). Similarly, the Australian Government’s Business Research and Innovation\nInitiative (BRII) targeted innovative solutions from small to medium businesses to address challenges posed\nby various government agencies. Despite recent evidence suggesting that Australian Government business\ngrants, as currently designed and implemented, may not overall be an effective lever for improving the\nfinancial performance of small to medium business recipients (Kavourakis et al. 2024, p. 5), an evaluation of\nthe BRII found that of the nine small and medium businesses that progressed to the proof of concept stage12\nin the first round of funding, five had their solution procured by government and eight had commercialised\ntheir solution (Nous Group 2021, p. 7). Evaluations of similar challenge-based programs in the United States\nand United Kingdom found that such programs successfully stimulated innovation and delivered value for\nmoney (NASEM 2020, pp. 132–133; Steer Economic Development 2022, pp. 55–56).\nAn Australian Government challenge-based grant program focused on the circular economy could help overcome\ndifficulties coordinating innovation among businesses, governments and researchers, and across sectors and\ndisciplines. While innovation is inherently risky, a well-designed program can lead to significant environmental,\nsocial and economic benefits for the public, and successful commercialisation outcomes (box 7.1).\nBox 7.1 – A challenge-based grant program to support innovative circular solutions\nKey features of a proposed challenge-based circular economy innovation program include having\nindustry and community collectively pose challenges of varying complexity and scale in an open and\ncriterion-based application process. In setting criteria and guidance for potential challenges and\nsolutions, the Australian Government should convey that selection will be based on their likelihood to\ndeliver economic, environmental and social benefits. If desired, this could be targeted to specific sectors\nor circular economy activities (design, reuse, repair, etc.).\nOversight of these processes should be carried out by a panel with diverse expertise to ensure robust\nassessment. Such a panel should have both government and industry expertise, as this has proven to be\neffective in similar challenge-based initiatives (Nous Group 2021, pp. 67–68).

However, a\nminimum scale of funding and timeframe is likely needed for any challenge, however small.

For the second stage, a minimum of\n$250,000 and 18 months should be afforded to applicants.\nWhile these minimum requirements may be suitable for smaller challenges,a some challenges which\nprovide large public benefit and involve significant collaboration will require funding commensurate with\ntheir scale. For reference, the Victorian Government’s Circular Economy Innovation Fund and Business\nSupport Fund have offered grants of up to $1 million (CEBIC 2025) and the European Union’s Horizon\nEurope program, which funds solutions for large-scale circular economy challenges, provided grants with\nan average size of €3 million (European Commission 2023).b\nEvaluations of similar programs have suggested that further funding and support should be provided\nbeyond the second stage of the program. The integration of industry and community perspectives\nthrough the challenge formulation process, as proposed in this program, should bolster prospects for\nsuccessful adoption or commercialisation within the first phase.\nTo encourage further collaboration and boost prospects of commercialisation or adoption, relevant\nindustry and/or community mentors should be matched with successful applicants to better tailor\nsolutions to industry and/or community needs.\na. For example, those that are funded through the BRII (DISR 2024a, p. 7, 2024b, p. 7), the Small Business\nInnovation Research program (United States), the Small Business Research Initiative (United Kingdom) and the\nInnovative Solutions Canada program (Nous Group 2021, pp. 101–102). b. Funding from these programs was\ncontingent on co-contributions from funding recipients.\nThis inquiry has identified some priority areas for challenges in the proposed program that would deliver\nsignificant public benefit. These challenges will require various scales of investment to address issues\nacross these supply chains.\n• For e-waste, challenges could form around viable reuse opportunities for emerging waste streams\nincluding solar photovoltaic systems and electric vehicle batteries (chapter 5).\n• Challenges could also seek to establish circular infrastructure in regional communities for materials of\nconcern including e-waste, tyres and plastics (Monash University, sub. 262, p. 22).\nChallenges should seek not only technical solutions but address a broad range of barriers. For example,\nthrough the Horizon Europe program, the European Union has posed a challenge to overcome the barriers\nto scaling up circular water management in agriculture. As part of this, funding recipients are required to\ndevelop solutions that overcome societal, behavioural and regulatory challenges that hinder the uptake of\ncircular water solutions for irrigation (European Commission 2025b, pp. 89–90).\nWhen implementing the challenge-based program, the Australian Government should also progress its\ncommitments under the National Agreement on Closing the Gap. With respect to progressing Priority\nReform 1 (partnerships and shared decision-making) and Priority Reform 3 (transforming government\norganisations), this program should invite and partner with community-controlled organisations to develop\nchallenges that would support, for example, workforce development, capital infrastructure and service\ndelivery.

However, investors can be reluctant to invest in circular\neconomy opportunities due to a lack of consistent information about businesses’ circularity performance\n(CA ANZ, sub. 211, p. 3), and regulatory and policy uncertainty and fragmentation (ACOR, sub. 75, p. 19;\nJemena, sub. 250, p. 5).\nTo help address the information gap and boost investor confidence, the Australian Sustainable Finance\nInstitute has, in partnership with the Australian Government, developed the Australian Sustainable Finance\nTaxonomy to support sustainable finance markets in Australia. While the first version of the taxonomy\nfocuses on setting criteria and classifications for climate mitigation activities across six sectors,13 it also sets\ncriteria to ensure that these activities do no significant harm in the transition to a circular economy\n(ASFI 2025, p. 130). These criteria ensure that resource use and wasted materials from an activity are\nidentified, minimised and managed. Specifically, activities should:\n• have a comprehensive waste management plan that incorporates the waste hierarchy\n• use product stewardship schemes or extended producer responsibility if available\n• develop recommissioning and rehabilitation plans when required to do so by law.\nThe development of the taxonomy is an important first step in addressing the broader issue of the lack of\nconsistent reporting and disclosure about circularity. Widespread business adoption of the Australian\nStandard for measuring and assessing circularity performance14 would also help standardise collection of\ncircular information. Having consistent definitions, classifications and processes for collecting circular\ninformation is integral to having consistent information reported between different businesses.\nSome inquiry participants noted that the taxonomy alone will not provide sufficient information to investors\nand suggested a need for mandatory reporting of circularity metrics akin to the recently introduced climate\ndisclosure requirements (CA ANZ, sub. 211, p. 3). Introducing mandatory reporting requirements on circular\nperformance would improve the consistency of information available to investors but would also impose\ncompliance costs on businesses (CIF, sub. 222, p. 4). Such an introduction at this current time would be\npremature given the nascency of the circular economy.\nIn addition to co-development of the taxonomy, the Australian Government is also supporting investment in\ncircular economy activities through its Green Bond program. The program aims to enable investors to back\npublic projects that drive Australia’s clean energy transition and support environmental objectives (The\nTreasury nd).

The current scheme is ineffective at promoting packaging circularity: only 19% of plastic packaging was\nrecovered for reuse in the 2022-23 financial year, one percentage point less than the previous year and well\nbehind the target of 70% (APCO 2024b, pp. 1, 20). While 86% of all packaging placed on the market is\nclassified as having good recycling potential, only 46% of plastic packaging has this classification\n(APCO 2024b, p. 9). The Australian Government Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment\nand Water (DCCEEW) has received submissions from, and conducted consultations with, hundreds of\nindustry stakeholders as part of their preparation of packaging regulation reform (DCCEEW 2025f).\nA central issue being considered by DCCEEW is whether a mandatory extended producer responsibility scheme\nshould be imposed on all liable suppliers to address concerns that the current co-regulatory system, which allows\nsuppliers to opt into one of two different regulatory streams, is resulting in inconsistent enforcement and free riding\n(AFGC, sub. 105, p. 3; Monash University, sub. 262, p. 11). Other related issues include whether, and how, to\nrecover the operating costs for the scheme through eco-modulated fees, and if minimum recycled content\nthresholds or targets should be applied. Many inquiry participants supported a mandatory extended producer\nresponsibility scheme for packaging with eco-modulated fees.4 For example, participants observed that a\nmandatory scheme for soft plastic packaging with minimum recycled content thresholds is essential for the\nsuccessful development of the market for recycled soft plastics (SPSA, sub. 202, p. 4). Other participants\nemphasised the need to consider international packaging regulations in the development of the scheme’s\nelements (BCA 2025, p. 7; Tetra Pak, sub. 41, p. 5), such as the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulations\nwhich will apply standards for labelling and chemicals use for packaging across the European Union (European\nCommission 2025c), and the associated cost of deviating from these standards.\nIn its interim report, the PC recognised the potential benefits of a mandatory scheme but also noted that the\nimpacts of different scheme models need to be examined, including by considering administration and\nenforcement costs and the potential for cost pass-through to consumers. The PC also noted the need to\nanalyse how measures in adjacent policy areas (such as the recently introduced public reporting of scope 3\nemissions for large entities) influence greater uptake of sustainable packaging (PC 2025a, p. 166). Recently,\nthe Australian Government joined 96 other countries in supporting the Nice wake up call for an ambitious\nplastics treaty (Watt 2025), a document which reaffirms Australia’s commitment to the High Ambition\nCoalition to End Plastic Pollution with the objective of establishing a treaty with the aim of ending plastic\npollution by 2040 (Plibersek 2024). The commitments within this treaty would necessitate further policy\nchanges which drive packaging sustainability.\nTo maintain reform momentum, build industry and community confidence and buy in, and enable external\nscrutiny, it is critical that the Australian Government publishes its proposed packaging regulatory reforms and\nsupporting analysis without delay.\n3 REDcycle was an industry-led program which partnered with major supermarkets to recover and recycle soft plastics\n(such as plastic bags, cling wrap and bubble wrap) (ACCC 2023a). In 2022, REDcycle suspended operations due to a\nlack of suitable recycling facilities, and supermarkets assumed responsibility of the approximately 11,000 tonnes of soft\nplastics stockpiled and awaiting recycling (ACCC 2025a).\n4 Boomerang Alliance (sub. 2, p. 1); Pact Group (sub. 77, p. 2); TEC (sub. 79, pp. 6–7); Tetra Pak (sub. 41, p. 3); Veolia\nAustralia and New Zealand (sub. 8, p. 1; sub. 193, p. 5); WMRR (sub. 168, p. 6).\n108", "text_len": 4330, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

A tax on virgin plastics could incentivise private and/or public\ninvestment in plastic recycling infrastructure. However, investors must also evaluate the operational costs of\ndomestic recycling (such as the costs of recovering, transporting and sorting used plastic) and how any\ninternational growth in plastics recycling from the widespread adoption of a treaty against plastic pollution\nwould impact the competitiveness of domestic recycled plastics against imported alternatives. Where\ndomestic recycling operations are constrained by high administrative costs – for example, because of the\nfragmented regulations currently governing the classification, transport and reuse of wasted plastics in\nAustralia (chapter 7) – they reduce the attractiveness of investing in domestic plastic recycling infrastructure\ncompared to importing recycled plastic from overseas. In these cases, governments should prioritise\nharmonising and streamlining regulations affecting domestic recycling before introducing taxes or subsidies.\nThe Australian Government would also need to consider what action is required to guarantee the credibility\nof recycled plastics claims. Without an adequate traceability mechanism8 to distinguish recycled plastics from\nvirgin plastics (whether manufactured domestically or internationally), any government action against virgin\nplastics could not be enforced.\nThe PC also suggests monitoring the recently introduced suite of United Kingdom packaging regulations –\nsuch as requirements for businesses to purchase credits to cover the difference between their actual plastic\npackaging recycling rates and the targets set by government (UK DEFRA and UK EA 2025) – and evaluate\nthe potential applicability of these policies to Australia once more evidence becomes available.\n5 Plastics are difficult to recover and recycle – almost 90% of wasted plastic is landfilled each year (DCCEEW 2025c, p. 46),\nwhere it poses contamination risks to ecosystems and waterways through leachate (Hossain et al. 2024, p. 1). Plastics can\nalso shed microplastics (plastic fragments less than five millimetres) into the environment during manufacturing, use, recycling\nor disposal which can pollute oceans and cause adverse health effects in sea life and humans when consumed (Issac and\nKandasubramanian 2021, p. 5; Jadhav et al. 2021, pp. 1, 2, 6; Ncube et al. 2020, p. 2; Suzuki et al. 2022, p. 8).\n6 The United Kingdom Government introduced a tax (currently GBP 223.69 per tonne) on manufacturers and importers of\nplastic packaging made from less than 30% recycled plastics in April 2022 (UK HMRC 2023, 2025).\n7 In the 2022-23 financial year, Australia had an annual plastic packaging recycling capacity of 343,000 tonnes, but\nplaced approximately 1.3 million tonnes of plastic packaging on the market (APCO 2024b, p. 27). Therefore, even if\noperating at maximum capacity – which is unlikely, given only 38% of Australia’s plastic packaging recycling capacity\nwas utilised in the 2022-23 financial year (PC estimate, based on APCO 2024b, pp. 22, 27) – as of June 2023, Australia\ncould only supply enough recycled plastic to meet roughly 27% of plastic demand for packaging (PC estimate, based on\nAPCO 2024b, pp. 14, 27).\n8 Australia currently has a voluntary national framework for recycled content traceability which takes an outcome-focused\napproach for all recycled materials (DCCEEW 2025a, p. 6).\n109", "text_len": 4457, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

However, the scheme does not regulate the use,\nstorage and disposal of manufactured products that contain industrial chemicals (AICIS 2025) as this is\nregulated by other Australian, state and territory legislation.11\nTo continue effectively managing the risks posed by chemicals of concern, governments need to design and\nimplement regulations that are adaptable and responsive.12 Regulatory approaches to achieving this include:\n• harmonisation across jurisdictions, products and applications to avoid compliance confusion and ensure\nbest practice is the norm (Wakefield-Rann 2022, pp. 8–9)\n• designing regulation informed by timely information from industry and research to enable an assessment\nof the level of scale and magnitude of impact of the hazardous materials\n• evaluating the point in the product life cycle for regulatory action that maximises net benefits. For example,\ninquiry participants have suggested that regulating the manufacture, importation and use of such\nchemicals, or products that contain them, could provide a significant benefit relative to the costs of\naddressing contamination (ACOR, sub. 256, pp. 12–13; WMRR, sub. 233, pp. 8–9). Such a regulation\ncould be supported by designing regulations that are guided by the principles of green chemistry13 and\nenable substitution to safer materials (DCCEEW 2024b, p. 18; Wakefield-Rann 2022, p. 12).\nHowever, any new or altered regulations need to balance social, environmental and economic risks and benefits,\nand consider the cost of implementation, as well as any new enforcement requirements for governments.\nUndertaking infrastructure investment evaluation\nInfrastructure development is critical to economic growth and providing essential services that support basic\nhuman needs. Best practice infrastructure development means proceeding with those projects that\ndemonstrate clear societal net benefits. By avoiding projects that do not demonstrate this, governments can\nimprove materials productivity by avoiding unnecessary materials use and wastage (chapter 2).\n9 Hazardous materials include those that are explosive, flammable, poisonous, toxic, ecotoxic or infectious (DCCEEW 2025j).\n10 Chemicals in other uses are regulated by other schemes. Agricultural and veterinary chemicals are regulated by the\nAustralian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, chemicals used in food are regulated by Food Standards Australia\nand New Zealand, and chemicals in medicines are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (AICIS 2025).\n11 For example, state and territory legislation regulates the handling of asbestos prevalent in construction materials.\n12 For example, in December 2024, Environment Ministers agreed to publish an updated PFAS National Environmental\nManagement Plan, complementing the standards established under the Industrial Chemicals Environmental\nManagement Standard which will reduce the environmental impact of PFAS (DCCEEW 2024d, p. 2).\n13 These principles outline a design process to minimise or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous chemicals over\nthe course of the product life cycle (US EPA 2025).\n110", "text_len": 4306, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The PC’s Advancing\nProsperity inquiry recommended governments address the absence or disregard of rigorous cost-benefit\nanalysis in major infrastructure projects (PC 2023a, p. 74).\nIn the National Water Reform inquiry, the PC recommended that the National Water Initiative (NWI) be\nrenewed to ensure water security in the face of ongoing challenges including climate change and growing\nwater demand (PC 2024b, p. 2). While the renewal of the NWI focuses on achieving water security more\ngenerally, it also can support the transition to a circular economy as sustainable, economically efficient\ninvestment in water security factors in the environmental impacts of materials use. The PC recommended\nthe use of frameworks that enable all options to be considered (for example, including demand management,\npurified recycled water and decentralised/modular infrastructure), and that infrastructure is assessed against\nthe criteria that it is economically viable, ecologically sustainable and culturally responsive prior to the\ncommitment of funding (PC 2021a, p. 194, 2024b, pp. 121–122).\n8.2 Ongoing and future opportunities and challenges\nWhile there is significant innovation occurring towards circularity, the areas of reform identified in this inquiry\nreflect the fact that Australia’s transition to a circular economy is in its early stages overall. Generally,\nhouseholds and businesses are aware of the benefits of circular practices but are faced with challenges in\nadopting circular activities (Collins et al. 2023, pp. 23–25; Torres de Oliveira et al. 2021, p. 4). The\nrecommendations in this report are actions that governments can take in the short and medium term to\nreduce barriers and increase uptake of circular activities, and in doing so improve materials productivity.\nHowever, there are future opportunities and risks for the circular economy beyond the scope of the\nrecommendations in this report. As governments implement proposed reforms and look ahead, they will need to\ntake a broader view of what the circular economy encompasses and consider policies and metrics that effectively\nmonitor and manage a wider set of issues (chapter 9). The following sub-sections present some of these broader\nissues, however this is not exhaustive and there will be other areas that governments will need to consider.\nA range of skills will be required\nA well-trained workforce is an important enabler of the circular economy transition. At present and in future, a\nrange of both transferrable and specialised skills are required to develop new circular products and\napproaches, adopt circular innovation and undertake various circular economy activities. Transferable skills,\nas identified in the Circular Economy Ministerial Advisory Group’s final report and Australia’s Circular\nEconomy Framework, include the use of systems and critical thinking, while more specialised skills include\nknowledge of materials flow analysis and sustainable product design (DCCEEW 2024b, p. 28, 2024c, p. 66).\nNewer and broader (multifaceted and versatile) skillsets will be required as the circular economy transition\nprogresses. For example, these will be required in place-based transition brokers (recommendation 7.2) and\nthe personnel engaged to offer facilitation, information and support services to enable circularity in large\ninfrastructure projects (recommendation 2.2) will need to have diverse skillsets to encourage uptake of\ncircular activities within their communities and across industries. Such brokers and facilitators will need to\n111", "text_len": 4002, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The economy-wide nature of the circular economy transition means that policies are not\nisolated to a sector and aim to achieve a range of interconnected environmental, economic and social\nbenefits. This highlights a need for individuals and teams in central agencies and departments to adopt a\ncross-portfolio approach to analyse how circular policies result in flow-on impacts across different parts of the\neconomy, environment and community; assess these different kinds of impacts (not just those that can be\nquantified in conventional monetary terms) to inform decisions; and foster collaboration and coordination\nacross agencies and levels of government, and between governments, industry and community.\nAs circularity within the economy grows, and to drive this growth, demand for these skills will increase.\nHowever, there may be shortages in training or specialist skills that vary by sector (Schandl et al. 2024,\np. 18). Skills gaps in the broader economy can also limit progress of the circular economy transition. For\nexample, the current skills shortage in regional areas may be a barrier to undertaking circular economy\nactivities in these communities, and the current shortage of tradespeople may limit the uptake of circular\neconomy skills that are required to progress circularity in the built environment (Jobs and Skills\nAustralia 2023, pp. 13–14). To ensure that Australia has the skills necessary for a circular economy,\ngovernments should monitor the magnitudes and duration of shortages across various locations, sectors and\ndisciplines, and any future policy action must be targeted at specific skills gaps.\nIntegrated urban planning can improve circularity\nIntegrated urban planning is an important aspect of city and town design and management that is both an\nopportunity and an enabler of the circular economy. It incorporates urban design, transport, housing, health\nand biodiversity in the same planning processes (UNEP 2024b), across decisions about land use, service\ndelivery and civil infrastructure development.\nAs an opportunity, integrated planning can improve materials productivity and environmental outcomes by\nminimising materials use in urban development. The development of the Western Sydney Aerotropolis is an\nexample of integrated planning. The integrated planning of land use and transport will be made possible\nthrough consultation with community and coordination across various levels of government and will ensure\nthat materials use is optimised to meet community transport needs (Western Sydney Planning\nPartnership 2020, pp. 6, 38). Additionally, the integrated planning of water systems with infrastructure will\nprovide a range of benefits including better water cycle management, waterway health and urban heat\nmanagement (Western Sydney Planning Partnership 2020, p. 23). At a precinct scale, integrated planning\nwas used in One Central Park in Sydney. The complex contains a mix of commercial and residential real\nestate as well as a water recycling plant that distributes treated water throughout the complex and to\nneighbouring areas for secondary use.\nMany state and territory governments have stated objectives around integrated planning, including in\ninfrastructure and transport (Infrastructure NSW 2022; SA DHUD 2019, p. 27; VIC DTP 2024a), and urban\nwater planning (NSW DPIE 2021b, p. 123; VIC DELWP 2017, p. 5). However, there can be challenges in its\nimplementation. For example, the PC identified barriers to integrated water management relating to a lack of\nclear objectives, clarity of roles and responsibilities, and communication between the urban planning and\nwater sectors (PC 2020c, p. 40). In undertaking integrated planning, governments should introduce\nmeasures to reduce these challenges to avoid significantly lengthening planning approval timeframes, which\nare already leading to slow development (PC 2025c, pp. 45–46).\n112", "text_len": 4303, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Chapter 7 outlines the benefits and some mechanisms to\nprogress place-based circularity, which may also apply to large-scale regional developments.\nBehaviour change needs to be supported\nInquiry participants identified behaviour change as an important element for the circular economy transition\nwithin their industry and for the circular economy more broadly (ARA, sub. 265, p. 1; BSC, sub. 223 att. 2,\np. 13; CERN APAC, sub. 215, p. 2). Australia’s Circular Economy Framework recognises governments as an\nenabler for the circular economy transition and calls for education initiatives (DCCEEW 2024b, p. 30). State,\nterritory and local governments are already implementing a range of programs which recognise the need for\nand value of support for behaviour change in the transition to greater circularity (section 7.2).14\nHowever, changing household, business and community behaviours and choices (such as reusing or\nrepairing products, or purchasing products better designed for circularity) is a gradual process and requires\nsustained action. To influence behaviour, tailored education and mentoring about the circular economy can\nhelp build capability and understanding of its application in various contexts, and increase engagement with\ncircular activities (ASBFEO, sub. 270, p. 4; GCCN and Sustainability Victoria 2024, p. 8; Roundtable\nparticipants, pers. comm., 29 May 2025).\nGovernments have an important and continuing role in educating Australians to make informed decisions\nand support behaviour change over time. Behaviour change can be directly targeted through initiatives like\nproduct labelling or be an outcome of programs such as product stewardship.\n8.3 Develop an outcomes framework for circular\neconomy reforms\nCircular economy policy in Australia is still in its early stages. For some reform areas, the issues are\nrelatively well known and the supporting evidence base for designing reforms is relatively well developed. In\nthese areas, full implementation should progress. For other reform areas, including those in which future\nopportunities for further policy change arise, governments will need to undertake further work to better\nunderstand how to design policy changes to have the greatest net benefits. Governments should gather\nadditional information to understand and, where possible, quantify the benefits of policy options. This can be\ndone through, for example, life cycle analyses or bespoke impact studies. In some cases, a staged approach\nto policy implementation is preferred to monitor policy implementation or assess how the impacts of recent\ninternational policy actions on supply chains affect Australian markets.\n14 For example, the Victorian Government funded the Gippsland Circular Futures Initiative which improved awareness\nand adoption of circular practices in businesses in the Gippsland region (GCCN and Sustainability Victoria 2024, p. 8).\n113", "text_len": 3288, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This will help\ngovernments implement, monitor and evaluate circular economy reforms.\n• An outcomes framework would create a common strategic vision. It would enable a systematic and\nmission-based approach15 to circular economy policy by ensuring that progress is aligned across\ngovernments and that agencies are clear on what outcomes policies should be achieving. This is\nparticularly important in the circular economy context as reforms are both sector-specific and\ncross-sectoral, meaning roles for implementation, administration and evaluation will be spread across\nvarious levels of government and government departments.\n• An outcomes framework would enable transparency, accountability and ongoing improvements\nfor circular economy policies. By setting out the outcomes that policy actions intend to achieve, an\noutcomes framework would enable parties to identify and collect the data necessary to monitor policy\neffectiveness and make policy improvements over time. This may include developing specific metrics to\nmeasure progress over time (discussed further in chapter 9), as well as filling evidence gaps to strengthen\nthe case for further reform (for example, developing methods to better capture the social, economic and\nenvironmental benefits of government action). The framework also provides a basis for the community to\nhold governments to account on its policy decisions.\nDeveloping the outcomes framework will enable the inclusion of government actions that promote the transition\nto a circular economy. A starting point could be to include, for example, actions from the National Waste Policy,\nactions to end plastic waste and actions recommended in this report. As circular economy policy\nimplementation progresses, the outcomes framework will also support the identification of further priorities and\npolicies to develop. The ultimate scope will depend on the targets and outcomes that are chosen.\nFigure 8.1 presents a stylised outcomes framework. It illustrates how an outcomes framework can be used to\nconnect government policy actions to a range of objectives that promote uptake of circular activities across\nthe product life cycle (such as those relating to circular design, product repair, reuse and recycling), and how\nthese activities contribute to outcomes relating to environmental, economic and social benefits that achieve\nlonger-term circular policy goals (such as those identified in the National Circular Economy Framework).\nAn important element of this framework, and the outcomes framework to be developed by the Australian\nGovernment in future, is the mapping of reforms and outcomes relevant to governments’ commitments under\nthe National Agreement on Closing the Gap. In developing a broader outcomes framework, the Australian\nGovernment must identify, develop and map relevant reforms and outcomes in partnership with Aboriginal\nand Torres Strait Islander organisations. This would help ensure outcomes are valued by Aboriginal and\nTorres Strait Islander communities (PC 2020a, p. 3), and that the valuable traditional knowledge and\ninnovation strengths of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures is incorporated into the framework (First\nNations Economics, sub. 252, p. 14). The extent of integration within the overarching outcomes framework,\nor whether a separate, linked outcomes framework is preferred to embed self-determined outcomes for\nrelevant reforms, needs to be determined by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\n15 A mission-based approach allows policymakers to determine the direction of growth (Mazzucato et al. 2020, p. 421) by\nimplementing policies that will achieve clear and ambitious circular economy goals. Using this approach for Australia’s\ncircular economy transition has been supported by inquiry participants (Monash University, sub. 262, p. 18; RMIT\nUniversity, sub. 212, p. 1).\n114", "text_len": 4132, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Measuring Australia’s circular\nprogress\nKey points\nDeveloping new metrics with greater sectoral detail or coverage of the ‘10Rs’ would enhance policymakers’\nability to track overall progress and evaluate new and emerging circular economy policies.\n• Such metrics could also guide or influence private sector actions, by highlighting where businesses could do\nmore to increase materials productivity and pursue potential areas of market growth.\nThe Australian Government should develop metrics to enable effective monitoring, evaluation and\nreporting of government actions to promote a circular economy. A strategic approach to selecting these\nmetrics relies on governments first developing an overarching policy outcomes framework (chapter 8).\nThe Australian Government should:\n• use an outcomes framework (recommendation 8.2) to identify areas lacking metrics or where data gaps\nexist, such as markets or sectors where there are policies aimed at encouraging businesses to incorporate\ncircular design principles in product design\n• develop a metrics and data collection strategy that prioritises filling key gaps, based on considerations such\nas the significance of the opportunity (in terms of economic and environmental benefits) and the extent to\nwhich existing data systems capture relevant data\n• establish and oversee arrangements for monitoring, evaluation, reporting, and improvement.\nMetrics and indicators1 are key tools to track progress and evaluate whether government policies have met\ntheir desired outcomes. They also help governments monitor longer term progress towards economic,\nenvironmental and social objectives more generally. Indicators and metrics for the circular economy are\nimportant for governments to set policy direction, show progress, identify opportunities, and demonstrate\nimpact (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2024).\nThe terms of reference for this inquiry ask the Productivity Commission to identify metrics to measure\nopportunities and improvements made in Australia’s materials productivity and efficiency.\n1 These terms are often used interchangeably but their meaning can differ depending on context (Better Evaluation 2025). In\nthe context of key performance indicators, an indicator is indirect and requires interpretation and explanation (for example,\nthe circularity rate) whereas a metric is a figure that provides an easily interpreted sign of performance (for example, number\nof patents approved in a year for circular design) (Better Evaluation and ANZSOG 2022, p. 4).\n117\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n9.

The\nCircular Economy Ministerial Advisory Group recommended ‘developing sector-specific transition strategies’\nwhich ‘could include sector-specific targets and focus on priority materials to drive circularity’ (DCCEEW 2024c,\np. 28). The priority sectors identified in Australia’s Circular Economy Framework include industry, built\nenvironment, food and agriculture, and resources sectors (DCCEEW 2024b, p. 6).\nMetrics and indicators currently collected and reported on an ongoing basis by governments have several\nlimitations2 for evaluating whether circular economy policies have met their desired outcomes. For example,\nthese metrics:\n• primarily focus on circular activities that occur at the end of the product life cycle (namely\nrecycling) and do not enable monitoring of activities in consumption (for example reuse, repair, refurbish,\nremanufacture and repurpose) or design (for example refuse, rethink, reduce) phases (box 9.1). This limits\nthe ability of policymakers and businesses to design, implement and understand the effectiveness of\nactions that seek to increase circular economy practices earlier in the product life cycle, such as uptake of\nsustainable product designs\n• tend to focus on materials volumes or weight but do not (generally) capture other environmental (for\nexample carbon, water, biodiversity) or economic impacts, or distinguish between the value (or other\ncharacteristics) of different material types\n• are often highly aggregated which can make them difficult for policymakers or businesses to interpret\nand use. For example, metrics such as Australia’s circularity rate (the proportion of materials used in an\neconomy that are recovered and reintroduced as secondary materials) are reported at the national level to\nenable economy-wide tracking of the transition to a circular economy but that metric does not provide\ninsights into where or how progress has been made\n• lack sectoral detail which may reduce the ability of policymakers or businesses to track the effectiveness of\nmeasures targeting priority sectors (such as those identified under Australia’s Circular Economy Framework) or\nparts of the product life cycle (such as designing for repurpose). For example, the existing waste source\ncategories (municipal solid waste, commercial and industrial, and construction and demolition) were developed\nprior to the National Waste Policy and may not be fit-for-purpose to inform the priority areas identified in\nAustralia’s Circular Economy Framework. Before introducing circularity targets for priority sectors, the\nAustralian Government will need to develop more granular sector-specific metrics to track progress.\nGeneral productivity measures, such as multifactor productivity, also have limitations in capturing changes in\nthe efficiency of materials use (chapter 1).\n2 For example, Coreo (sub. 104, p. 14); Engineers Australia (sub. 108, p. 3); Mathur (sub. 10, p. 1); NSW Government\n(sub. 139, p. 12–13); ResiLoop Ltd (sub. 84, p. 4); Swedish Australian Chamber of Commerce Sustainability Committee\n(sub. 94, p. 2); WALGA (sub. 167, p. 2) and WARRRL (sub. 87, pp. 6–7).\n118", "text_len": 3462, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This will increase the policy relevance of new metrics by\nlinking metrics to desired economic, social and environmental outcomes and policy goals. For example, if the\naim of government action is to increase the use of sustainable materials in infrastructure projects, data and\nreporting on the extent businesses are substituting virgin building materials with sustainable alternatives will\nhelp evaluate the effectiveness of such policies. Also, if a barrier to adoption of circular practices is\nconfidence or knowledge (for example, on how sustainable materials can be used in infrastructure), data\ncollected on changes to these areas over time can help indicate early progress towards innovation uptake.\nFigure 9.1 illustrates how metrics could be mapped to outcomes for recommendation 2.1.\nThe second step would be for the Australian Government, with input from states and territories, to develop a\nmetrics and data collection strategy prioritising new metrics that are of particular interest to policymakers\n(such as metrics relating to sectors with significant material use or environmental impacts) and can be\ncollected at relatively low cost (because there are existing systems for reporting relevant data).

For example, the Green Building\nCouncil of Australia has a voluntary Green Star certification program9 which is recognised as a measure of\nsustainability outcomes under the Australian Government’s Environmental Sustainability Procurement\nPolicy10 and has been working with governments to develop guidance to meet sustainability procurement\nrequirements for the built environment (GBCA 2025; GBCA and GISA 2023).\nTo achieve better policy outcomes, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s values, expertise and lived\nexperiences must be reflected in what is evaluated and how evaluation is undertaken (PC 2020b). Adopting\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-defined measures of success ensures communities have\nownership over defining and measuring outcomes that truly matter to their communities and supports\nself-determination.\nIn line with the principle of centring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, perspectives, priorities and\nknowledges, evaluations of circular economy policies and programs ‘should consider the impacts of the policy\nor program on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at the policy development/early evaluation planning\nstage so that the right evaluation questions are asked and data are collected’ (PC 2020b, p. 23). This means\nusing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander defined measures of success. For example, First Nations\nEconomics (sub. 252, p. 11) notes that conventional MERI frameworks in Australia ‘tend to focus on\nquantitative, economic and environmental metrics’ whereas the ‘literature emphasises that First Nations\npeoples often define and measure “success” differently, using culturally grounded frameworks centred on\nvalues of interdependence, respect for Country, kinship and long-term community well-being’. They emphasise\nthat ‘these holistic paradigms challenge the dominant models of evaluation and offer powerful alternatives that\ncan enrich Australia’s transition to a circular economy’ (First Nations Economics, sub. 252 p. 11).\nMeasures of success will vary by community and should be developed in partnership with Aboriginal and\nTorres Strait Islander communities when MERI frameworks are established. Culturally appropriate evaluation\nmethods support the implementation of Priority Reform 4 of the National Agreement on Closing the Gap, and\n6 European companies’ obligations extended to reporting on a range of environmental factors in 2025 including\nbiodiversity, ecosystems and resource use and the circular economy under the European Corporate Sustainability\nReporting Directive (European Commission 2025a).\n7 For example, B Corp Certification is a designation that a business is meeting standards independently verified on\nperformance, accountability and transparency across the areas of social, environmental and governance impact topic\nareas (B Lab 2025a). There are currently 560 certified B Corporations headquartered in Australia, 74% of which have\nbeen certified in the past five years (B Lab 2025b).\n8 The Kunming-Global Biodiversity Framework calls for businesses to ‘disclose their risks, dependencies and impacts on\nbiodiversity’ (target 15) and identifies the nature-related financial disclosures framework as a key indicator for this target\n(SCBD 2022). Fifteen Australian organisations have committed to making nature-related financial disclosures as of 6 August\n2025 (TNFD 2025).\n9 Certifications increased by more than 80% in the 2022-23 financial year with over 800 certifications issued that year\nand over 4,500 certifications in total (GBCA 2023).\n10 The Australian Government’s Environmental Sustainability Procurement (ESP) Policy aims to stimulate industry\ninvestment and innovation in sustainable goods, where success (for circularity) is the extent to which there is an increase\nin the use of circular economy principles (DCCEEW 2024f, p. 7). The ESP Reporting Framework for Phase 1\n(construction services) requires suppliers to report a minimum of one of the four innovation metric categories of design,\nproducts, materials or processes in meeting the principles (Australian Government 2024b).

A range of significant reforms have already been implemented or are currently\nunderway to facilitate this shift. Whilst businesses, communities and other organisations have been\ninnovating, there remains substantial untapped potential. This report outlines several reforms and policy\nactions to further realise this potential.\nImplementing the recommendations outlined in this report will require a phased approach. As outlined\nelsewhere in this report, the circular economy is a busy policy space, and our approach has been to set out a\ncourse of action that complements and accommodates other work underway. The figures below focus only\non recommendations in this report, but present phased timelines1 to guide implementation for the Australian\nGovernment (figure 10.1), state and territory governments (figure 10.2), and local governments (figure 10.3).\nActions in the timelines are split by those involving implementation (enact and embed) and those involving\nevaluation (evaluate and extend).\nThe phased timelines reflect interdependencies within each reform area. For example, governments need to do\npreparatory work to understand where the greatest opportunities are to amend standards and specifications\nthat restrict sustainable materials use in infrastructure projects. Similarly, the challenge-based grant program\nevaluation can only occur once the program has been in operation for sufficient time (three years).\nThe phased timelines also reflect interdependencies across reform areas. For example, developing an\noutcomes framework (recommendation 8.2) and associated metrics (recommendation 9.1) will enable the\n1 These phased timelines are intended to serve as a guide to implementing the Productivity Commission’s\nrecommendations in this inquiry. They highlight a potential path and timeline to implementation, but the path taken may\ndiffer depending on the priorities, resources and existing policies of state, territory and local governments.\n125\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  |  | \n | Key points |  | \n |  |  | \n |  | Implementing the recommendations outlined in this report will require a phased approach. | \n |  | • This chapter sets out phased implementation timelines for the Australian Government, state and territory | \n |  | governments, and local governments. | \n |  |  | \n |  | A whole-of-economy transition to a circular economy requires sustained and shared commitments | \n |  | across different levels of government and across different portfolios. | \n |  | • Central agency guidance and leadership can, and should, play a key role. | \n |  |  | ", "text_len": 3292, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Similarly, prioritising the\nestablishment of the Circular Economy Regulatory Reform Taskforce (recommendation 7.1) will help\ngovernments progress reforms, such as establishing a nationally consistent approach to product stewardship\nfor small electronics (recommendation 5.1).\nSustained and shared commitments across government\nA whole-of-economy transition to a circular economy will require sustained and shared commitments across\ndifferent levels of government and across different portfolios.\nThe Australian Government will play an increasingly important role in circular economy policy as the focus\nmoves beyond waste reduction and recycling, which are largely the responsibility of state, territory and local\ngovernments. In 2024, the Australian Government committed to Australia’s Circular Economy Framework to\nenable a national circular economy transition. The framework includes a goal of doubling circularity by 2035\nand sets out targets that span the entire product life cycle (DCCEEW 2024b, p. 5). It also provides high level\npolicy direction on how the Australian Government can support this transformation.\nSimilarly, involvement in circular economy policies may need to expand beyond environment portfolios to\ndepartments connected to sectors with significant circular opportunities, such as transport. Central agencies,\nincluding Treasury departments, and Prime Minister/Premier and Cabinet departments, have had varying\ndegrees of involvement in circular economy policy depending on the jurisdiction. Given the broad economic,\nenvironmental and social linkages within a circular economy, additional central agency guidance and\nleadership will be important to engender a whole-of-government approach to circularity. One example of\ncross-portfolio central leadership is the removal of barriers to prefabricated and modular construction through\nTreasury’s work on revitalising national competition policy (The Treasury 2024e, p. 17).\nA whole-of-economy transition to a circular economy will also require involvement and support from ministers\nand departments across a diverse range of portfolios. Coordination and leadership from central agencies will\nhelp create the authorising environment across the Australian, state and territory governments. Specific\nsectors will also need championing by respective portfolio ministers to bring about change.\n126", "text_len": 2517, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
