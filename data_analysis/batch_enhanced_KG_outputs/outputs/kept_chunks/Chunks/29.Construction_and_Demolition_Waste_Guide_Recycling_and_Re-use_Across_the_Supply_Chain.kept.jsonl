High recovery rates for materials are achieved\nwhen materials are captured closer to the source, before there is opportunity for mixing with\nother wastes. This is clearly demonstrated in the case studies, where greatest recycling rates\nare achieved when the waste materials are captured early and segregated.\nTechnological barriers\nThere remain opportunities to recycle and re-use significant volumes of materials that are still\nbeing sent to landfill due to the inability to identify markets for the material as it is presented,\nor due to the lack of technology and/or equipment to sufficiently clean or segregate materials.\nThis is particularly the case with the timber waste stream where there is contamination from\ntreated timber products. There is a clear need for investment in research and development to\novercome technological barriers.\nDesign for deconstruction\nDesigning for deconstruction, a practice that is gaining prominence, offers an opportunity for\ngreater resource recovery at the end of a building’s life. A building that is designed to be taken\napart at the end of its life offers greater opportunities for resource recovery and, with time,\ndesign for deconstruction principles may be applied further up the supply chain to materials and"}

Reclamation rates for high-value\nmaterials, such as metals and hardwood timbers, have also increased.\nMaterial profiles\nThe Australian Government recently carried out a study to determine the status of C&D\nrecycling and re-use in Australia. The following sections detail the opportunities for recycling\nand re-use of C&D materials in Australia.\nThe level of recovery of a material stream and market demand for associated products is\nrelated to geography and pricing. Materials that are heavy and generated in large volumes cost\nmore to dispose of to landfill, especially where there is an appropriate disposal pricing structure,\nwhich may include an associated levy. This results in these materials receiving priority attention\nfor recovery and market development in the C&D sector. These materials, such as metals and\nmasonry, are mostly generated from the commercial demolition sector and civil activities such\nas pavement maintenance or site excavation works.\n12 | Construction and demolition waste guide"}

Nationally, the market for re-use of timber is estimated to be around\n60 000 cubic metres.\nIndications from industry are that the salvage market for reusable timber is generally functioning\nwell due to the potential for high economic returns. A barrier to growing the re-use market is the\nincreasing mechanisation of demolition works (primarily due to time pressures and occupational\nhealth and safety requirements), which makes it more difficult for salvage operations to take\nplace, and increases the potential for high-value timbers to be damaged. Another significant\nsource of salvageable hardwood is ‘infrastructure timber’, such as power poles and railway\nsleepers, for which there is strong demand in landscaping applications.\nPlastics\nThe Plastics and Chemicals Industries Association’s (PACIA) annual recycling survey provides\na useful overview for all sectors, including C&D, for plastics recovery, recycling and market\noutlets.\nThe PACIA report highlights that the construction (or building) sector is one of the key markets\nfor plastics in Australia. The plastics used in construction fall across two distinct categories:\n(i) packaging and (ii) durables (non-packaging). This categorisation of plastics is associated\nwith the life-span of the plastic product.\nEven though there are broad applications for plastic products in construction, as outlined in"}
