{"source_file": "94.Circular-Economy-Impact-Note_Final-for-Publication.pdf", "page_num": 5, "text": "Measuring the circularity of products\nTo inform decision-making and track progress on circular economy, metrics are required to provide\na robust assessment on the circularity of products and businesses. Initiatives around measuring\ncircularity include the Material Circularity Indicator (MCI), developed by the Ellen MacArthur\nFoundation and Granta Design as part of their ‘Circular Indicators’ project. It measures how\nrestorative the material flows of a product or company are and includes complementary indicators\nthat allow additional impacts and risks to be taken into account.\nOther approaches to measuring circularity include the Circular Transition Indicators (CTI), and the\nISO 59020 standard. The CTI, a framework developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable\nDevelopment, assesses material flows against business performance, provides overall resource\noptimisation insights and highlights how circular economy contributes to sustainability goals. The\nISO 59020 framework provides guidance on how to measure circularity performance using circularity\nindicators and complementary methods such as life cycle assessment.\nInfraBuild, in collaboration with Thinkstep-anz, incorporated MCI metrics into steel products covered\nby InfraBuild’s EPDs. The MCI assessment approach considers all materials (including virgin, reused\nand recycled content) and energy used to develop the final product. Accounting for the material’s\nproduction processes, utility, recyclability efficiency and end-of-life characteristics, the MCI provides\nan outcome between 0 and 1, with 1 being highly circular.\nThe benefits identified by InfraBuild on measuring the circularity of products include:\n• Benchmark and understand the circularity of a product and improve that circularity over time.\n• Identify key drivers, impacts and opportunities that influence the MCI result.\n• Improve resource efficiency across the lifecycle of a project.\n• Increase collaboration and industry transparency by providing MCI results through EPDs.\nSource: InfraBuild 2023\nIS Impact Notes - Circular Economy 5", "text_len": 2082, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
