One of the Authority’s functions under the Act is to draft, for the Minister for Environment’s approval, a long term waste\nstrategy for the whole of the State for continuous improvement of waste services, waste avoidance and resource recovery, benchmarked against\nbest practice and targets for waste reduction, resource recovery and the diversion of waste from landfill disposal. This strategy takes a ten year and\nbeyond view and must be reviewed at least every five years. This Strategy was approved by the Minister for Environment and replaces Western\nAustralia’s inaugural waste strategy, Creating the Right Environment, approved and published in 2012.\nDWERDT149455\n192000614", "text_len": 2333, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
