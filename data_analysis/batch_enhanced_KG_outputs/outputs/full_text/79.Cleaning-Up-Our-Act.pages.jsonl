Medium-\nand high-density housing (known as multi-\nunit dwellings, or MUDs) have higher rates of\noccupancy and density, creating new logistical\nchallenges for effective waste management. For\nexample, waste management has often not been\nprioritised leading to not enough storage facilities\nfor bins and limited space for source separation.29\nWithout improvements, MUDs can contribute to\nhigher rates of contamination in recycling, poor\namenity outcomes and traffic hazards.30\n\nSome local councils have proposed that MUDs\nrequire separate and innovative waste services\nthat need to be considered as part of building\nplanning requirements.\n\nSource separation in other countries\nSan Francisco, Slovenia, Scotland and the\nNetherlands all source-separate at least four\ntypes of waste. This is accompanied by a pay-\nas-you-throw system, where consumers are\nencouraged to better separate waste and\nrecycle more.\n\nFor example, San Francisco requires residents\nand businesses to separate recyclables and\ncompostable materials and keep them out of\nlandfill. Building owners and food vendors must\nprovide enough recycling and compost bins. San\nFrancisco residents and businesses pay a flat rate\nbut can reduce costs by opting to reduce their\nlandfill service from a standard 32-gallon bin to\na 20-gallon bin (for residents) or by reducing the\nsize of their landfill bin or frequency of pick-up\n(for businesses). Under this system, San Francisco\nachieved an 80% landfill diversion rate by 2010.\n\nThe Netherlands, Slovenia and Scotland also\ninspect household bins and penalise residents for\nincorrectly sorting their waste.\nLeveraging drop-off points for specific\nor problem wastes\n\nAcross NSW there are 640 Return and Earn\nstations collecting beverage containers and 92\ncommunity recycling centres for problem wastes\nincluding paint, gas bottles, smoke detectors\nand batteries.
