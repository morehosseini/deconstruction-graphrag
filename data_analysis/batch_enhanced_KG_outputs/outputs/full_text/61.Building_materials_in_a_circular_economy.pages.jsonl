{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 7, "text": "Executive summary\nKey points\n• The housing industry is an institution with recognisable ‘rules of the game’\nthat shape industry structure and actor interactions, which in turn will\nshape responses to the development of a circular economy (CE) strategy.\n• Understanding the structure of building-material supply chains is essential\nfor policy development seeking to reduce carbon intensity of new material\nchoice and use in the housing industry.\n• Housing industry engagement with the CE and reducing greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions by relying less on virgin materials and increasing reuse,\nrecycling and resource recovery will require development of efficient and\nresponsive ‘used’ materials markets.\nKey findings\nThere has been limited consideration and engagement with circular economy (CE) principles within the residential\nhousing industry and its material supply chains. A starting point for informing the development of a CE is to analyse\nthe institutional arrangements of material supply chains that supply manufactured building materials containing\nembodied GHG emissions to the residential housing industry. This type of analysis can assist in showing how the\nhousing industry and its supply chains can contribute to reducing GHG emissions by using low-carbon materials\nand relying less on virgin materials. It can also assist by showing how the industry can close loops by reducing\nwaste through reusing, recycling and recovering resources in the industry and its supply chain.\nThe material flow analysis (MFA) found that data for tracking material stocks and flows throughout the residential\nconstruction sector is inadequate. This applies to new and existing materials as they move into the construction\nand demolition waste stream. A novel approach was developed, using top-down available datasets and bottom-up\ngeneration of data. It showed that the use of concrete continues to increase, which is increasing the carbon intensity\nof housing. Further, while the number of houses constructed each year has not changed significantly over the past\n50 years, the size of houses constructed and the changes in materials have significantly increased the carbon\nintensity of new housing. The improved understanding of material flows is important for developing an industry\nCE. The analysis can be extended and improved through the development of better data systems.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 1", "text_len": 2441, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 8, "text": "Executive summary\nAnalysis of two sustainable housing developments in Victoria (The Cape and Nightingale Village) highlighted\nthe challenges facing the introduction of CE. Both case studies examined building design and construction,\nand searched for practices that could be regarded as CE practices. The Cape builders sought to respond to\nCE principles by facilitating stakeholder collaboration in the design, construction and occupation phases. At\nthe Nightingale Village—while the building life cycle was considered—the emphasis was on reducing costs and\nmeeting environmental objectives by reducing material use. These cases highlight the challenges the industry\nfaces. Some changes were easy, such as brick reuse, while others, such as timber reuse, were constrained by\nconcerns about structural integrity. Also, material reuse was constrained because of the lack of onsite storage\nspace between deconstruction and construction. Further, the cost of disassembly and material reuse incurs\ncosts that builders cannot meet on their own.\nThe research found through three case-study analyses of material supply chains—concrete, steel and timber\n—that builders source materials from suppliers without assessing embodied carbon created by manufacture.\nAll three supply chains have local and global features, which means that reducing emissions requires governance\narrangements that span multiple jurisdictions. At a global level, high-emission concrete and steel industries have\ncommitted to staged emission reductions. Their decarbonisation ‘pathways’ will require significant reinvestment\nin plant and equipment, product innovation, and change in design and patterns of use in downstream supply chains.\nTimber use in housing is bifurcated. It continues to be used extensively in detached residential housing. However,\nits proposed use in the multi-unit apartment industry has stalled. Because the proportion of multi-unit apartment\nhousing is increasing, this means that the carbon intensity of housing as a whole is increasing. Material supply-chain\ndecarbonisation and CE development will require close attention to supply-chain institutional arrangements and\ncollaborative reform supported by broader public policy.\nPolicy development options\nImportant policy issues and possible policy responses were identified during the course of the research, which\nfocussed on:\n• mapping and analysing the flow of materials into and out of the housing system, and the availability and quality\nof the necessary data\n• design and onsite decisions about material choice and material reuse for low-rise and multi-unit apartment\nhousing construction\n• the institutional arrangements of manufactured material supply chains that supply materials to housing\nindustry builders.\nThe following areas for policy development were identified, and preliminary ideas for their further development\nare outlined.\n• Materials data collection and analysis: The research identified significant data gaps that need to be filled\nif we are to understand the flow of materials used in housing construction; materials already in the housing\nsystem; construction and disassembly waste; and reuse. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research\nOrganisation (CSIRO) has made considerable progress in the development of a data system with its Australian\nHousing Data Portal. However, further initiatives such as required submission of ‘as-built documentation’ (ABD),\nand use of ‘material passports’ will vastly improve stock in-use and materials tracking. Data should also be\ngeocoded to support analysis at a regional and local scale.\n• Incentivising disassembly and reuse: It is difficult for building-industry stakeholders to economically justify\ndisassembly and reuse. Policy development should focus on incentivising disassembly for material reuse,\nas well as encouraging other ways to reduce embodied energy through material selection and the use of\nlocal products. Creating markets for materials reuse within Australia is important, but as many materials\nand products are imbricated in global supply chains, it is likely that these markets will also be connected to\ninternational markets. It is important to ensure that local building-industry actors seeking to reuse materials\nare not penalised by markets that do not value construction waste.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 2", "text_len": 4388, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The scope of its\nsustainability regulation could be expanded to support the decarbonisation of the housing system. It could\nregulate to require the documentation of embodied carbon in material flows and the reuse of construction\nand demolition waste (CDW). This regulation could be supported by a simple-to-use digital recording system\nthat records the flow of materials into the housing system. Most regulations on recycling and reuse focus on\nend-of-pipe solutions for CE. They should also support better measurement of material flows, as well as reuse,\nrethink, repurpose or remanufacture.\n• Tilting investment flows: Policy makers can shape investment flows in ways that support the decarbonisation in\nthe materials industries. This form of investment, accompanied by regulation, can support the decarbonisation\nof materials manufacturing and stimulate demand for recycled materials. Strategic use of public procurement\nis a complementary form of support. The use of taxation policy can also guide optimisation of resource use across\nmaterials life cycles, from resource taxes on raw materials to tax relief on reuse and repair, and creation of carbon\ncredits to incentivise reduced emissions.\n• Building capacity: Expanding the pool of people with a knowledge of CE is a high priority and requires\ndevelopments in education, training and skills development. This can be done through curriculum development\nfor use in universities and TAFEs, along with professional development in-service training that presents built-\nenvironment embodied carbon and CE concepts. These education and training programs would focus on topics\nsuch as materials manufacturing, material supply chains, materials innovation, construction, maintenance and\ndeconstruction processes, building-industry institutional arrangements and emissions reduction policy.\n• Developing low-carbon supply chains: Building-material supply chains are complex and involve different\nactors that are often uncoordinated and have conflicting interests. They include manufacturers, distributors,\nretailers, regulators, professional consultants, contractors and subcontractors. There is a case for establishing\nhousing industry low-carbon supply-chain councils. Council members would be drawn from industry and\nprofessional associations, along with civil society social movement organisations, including relevant unions.\nEach council, supported by a federal government industry agency, would support a deliberative consultative\nprocess that prepares plans for the development of low-carbon supply chains for the housing industry.\nThe study\nThis research is part of the AHURI Inquiry into housing in a circular economy which asked: How can the transition\nto a circular economy in housing be implemented to provide more sustainable housing? The focus of this project\n(which is one of four projects) presented in this report is on the flow of building materials through supply chains\ninto and out of the residential housing system. These supply chains start with the exploitation of natural resources\nand CO-emitting and other greenhouse-gas-emitting manufacturing industries. The aim of the project was to\n2\nunderstand the following:\n• The structuring and functioning of the material supply chains supplying manufactured building materials\ncontaining embodied GHG emissions to the Australian residential housing industry.\n• How the housing industry can contribute to the CE by reducing GHG emissions through reducing waste by\nreusing, recycling and recovering resources and relying less on virgin materials to close the material flow loop.\nThe context for this research into building-material supply chains is dynamic, as the mitigation of climate change\nhas become increasingly challenging in a globalised society.\nFour features of this context stand out:\n• Global and Australian Government commitments to reducing GHG emissions have increased.\n• Continuing rapid urban development using manufactured building materials is a major contributor to global\nGHG emissions.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 3", "text_len": 4311, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Introduction\n• The Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan at COP27 recognised that\nthe world faces a climate emergency and confirmed that climate change\nrequires urgent action.\n• Continuing rapid urban development using traditional manufactured\nbuilding materials and construction practices is a major contributor\nto global greenhouse-gas emissions.\n• There are inadequate responses to growing volumes of waste across\ndwelling life-cycle stages: its disposal, value, reuse, reprocessing and\nrecycling.\n• The residential housing industry has a limited capacity to create demand\nfor a low-carbon new and reuse building materials market.\n1.1 The research\nThis report is one of four projects examining how the transition to a circular housing economy could be implemented\nto provide sustainable housing. The transition to a circular economy (CE) from a linear ‘take-make-dispose’ economy,\nhas become a widely discussed topic in both academia and industry since its introduction from policy makers such\nas in the European Union (EU 2018). Considering the unsustainable approaches within the sector, academics have\nhighlighted that there is an urgent need to shift into a more sustainable framework, with a focus on implementing\na CE approach (e.g. Munaro, Tavares et al. 2020; Norouzi, Chàfer et al. 2021; Núñez-Cacho, Górecki et al. 2018;\nPanteli, Kylili et al. 2018).\nThe focus of the project is the flow of building materials into and out of the residential housing system. There\nis a temporal element to this research, as new construction adds new materials to the existing stock, while\ndemolition creates a flow of materials out of the stock laid down in previous eras. From a circular perspective,\ndemolition promotes only downcycling, whereas deconstruction retains value and in some cases, upcycling.\nAll of the materials used to construct the existing housing stock are produced by manufacturing industries\nthat emit greenhouse gases (GHG), and new construction is equally—if not more—GHG-intensive.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 5", "text_len": 2073, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Introduction\nThis project understands CE as:\na regenerative system in which resource inputs, waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimised\nby slowing, closing, and narrowing material and energy loops. This can be achieved through long-\nlasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling. (Geissdoerfer,\nSavaget et al. 2017: 759)\nThe aim of the project is to understand the following:\n• The structuring and functioning of the material supply chains supplying manufactured building materials\ncontaining embodied GHG emissions to the Australian residential housing industry.\n• How the housing industry can contribute to the CE by reducing GHG emissions through reducing waste by\nreusing, recycling and recovering resources and relying less on virgin materials to close the material flow loop.\nEach of the four research projects contributing to the wider AHURI Inquiry into housing in a circular economy\nwere guided by five research questions:\n1. Who are the key institutional actors in the supply chain supplying materials for use in the Australian residential\nhousing system?\n2. What supply-side/demand-side drivers can increase the contribution that materials production and distribution\ncan make to a CE?\n3. What are the needs and opportunities for training and Australian jobs in the creation of the materials supply\nchain within a developing CE?\n4. What are the key innovation challenges and opportunities from Industry 4.0 and the use of materials in the\nAustralian residential housing system?\n5. What are the challenges and opportunities—financial, fiscal, regulatory and policy—for material use resulting\nin more sustainable design and build outcomes?\nThis section presents an institutional analysis of the residential housing industry, before discussing the policy\ncontext and challenges. This is followed by an overview of CE and construction industry research and the\nresearch methods applied in this project.\n1.2 The housing industry as an institution\nThe housing industry is an institution, and understanding the housing system requires recognising its ‘rules of the\ngame’. These are the ‘humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction … and structure incentives in\nhuman exchange, whether political, social or economic’ (North 1990: 3). These ‘rules’ will shape actor interactions,\nexchanges and responses throughout the development of a CE strategy. It is important, as the Building Performance\nInstitute Europe (BPIE) argue, to recognise actor groups and their supply chain relationships (De Groote and Lefever\n2016). Further, because innovation in the Australian housing industry is slow and geographically differentiated (Böhme,\nEscribano et al. 2018; Crommelin, Sian et al. 2021; Shergold and Weir 2018) developing and implementing a CE\nstrategy will not be uniform and will take time. This is similar to other countries (GlobalABC/IEA/UNEP 2020).\nA CE housing system will require businesses to coproduce change in the ‘rules’ applied to projects, contracts and\nsubcontracts. How they might coproduce new ‘rules’ can be thought about by recognising that businesses persist\nover time, change and continue to perform. The structure-conduct-performance (SCP) heuristic, used to inform\nresearch into the economics and strategy of industrial organisations (Matyjas 2014; Schmalensee 1987), can help\nunderstand how housing industry and material supply chains businesses might do this.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 6", "text_len": 3519, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Introduction\nStructure refers to variables, such as:\n• buyers and suppliers\n• barriers to entry\n• product differentiation\n• vertical integration\n• industry concentration\n• diversification.\nConduct refers to agentic strategy, such as:\n• strategic planning\n• R&D\n• pricing\n• investment\n• product choice\n• mergers\n• takeovers.\nPerformance refers to measures, including price, profit, efficiency, innovation and product quality.\nSCP research raises questions about the extent to which industry structure determines company outcomes, or\nwhether the conduct of actors matters. Some find in favour of determinist structural explanations. Others argue\nfor more constructivist explanations based on the agentic conduct of actors within businesses. Mosca (2016) argues\nthat conduct is the most important element because it draws attention to firm strategy. ‘It is firms’ conduct that has\nthe pivotal role: it affects both performances and market structures’ (2016: 301). In other words, structure shapes\nstrategy but does not determine strategy, because the conduct, or agency, of people in businesses matters.\nRemembering that agency is possible is important when major industry change, such as CE, is on the agenda.\nThe Australian housing construction industry has a recognisable structure. Recognising the key features of this\nstructure should help in assessing the capacity of industry businesses to strategise and begin coproducing CE\ninitiatives. Two dimensions of this structure are now explored: housing industry arrangements and intermediary\norganisations.\n1.2.1 The housing industry core\nThe core of the Australian housing industry has six defining structural features1. It:\n• has two distinct parts that build different types of housing\n• is dominated by geographically dispersed small builders\n• has low capital intensity (CI)\n• has low market concentration (MC)\n• has low innovation and barriers to entry\n• responds on the demand-side to individual purchasers.\n1 This summation of structural features is drawn from earlier AHURI research (Dalton, Horne, et al. 2013; Dalton, Hurley, et al. 2013;\nOng, Dalton et al. 2017; Rowley and Phibbs 2012) and IBISWorld industry reports (Kelly 2022c, 2022b).\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 7", "text_len": 2273, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Introduction\nThe Australian housing industry has two distinct sectors:\n• the Housing Construction Industry (HCI) produces detached houses\n• the Multi-Unit Apartments And Townhouse Construction Industry (MUATCI) produces multi-unit apartments\nand townhouses.\nThe two sectors produce different physical structures and use different institutional arrangements to design,\nfinance, build and market new dwellings. Further, the spatial distribution of houses and apartments is different.\nMost new houses are built on subdivided land rezoned from rural to urban on the city fringe, whereas most\napartments are built on inner and middle ring land and replace earlier residential, commercial or industrial land\nuses. In recent decades, the share of townhouses and apartments being built, presented as ‘other residential’\nin the ABS data, has increased and the share of houses has decreased (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: ‘Other residential1’ dwelling completions as a proportion of total dwelling completions: actual and linear\nFigure 1: ‘Other residential2’ dwelling completions as a proportion of total dwelling completions: actual and\nlitnreeanrd t:r 1e9n5d5: –19250250– 2020\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\nSource: ABS (2023) 8752.0 Building Activity Australia, Table 37, Number of dwelling unit completions by sector, Australia.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 8\n1 ‘Other residential’ in this series consists of three sub-categories of dwellings that feature in denser forms of housing provision in\nthe inner areas of Australian cities.

Introduction\nBoth dwelling-construction industries are dominated by geographically dispersed small builders and a smaller\nnumber of larger builders. Both use a 3 to 4 per cent cashflow business model to assess and agree contracts:\n• HCI builders work with land developers who subdivide land, provide infrastructure and produce land lots for\nnew houses.\n• MUATCI builders work with developers who own land, design projects and arrange construction loans.\nBoth industries are highly competitive. Builders in both industries rely on skilled trade-based subcontractors,\nwhich may be companies, partnerships or sole traders. They have continuing arrangements with material suppliers,\nland and property developers and financial institutions. Both industries experience volatility due to factors like\nchanging purchaser demand, migration, interest rates, labour availability and government programs.\nIndustry structure can be assessed by focussing on four measures:\n• capital intensity (CI)\n• market concentration (MC)\n• innovation\n• barriers to entry.\nCI measures the relationship between capital stock and wages. Both dwelling-construction sectors have a low\nCI ratio due to the high proportion of resources used to engage skilled labour. MC measures industry competition\nby testing for oligopolies. MC in both dwelling-construction industries is low. Innovation is measured by the uptake\nof patents, software and improved materials and technology. Both HCI and MUATCI sectors are increasing their\nuse of software, but innovation is otherwise low to moderate. Barriers to entry prevent new competitors from\nentering the industry. Barriers to entry in both industries are moderate and stem from government regulatory\nrequirements, including registration, insurances, industry association membership and market conditions.\nIndividual owner-occupiers and private-rental landlord investors purchase most HCI and MUATCI dwellings.\nSocial-housing providers and build-to-rent companies commission or purchase very small numbers of dwellings.\nFirst homeowners buying housing on the urban fringe, often assisted by first homeowner grants, are a significant\nHCI purchaser group (Taylor and Dalton 2015). More recently, first homeowners have become a more significant\nMUATCI purchaser group. Private-rental landlord investors are a significant demand group for MUATCI, but\nless significant for HCI. During the early postwar decades, HCI builders built housing estates for state housing\nauthorities (SHAs) (Howe 1988). From the mid-1980s, social-housing procurement of HCI and MUATCI dwellings\ndeclined and has remained low (Troy 2012).

Introduction\n1.2.2 Intermediaries in the broader field\nIntermediaries are organisations that represent service members, and mediate, translate and transfer knowledge\nbetween actor groups. There are many intermediary organisations advocating for the mitigation of climate change\nby establishing more sustainable socio-technical systems (Ehnert, Egermann et al. 2021; Kivimaa, Boon et al. 2019;\nMoss 2009). In the more prosaic context of the Australian housing industry, three main types of intermediary\norganisations can be identified: industry associations, professional associations, and civil society social movement\norganisations. Table 2 presents a list of intermediary organisations that seek to shape the way the built environment\nis designed, procured and constructed.\nTable 2: Housing industry intermediaries\nIndustry associations Professional associations Civil society social movement organisations\nHousing construction • Australian Institute of Architects • Green Building Council of Australia\n• Housing Industry Association • Planning Institute of Australia (GBCA)\n• Master Builders Association • Engineers Australia • Australian Sustainable Built\nEnvironment Council\n• National Association of Steel-Framed • Australian Institute of Project\nHousing Management • Alternative Technology Association\nLand development • Australian Institute of Building Surveyors • Beyond Zero Emissions\n• Urban Development Institute • Australian Institute of Quantity Surveyors • Renew\nof Australia • Australian Institute of Building • Materials & Embodied Carbon\nLeaders’ Alliance (MECLA)\nConstruction • Building Services Contractors\nAssociation of Australia • Energy Efficiency Council\n• Australian Construction Industry Forum\n• Building Designers Association • Infrastructure Sustainability Council\n• Australian Constructors Association of Australia of Australia (ISCA)\n• Civil Contractors Federation • Facility Management Association • market forces\n• Construction & Mining Equipment of Australia\nIndustry Group\nProperty\n• Property Council of Australia\n• Real Estate Institute of Australia\nSource: Authors\nIndustry associations are member organisations that represent and service businesses. They consult and shape\nthe way members understand their industry, develop strategy, collaborate and compete. Industry associations do\nthis through working groups, committees and conferences, and through establishing endogenous and exogenous\nindustry relationships. Parallel to these collaborative processes, member businesses continue to compete with\neach other. The industry associations that represent the core of the housing industry are the Housing Industry\nAssociation and the Master Builders Association. They both have large memberships that reflect the interests\nof the small number of larger builders and the larger number of small builders and subcontractors that are in\nthe HCI and MUATCI parts of the industry.\nSome national industry associations are members of international associations. This is the case for some material\nmanufacturing industries with global operations supplying materials to Australian residential building businesses.\nNotable materials in this category are steel, aluminium and concrete, which are carbon-intensive materials and\nare produced in Australia by oligopolistic globalised industries (GCCA 2021; IAI 2021; WSA 2021).\nBuilt-environment professionals—including architects, engineers, quantity surveyors and project managers—\nprovide services to both dwelling-construction industries. These people are members of professional associations\nthat contribute to defining and regulating the professional knowledge base, education and training, membership\neligibility and codes of ethics (Larson 2012). Connected to this form of self-governance, some built-environment\nprofessions have committed to mitigating climate change (AIA 2022; Baikie 2021a; EA 2021). For example, Engineers\nAustralia (EA 2021) state that ‘engineers must be at the forefront in policy formulation and decision-making affecting\nthe scoping, planning, design, delivery and operation of systems for climate change mitigation and adaptation’.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 11", "text_len": 4210, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 18, "text": "1. Introduction\nCivil society social movement organisations act as intermediary organisations by advocating on built-environment\nclimate change issues. They can be councils, associations, alliances and institutes. Supported by research, they\ndirect advocacy at companies, financial institutions, industry associations, governments and public sector agencies,\nand press for change in investment and regulation. Some organisations run sustainable buildings voluntary certification\nprograms that are ‘rule regimes that seek improved sustainable building development and use and that provide\nrewards to rule-takers who voluntarily commit to these’ (van der Heijden 2017: 57). Two prominent certification\nschemes are:\n• NABERS—which offers Carbon Neutral Certification for many building types (NABERS 2023)\n• Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA) Green Star Homes rating system for volume home builders—which\nsets a higher standard than that required by the National Construction Code (NCC) star-rating system.\n1.3 Policy context and challenges\n1.3.1 Policy context and challenges\nThe context for this research into building-material supply chains is dynamic, as the mitigation of climate change\nhas become a priority nationally and internationally. Recent COP conferences and multi-state agreements are\nimportant markers of international acknowledgment of the need to act (The Treasury, ND; United Nations 2022).\nNationally, recognition of climate change and mitigation as a policy priority was signalled in June 2022 when the\nAustralian Government lodged an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) with the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change secretariat for a more ambitious GHG reduction target. This is the\ncontext for identifying four policy areas that present challenges for the development of a CE in Australia specifically\nrelated to the residential housing sector.\n• GHG emission reductions\n• Urbanisation and resource use\n• Reducing urban carbon emissions and institutional capacities\n• Regulating for CE.\n1.3.2 GHG emission reductions\nThe revised NDC GHG emission-reduction target was agreed to at a national level and registered at an international\nlevel. It commits to reducing GHG emissions by 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, which is a 15 per cent\nincrease on Australia’s previous 2030 target. Accompanying the new target, the Clean Energy Regulator will be\nrequired to regulate for GHG emissions reductions by companies by increasing the ‘baselines for each facility in\nclose consultation with industry’ (Australian Labor Party 2021). Currently, the National Greenhouse and Energy\nReporting (NGER) Scheme requires companies to be listed if their combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 annual GHG\nemissions are equal to or greater than 50 kt CO equivalence (CO-e) (Clean Energy Regulator 2022). However,\n2 2\nNDCs can only be achieved if the contributions of firms in high-emitting industry sectors are recognised, and\nreduction targets are set and met by these firms. The development of the detailed policy framework for determining\nthese contributions is in progress (DCCEEW 2022).\nGlobally the construction industry is responsible for almost 50 per cent of the worldwide annual resource consumption\n(OECD 2019). In 2011, 37 gigatonnes of non-metallic mineral materials were extracted, with an expected increase\nto 86 gigatonnes by 2060 (Meglin, Kytzia et al. 2022). An average of 1.68 kilograms of construction and demolition\nwaste (CDW) is produced per person per day, which can be used as secondary building material (Kaza, Yao et al. 2018).\nIn 2018, the building and construction sector accounted for 36 per cent of final energy use and 39 per cent of energy\nand process-related CO emissions—11 per cent of which resulted from manufacturing materials and products\n2\nsuch as steel, cement and glass (Circle Economy 2019). This situation is placing the global natural environment\nunder pressure (OECD 2020).\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 12", "text_len": 4021, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 19, "text": "1. Introduction\nIn Australia the construction industry, which includes the housing industry, is also a high-resource use industry, and\nit is important that this resource use and resulting emissions are recognised and mitigated. In 2013, the construction\nsector as a whole was responsible for 18.1 per cent of Australia’s carbon footprint, when using CO-e embodied\n2\nemissions by final demand as the measure (Yu, Wiedmann et al. 2017). Residential building construction contributed\n21.5 Mt CO-e emissions, which formed a 23.7 per cent share of total construction embodied emissions. Buildings\n2\ncontribute to the carbon footprint through their operation, through embodied carbon emissions from materials\nand construction, and through end-of-life or deconstruction (Gosling, Towill et al. 2015).\nCurrently, the embodied carbon from buildings contributes to a 16 per cent share of the whole-of-life building carbon\nemissions (GBCA 2021), with the remainder coming from operational carbon emissions. However, as the grid\ndecarbonises and building energy efficiency improves, the embodied carbon share is expected to grow to 85 per cent\nby 2050 (GBCA and thinkstep-anz 2021: 4), highlighting the importance of lowering the carbon intensity of buildings.\nStrategies such as specifying lower-embodied carbon materials, materials with efficient design, designing for\ndeconstruction and looping of materials and minimising CDW waste following deconstruction will contribute\nto developing a CE housing sector so it contributes proportionately to meeting the Australian 2030 NDC.\n1.3.3 Urbanisation and resource use\nGlobally, urbanisation continues to increase the share of GHG emissions. In 2015, emissions attributed to urban\nareas were estimated to be 25 GtCO-e (about 62% of the global share); and in 2020, 29 GtCO-e (67–72% of the\n2 2\nglobal share) (IPCC 2022). As urban populations grow, the demand for housing will increase. Typically, new housing\nand infrastructure are built with steel, concrete, bricks, asphalt, aluminium, plastic and glass. These materials have\nhigh levels of embodied CO. Timber is also used in housing construction and is recognised as a low-carbon or\n2\ncarbon-negative material. However, the future mix in materials use is uncertain. This focus on urbanisation changes\nthe policy context for material and GHG-producing industries. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC; 2022: 11-6) observed that until recently ‘industry has so far largely been sheltered from the impacts of\nclimate policy and carbon pricing due to concerns for competitiveness and carbon leakage’.\nAustralia follows the broader global trend of continuing urbanisation, and for many decades has been one of the\nmost highly urbanised countries in the world. By 2016, almost 90 per cent of the Australian population lived in urban\nareas. Further, the population is also concentrated in capital cities, which held 67 per cent of the population in 2021\n(ABS 2022a). A key driver of this growth has been immigration. In 2020, 30 per cent of the Australian population of\nnearly 26 million were born overseas. The underlying assumption is that population growth will continue. Infrastructure\nAustralia is working on a forecast that over ‘the next 30 years, Australia will grow by an additional 10 million people’\n(Colacino 2018). More broadly there is consensus that continuing urban growth, especially in the larger capital\ncities, will underpin continued economic growth.\nClosely associated with continued urban growth is the production of CDW. Typically, buildings have a construction,\nretrofit, demolition and redevelopment life cycle which produces CDW. One measure of CDW is dwelling demolitions:\nin the five years to March 2021, 107,294 dwellings were approved for demolition (ABS 2021b). Building demolitions\nproduce CDW that consists of various materials such as concrete, bricks, plaster, timber, wood, glass, metals and\nplastic. In the European Union (EU) CDW accounts for more than a third of all waste. In Australia, approximately\n27m tonnes of CDW per annum is created, which constitutes approximately 44 per cent of all waste. Of this,\napproximately 50,000 tonnes is litter or illegally dumped, 6.3m tonnes goes into landfills, and 18.7m tonnes is\nrecycled into road base (Pickin, Wardle et al. 2020).\nThe challenge is to develop policies that ensure that CDW becomes a resource not waste, as per the CE framing.\nIn Australia, The National Waste Policy Action Plan (NWAP) sets a target for achieving an 80 per cent average\nresource recovery rate from all waste streams; along with increasing the use of recycled content (Australian\nGovernment 2019). Also, the challenge is to ensure that CDW has the highest possible reuse value, so that energy\nconsumed in lower-level reuse is minimised. Too often CDW use is downgraded to recycling or used for energy\ngeneration. However, the impediments to recycling CDW are entrenched. Park and Tucker (2016) nominate four\nmain institutional barriers:\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 13", "text_len": 5069, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Introduction\n• the cost of materials reuse is higher than using new materials\n• the lack of an established market for reuse of CDW materials\n• the institutionalised reluctance to use available technological and practical knowledge to reduce CDW\n• the broad perception that Australia has abundant supplies of natural resources.\nA key feature of rapid urban growth in Australia is the recurring policy consensus that the supply of new housing\nis not responding sufficiently to population growth and household formation. It is evident in the establishment\nof advisory bodies such as the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry (1975–1977) (Milligan and\nTiernan 2011), National Housing Supply Council (2008–2013) and the announced National Housing Supply and\nAffordability Council (Parliament of Australia 2023). It is also evident in recent AHURI research agendas and reports\n(Gilbert, Rowley et al. 2020; Gurran, Rowley et al. 2018; Ong, Dalton et al. 2017; Rowley, Gilbert et al. 2020). More\nrecently, NHFIC (2021) has reported on demand and supply issues. Running alongside the policy focus on housing\nsupply there have been approximately three decades of urban planning policy aimed at densifying inner-city areas\nthat ‘have changed and concentrated population in our cities’ (Coffee, Lange et al. 2016). Figure 1 presents data on the\nincreasing proportion that multi-unit dwellings have formed of all new dwelling completions for the period 1955–2021.\nThis denser housing, the available evidence suggests, is leading to an overall increase in the carbon intensity\nof the housing stock as the proportion of detached housing of total new housing declines and the proportion\nof apartment housing increases. The predominant form is mid-rise and high-rise multi-unit apartments built on\nland cleared of earlier residential, industrial or commercial buildings. A bottom-up modelling study of five housing\ntypes in Victoria—brick veneer, double brick, timber, precast concrete and reinforced concrete—compared the\nOE (heating and cooling energy), embodied energy (EE) and total life-cycle energy (LCE) for each housing type\n(Li, Foliente et al. 2021). Its headline finding was that at the building level, the average EE, OE and LCE intensities\nfor apartments are higher than for the houses (Li, Foliente et al. 2021). This difference was attributed to the\nconstruction type and materials used, as apartments are built from concrete whereas houses are built mainly\nof brick veneer, timber and double brick, which have lower EE intensities than concrete3.\n1.3.4 Reducing urban carbon emissions and institutional capacities\nIf embodied carbon emissions and CE development are to become features of the housing industry, its institutional\narrangements must be recognised. An already noted feature is that the housing industry has two distinct parts—\nHCI and MUATCI—that produce different types of housing with distinct geographies, using different arrangements\nto design, finance, build and market dwellings. Also, both dwelling-construction industries are comprised of a large\nnumber of small builders and a small number of large builders. However, builders build dwellings that are, in the\nmain, not standard products. Another feature is the extensive use of subcontracting, which can be understood as\na way in which builders share, mitigate and shift the many risks that are integral to the design, financing, procuring\nand building of housing (Bosch and Philips 2003; Riazi, Zainuddin et al. 2020). These are the features that have led\nto the dwelling-construction industry being described as a ‘fragmented’.\nEstablishing a housing industry CE in the production of the built environment will require reworking the ‘rules\nof the game’. Three areas stand out for some reworking: material and service supply chains; worker skills and\ncapacities; and digitalisation for sustainability.\n3 It is important to note that sustainability arguments are made for increasing urban housing densities by facilitating multi-unit and high-\nrise apartment development through urban-planning provisions. The arguments typically made in support of densification of housing\nare that it curbs sprawl, reduces GHG emissions by supporting public transport and walkability, improves housing affordability and\nchoice, encourages active streets and social mix, and provides opportunities to apply design standards that create dense desirable\nurban neighbourhoods (Hurley, Taylor et al. 2017). To the extent that urban densification creates these outcomes, it can be argued\nthat a higher EE, EO and LCE can be traded off against other sustainability outcomes.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 14", "text_len": 4713, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Introduction\nMaterial and service supply chains\nIn an era where the policy imperative is to reduce carbon emissions, the redesign of supply chains has become\na research focus (Bressanelli, Perona et al. 2018; Sarkis 2019). This literature advocates for new forms of strategic\nconduct by businesses by ‘looping’ supply chains so that materials and goods are brought back into the forward\nsupply chain. Bressanelli, Perona et al. (2018: 7395) look for ‘challenges that may hamper a supply chain redesign’;\nShi, Zhang et al. (2018) examine the way firms in supply chains shape sustainability outcomes; Rezaei (2019) considers\nhow to develop criteria for selecting suppliers that support sustainability objectives; and Isaksson, Johansson et\nal. (2010) examine the relationship between supply-chain innovation and sustainable development. However, the\nchallenge is how research of this nature might inform the development of housing industry CE strategies.\nSupply chains are systems in which businesses are located, and facilitate the production, procurement and\ndelivery of products and services. A business will typically have upstream connections supplying materials and\nproducts, and downstream businesses receiving outputs. Firms in supply chains vary in size, command over\nresources, and their capacity to change the way they do things. The challenge for the housing industry is to\nconsider how this research might be used, by recognising three key features.\nFirst, builders procure materials and services from businesses in approximately 27 industries (listed in Appendix 4).\nThey do this as they build a house or apartment block by following a procurement script presented in the documentation\nprepared by professionals, which includes designers, architects, engineers and quantity surveyors. Each business\nthat a builder procures from is a participant in a supply chain with distinctive features, and they vary greatly in terms\nof their structure, competition, geography and capital-to-labour cost ratios.\nSecond, there can be pull or demand-side pressures that originate with consumers and their builders, such as\ncertification schemes. For example, the GBCA Green Star Homes Certification scheme based on energy use, health\nand water-use standards. Conceivably this scheme could be expanded to require accounting for embodied carbon\nin materials by requiring other CE measures, such as management of waste, designing for disassembly and use of\nrecycled materials.\nThird, push or supply-side pressures can be exerted along material supply chains by large global companies with\nR&D and innovation capacities. For example, companies in the concrete and steel industries promoting the use of\nEnvironmental Product Declarations (EPDs) that provide environmental data based on the life-cycle assessment\n(LCA) of their materials (BlueScope 2021a; 2021b; Boral Limited 2020).\nWorker skills and capacities\nMovement towards a more resource-efficient and circular economy will change economic activity and patterns\nof employment—particularly in the materials-intensive industries (Laubinger, Lanzi et al. 2020). Inevitably there\nwill be tensions about CE and labour-market change (Dufourmont and Brown 2020). Some of these changes and\ntensions can be assisted by distinguishing two main types of ‘circular’ jobs:\n• Core circular jobs are directly engaged in working with materials and processes such as renewable energy,\nrepair, managing waste and supporting reuse.\n• Enabling circular jobs are engaged in creating and expanding CE though management, designing and\ndigitising (Burger, Stavropoulos et al. 2019).\nIn the materials-intensive industries that currently manufacture new materials, it’s possible that there will be a\ndecline in output and employment. However, this decline could be accompanied by growth in employment that\nextends the life of materials through reuse (Laubinger, Lanzi et al. 2020: 18; Llorente-González and Vence 2020).\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 15", "text_len": 4016, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Introduction\nIt is not clear yet how CE-driven economic and employment change will develop within the Australian housing\nindustry. To date, economic and employment analyses of a shift to CE arrangements—such as those outlined\nin the paragraph above—are economy-wide or high-level sectoral analyses. Nevertheless, the introduction of CE\nwill require labour-market changes in the housing industry and its material supply chains. It will start by identifying\nand implementing measures that may, within an agreed time frame, achieve carbon-reduction targets for new housing\nand major housing retrofits. These measures include:\n• increasing reuse and retention\n• building less and dematerialising building elements\n• building smarter by using lowest carbon building systems and elements and offsite prefabrication\n• sourcing lowest embodied carbon materials from the many industry supply chains (Prasad, Kuru et al. 2021: 38).\nDigitalisation for sustainability\nA significant challenge facing the housing industry, and the construction industry more generally, is the use of\ndigital technology in building construction. This industrial use of technology is often referred to as Industry 4.0.\nThe evidence suggests that the take-up of Industry 4.0 in the construction industry has been partial and slow\n(Hasan, Elmualim et al. 2018; Leviäkangas, Mok Paik et al. 2017; Newman, Edwards et al. 2020; Perera, Jin et al.\n2021). Multiple benefits can be realised through greater use of Industry 4.0 (see Appendix 3), including greater\nrealisation of sustainability objectives (Müller, Kiel et al. 2018). There are two distinct benefits for the construction\nindustry. Industry 4.0 can be used to:\n• measure the carbon footprint of materials and products used to create new buildings or to undertake\nsignificant retrofits (BPIE 2021)\n• create accurate, systematic and easily accessible ‘track and trace’ systems, as well as digital building records\nthat can be used by owners, users and emergency services to find out how their building is constructed and\nwhat utility services have been installed (Shergold and Weir 2018).\nThe EPD system that some material manufacturers have developed is a starting point for measuring the carbon\nfootprint of buildings. When fully developed, it will be able to support a full building-level assessment of embodied\ncarbon. However, two preconditions have to be met before this can be done.\nFirst, there has to be an agreed system for undertaking and registering EPDs. Such a system, albeit a voluntary\nsystem, has been established by EPD Australasia. It registers and publishes EPDs that are verified to ISO 14025.\nBuilding and construction products are assessed against the European standard EN 15804.\nSecond, there has to be a requirement—such as that recommended by Shergold and Weir (2018)—for each\nbuilding to have an up-to-date building manual that contains data including ‘as-built documentation’ (ABD), fire\nsafety system details and maintenance requirements and conditions of building use. However, Perera, Jin et al.\n(2021) found in their research, Digitalisation of Construction, that it is not standard practice for NSW builders to\nproduce and lodge an ABD.\n1.3.5 Regulating for a circular economy\nBuilt-environment regulation in its earliest forms supported broader health, safety and environmental public\npolicy objectives, and the form of Australian cities reflects this history of regulation. It has been accompanied and\nsupported by the development of arrangements between many state and non-state actors. Black (2002: 26–27)\nsums up this way of understanding regulation as a social and cultural product:\nRegulation is an activity that extends beyond the state, thus regulation may on the basis of such a\nconceptualisation embrace a variety of forms of relationship between state, law and society. It thus\nenables the identification, creation and analysis of regulatory arrangements that involve complex\ninteractions between state and non-state actors, and enables each to be identified as both\nregulators and regulatees.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 16", "text_len": 4132, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Introduction\nThe contemporary challenge in Australia is for actors to further develop ways to mitigate climate change through the\nregulation of building construction. In particular, it will require measures that support actors to govern embodied\ncarbon stocks and flows into and out of the housing system. In this way, the housing industry will be required in\nfuture to contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of buildings. However, the current system of building regulation\nhas institutional features that must be acknowledged and worked with if the development of an additional carbon-\nreduction mitigation capacity is to be incorporated into the National Construction Code (NCC).\nIn Australia, building regulation has two key features. First, like much Australian governance, responsibility\nis shared between state and territory governments and the federal government. This system is the outcome\nof a process over many decades where a national government agency, the Australian Building Control Board\n(ABCB 2023), established under an intergovernmental agreement, is responsible for the NCC that provides:\nthe minimum necessary requirements for safety and health; amenity and accessibility, and\nsustainability in the design, construction, performance and liveability of new buildings (and\nnew building work in existing buildings) throughout Australia.\nThe states and territories have flexibility in the implementation of the NCC through their administrative\narrangements.\nSecond, the NCC includes a sustainability objective, which flowed on from when sustainability was included as an\nobjective in the Building Code of Australia, a 2007 iteration of the NCC (Meacham 2016). However, the sustainability\nregulation has been fraught because of housing industry resistance to minimum standards (Crabtree and Hes 2009;\nMoore, Berry et al.2019). From the 1970s, state and territory governments promoted voluntary initiatives on energy\nefficiency, and it was not until 2003 that energy efficiency standards were mandated for houses, and until 2005\nfor multi-residential developments. Subsequently, requirements were increased, and in 2010 the 6-star standard\nwas adopted. In 2022, new NCC standards for energy efficiency, condensation management and liveable housing\ncommenced, which raises the energy star rating from 6 to 7 stars in 2023.\nAlthough limited, research nevertheless shows that the energy efficiency standards required by the NCC have\nchanged the way houses are designed and constructed. There have been energy savings for households in new\nhomes (Berry and Marker 2015). Underpinning this has been the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS)\nsoftware tool used to assess plans and building specifications, which has resulted in better insulation, double-glazed\nwindows, shading, sun-smart dwelling orientation and solar panels.\n1.4 Research methods\nThe research presented in this report was undertaken across three work packages. The methods used in each\nwork package are briefly described.\n1.4.1 Stocks and flows modelling\nThe methodologies used to define, map and estimate built-environment material stocks and flows vary considerably,\nand there are choices to be made about how best to estimate flows. However, Augiseau and Barles (2017) provide\nsome guidance about how to assess these methodologies by arguing that four key concepts can be discerned,\nand recognising them assists in understanding material stocks and flows in and out of the built environment.\nAugiseau and Barles distinguish between ‘bottom-up’ and ‘top-down’ methodologies. Bottom-up analyses start\nby focussing on the way materials circulate or flow at the local level. They do this by analysing existing stocks and\ndifferentiating types of stock and establishing categories. Top-down analyses of material use are undertaken by\nsumming the inflow and outflow of materials by either adding to or subtracting from the estimated stock.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 17", "text_len": 4002, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 24, "text": "1. Introduction\nAugiseau and Barles then distinguish between ‘static’ and ‘dynamic’ analyses. The study of stocks and flows\nalso vary in the way they account for time. Static approaches are limited to short periods of time, and are used to\nproduce snapshot-type analyses. Dynamic analyses use longer time frames and include assumptions about ‘end-\nof-life’. The use of longer time frames and a focus on end-of-life is important for this research, as most housing is\nused over many decades. As a rule of thumb, the average expected lifespan of a house is at least 60 years.\nA mixed-methods approach was used in this research to model residential housing stocks and flows. This involved\nreviewing the modelling literature and identifying data sources that could be used to model residential housing system\nmaterial stocks and flows. Approaches to analyse residential housing materials stocks and flows were reviewed to\nidentify feasible and suitable approaches. Table 3 presents a summary of four commonly used methods.\nTable 3: Main simulation modelling methods used in stock and flow analyses\nTime A system is Abstraction\nMethod treatment modelled as level Example applications\nDiscrete event Dynamic– … a sequence Low Manufacturing, service systems, healthcare, etc.\nsimulation (DES) discrete of operations\nAgent based Dynamic– … interacting Low–high Population, pedestrian, road traffic and epidemiology\nmodelling (ABM) discrete agents modelling.

This requires a high level of abstraction. Hence, discrete event simulation (DES)\nwas judged unsuitable. Agent based modelling (ABM) and system dynamics (SD) were also considered by the research\nteam. However, the use of these techniques was precluded because the data required either does not exist, are\nincomplete or insufficient. A database was required that captures the composition of buildings long-term in order\nto optimise the information flow across the supply chain and to better coordinate supply of and demand for various\nconstruction material. However, it was decided that the available data and additional data that could be derived\nfrom a bottom-up analysis of the stock would support a material flow analysis (MFA).\nMFA systematically assesses flows and stocks of materials within a system defined in space and time. It connects\nthe sources, the pathways, and the intermediate and final sinks of a material. Because of the law of the conservation\nof matter, the results of an MFA can be controlled by a simple material balance comparing all inputs, stocks and\noutputs of processes. It is this characteristic of MFA that makes it attractive as a decision-support tool in resource\nmanagement, waste management and environmental management (Brunner and Rechberger 2016).\nThe required components of an MFA are system boundaries, processes, stocks and flows. First, system boundaries\nare identified, including the material for which the system is quantified, the time interval, and the geographical scope\nof the study. Second, the system variables, comprised of processes, stocks and flows are named and quantified.\nA process is defined where material is transformed, stored or distributed. Stocks, within each process, show the\namount of material or products measured at a point in time. Finally, flows are specified. These flows indicate the\ntransport of material between processes, or coming into the system or going outside the system boundaries. Most\nraw materials used in construction require processing in order to be used by industry (e.g. steel requires iron ore,\ncoking coal, aggregates and additives). The common construction materials used in house construction are presented\nin Table 4.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 18", "text_len": 4313, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

However, by combining the\ntop-down and bottom-up approaches, the research team went beyond the static nature of an MFA to produce\na dynamic simulation and model. They did this by extending the analysis so that it took account of changes in the\ndesign and construction of houses over time, and developing a database incorporating bottom-up field research\ndata. The data were generated from interviews (see Table 6) of a senior quantity surveyor, other construction industry\nprofessionals, and researchers who understood the main historical changes in house design and construction.\nThis bottom-up data on the changing material composition of typical houses over time was integrated with\nstate-specific housing-completion data to get state-aggregate top-down analyses of stocks and flow for houses.\nA list of the databases used are presented in Table 5.

Introduction\nLimitations and exclusions were set during the research so that research results were achieved in the time frame\nrequired. This MFA analysis is a first for Australian housing research. It has been undertaken in a context where\nvery little research and policy attention has been given to the materiality of the housing stock. This gap contrasts\nwith what happens in many other developed countries. For example, in the UK there is a long history of surveying\nhousing stock and the condition of the stock (Department of Communities and Local Government 2017).\nThe main limitations of this research are areas where the MFA could be further extended to improve the\noutcomes of the study. The principal limitations of the MFA are outlined below.\n• It is limited to detached housing construction, and did not include multi-unit apartments and townhouses,\nwhich limited the complexity of the construction typologies and data collection required for analysis.\n• The modelling does not include illegal dwellings and residential alterations and additions. Measured in terms\nof gross fixed capital formation, housing alterations and additions are almost as significant as new housing\n(Dalton, Hurley et al. 2013).\n• It only considers the main structural elements of the house: walls, floor structure, roof and windows. Furnishings,\nfit-out of bathrooms and kitchens, wall and floor coverings and landscaping requirements are all excluded from\nthis research.\n1.4.2 Industry-leading case-study analysis\nQualitative research was used to explore material circularity in two industry-leading case studies. First, a list of\npotential case studies was identified through a search of the grey literature for projects built within the last four\nyears. Keywords used in this search included ‘materials’, ‘circular economy’, built environment’, ‘sustainable’, and\n‘award winning’. The keywords were selected on the assumption that use of these words might demonstrate some\napplication of CE principles. Eighty-two projects, both high-density and low-density, were identified this way, and\nthey were examined for evidence of the application of CE principles and sustainability excellence (e.g. awards,\nhigh-star ratings). Projects that demonstrated good or excellent sustainability design but no evidence of CE\nthinking were deleted.\nThis left six potential projects, five of which were low-density housing, and one was high-density (Nightingale\nVillage). Of the five low-density projects, two were outside the state of Victoria, and were inaccessible due to\nCOVID travel restrictions; they were deleted. The three remaining low-density projects were assessed again for\nevidence of the application of CE thinking in their design and construction. The Cape was ranked first. The project\nmanagers of The Cape and the Nightingale Village agreed to participate, and were confirmed as the low-density\nand multi-unit project case studies for the research.\nThe primary research method was semi-structured interviewing of project directors, architects, project managers\nand consumers (see Appendix 2). A total of 13 interviews were conducted, six from The Cape and seven from\nNightingale Village. These interviews were supplemented with site visits, photographs and document analysis.\nThese visits provided a clearer idea of context and offered an opportunity to ask further questions. The interviews\nwere conducted online in mid to late 2021, using Microsoft Teams due to COVID-19 restrictions. Site visits followed\nin early 2022.\nThe interviews were transcribed, then analysed using NVivo 12. Initial codes were chosen as the researchers\nbecame familiar with the projects and the CE literature. They included ‘building materials’, ‘cost’, ‘design’, ‘building\nperformance’, ‘social sustainability’, ‘vehicles’, ‘end-of-life’, ‘drivers’, ‘challenges’, ‘affordability’ and ‘consumer\ncollaboration’. The initial codes were reviewed by another member of the research team for relevance to building\nmaterials and material circularity. Codes, such as ‘social sustainability’ and ‘vehicles’, with little relevance to material\ncircularity, were removed from the second-stage analysis.\nThe second stage of analysis was guided by drawing on the analytical framework created by Potting, Hekkert et al.\n(2017). The initial codes from the first stage of coding were analysed, including ‘building materials’ and ‘end-of-life’.\nThis identified and categorised examples of CE thinking, including reuse, repurpose, rethink, reduce and recycle.\nThese categories were reviewed and agreed by two members of the research team.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 21", "text_len": 4661, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Introduction\n1.4.3 Supply-chain materials analysis\nThree case-study materials, concrete, steel and timber, were chosen for the analysis of the way institutions shape\nthe flow of building materials into and out of residential housing in-use stocks. A starting point for each building-\nmaterial case study was recognising that each of these materials is manufactured by companies that pursue\nwhat Fleming, Merrett et al. (2004) described as the ‘economics of strategy’. A set of headings used to guide the\nresearch included financing, insurance, standard setting, and regulation, designing and specifying, technological\ninnovation, upstream and downstream supply chain capacities and built-environment governance.\nThe first step was to map the supply chains for concrete, steel and timber using IBIS industry reports. These reports\npresent industry analyses on market characteristics, operating conditions, performance, forecasts and major\nindustry participants. Mapping the supply chains started with identifying the industries that directly supplied housing\nindustry builders with concrete, steel and timber products and associated services. These immediate suppliers\nformed Tier 1, which in turn are connected back to Tier 2 suppliers, and so on to subsequent tiers. These reports\nwere used to develop maps of the three industry supply chains that supply builders (see Section 4).\nThe second step was to conduct 20 semi-structured interviews (see Table 7). Questions were prepared for each\ninterview, usually with five to seven questions, and sent to the participants a few days ahead of the interview (see\nAppendix 2). The interviews lasted between 60 and 120 minutes, sometimes taking two sessions. The interviews\nwere transcribed and analysed using NVivo 12.\nTable 7: Interviews conducted for supply-chain materials analysis\nIndustry Participants interviewed and their role\nConcrete (C) Two participants: consultants\nSteel (S) Three participants: residential steel framer, steel manufacturers, industry association\nrepresentatives, sustainability experts, data managers\nTimber (T) Ten participants: peak body representatives, engineers, developers, builders, economists,\narchitects, sales manager, building managers\nPlumbing (P) One participant: industry association representative\nEnvironmental certification (EC) Four participants: not-for-profit organisation, federal/state government department officers\nSource: Authors\nAdditionally, 15 participants contributed to an online practitioner workshop drawn from key actor groups in\nthe building materials and residential housing sector. All participants were sent a briefing paper that provided\nthe basis for the workshop, which focussed on priorities for CE materials supply, use, and end-of-use chains\nand mechanisms for change. A facilitator conducted the workshop by prompting and inviting participants to\ncontribute, as well as recording responses to questions using an online whiteboard.\nTogether the mapping, literature review and interviewing provided sufficient data for developing and presenting\nan account of the institutional arrangements that shape the manufacture and use of concrete, steel and timber\nin the housing industry, including upcycling or downcycling of waste into secondary materials. This account of\nthe institutional arrangements for the three industries is presented in Section 4.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 22", "text_len": 3437, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Housing materials stocks\nand flows\n• A novel stocks and flows analysis was created by recognising changing\nmaterial composition of housing types over time, informed by ‘bottom-up’\nand ’top-down’ methodologies.\n• Modelling presents analyses of material flows within the residential\nhousing system. However, these analyses and CE opportunities are\nconstrained by current data systems.\n• The data highlights the dominance and growth in the use of concrete\nwithin the housing system.\n• The annual number of houses constructed has not changed significantly,\nalthough growth in house size and change in material composition has\nincreased carbon intensity.\n• Significant gaps in construction and demolition waste (CDW) data have\nbeen identified and must be addressed to inform the development of CE\nin the housing industry.\n• Most construction waste is downcycled at a local or council level. Further\nanalysis is required for local decision-makers.\n2.1 Introduction\nImproving understanding of material flow patterns is complex. For example, a multitude of different construction\nmaterials are interdependent, which means that some raw materials end up in a multitude of different construction\nproducts. At the same time, each construction material is part of its own supply chain or system. The life cycle\nstretches from raw material extraction and materials production, then to the consumption or construction phase,\nthe material in-use phase, and all the way to disposal and recycling. Stock and flow modelling has been identified\nas a method to better understand the dynamics and behaviour pattern within the complex construction-material\nflow system.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 23", "text_len": 1721, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Housing materials stocks\nand flows\nThe question addressed in this chapter is:\nWhat is the in-use stocks and flow of building materials into and out of residential housing?\nHere, ‘in-use stocks’ comprise our existing housing stock, a materials assemblage of embodied energy and\nmaterials. Understanding the in-use stocks of materials can support the planning and implementation of CE\napproaches to construction material—especially when focussing on capacity requirements. CE approaches can\nreduce the flow and impact of materials through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing\nor repurposing, refurbishing and recycling. However, there is no assessment of the ‘in-use stocks’ of Australian\nhousing and materials flowing in and out.\nThe complexity of the residential housing market, combined with limitations on data availability that became\nevident while developing the housing materials MFA model, necessitated the use of multiple assumptions.\nThis was the primary reason for restricting the analysis to detached dwellings only. This is the area where data\navailability was the greatest. It was also the area where the knowledge of older professional practitioners was\ngreatest. However, future research could use the same methodology and develop an MFA of ‘other residential\nhousing’, which covers semi-detached, row or terrace houses, townhouses; apartments; and residential buildings\nnot elsewhere classified. Similar to the work on detached dwellings, it would require the development of a typology\nof apartment types over time and a bottom-up analysis of their forms of construction and material use.\n2.1.1 Material flow analysis\nAs outlined in Section 1, MFA can be used to assess flows and stocks of materials within a system defined in\nspace and time. It is a methodology that connects the sources, pathways and intermediate and final sinks of\na material. This is the context for growth in the use of MFA of construction materials and CDW:\n• Huang, Shi et al. (2013) conducted an MFA for the built environment in China\n• Hashimoto, Tanikawa et al (2007) focussed their efforts on Japan\n• Condeixa, Haddad et al. (2017) investigated residential building stocks in Brazil\n• Zhang, Hu et al. (2021) studied Dutch building stock.\nAn MFA for the residential built environment in Australia has so far not been carried out, although MFAs of\nindividual materials have been undertaken (GBCA 2021; Pickin, Wardle et al. 2020). Stephan and Athanassiadis\n(2017) adopted a similar approach to this study by using a bottom-up approach to quantify the materials stocks\nof buildings in the City of Melbourne.\nA consistent finding across these MFA investigations is that materials output from the economy is smaller than\nmaterials input to the economy, while the overall materials stock within the economy is growing (Bringezu and\nMoriguchi 2003; Brunner and Rechberger 2016). The difference between materials input and output is called\nnet additions to stock (NAS) in the economy-wide MFA (Matthews, Amann et al. 2000), and is considered to be\nadditional potential waste that will be generated in the future. Some MFA studies have also been extrapolated\nto consider the GHG impact of the materials used in the construction industry (Arehart, Pomponi et al. 2022;\nStephan and Athanassiadis 2017).\nIn the housing industry, CDW has become a significant waste stream. In Australia, similar to many other countries,\nthere are initiatives seeking to improve the rates of waste recycling. Due to its heavy weight, low unit economic\nvalue, and legislative and regulatory requirements, CDW is normally managed locally (Meglin, Kytzia et al. 2022;\nWu et al. 2020). Therefore, the use of MFA requires close attention to the geographic scale of analysis so that\nwaste management is governed across the local, regional and central levels.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 24", "text_len": 3917, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Housing materials stocks\nand flows\n2.1.2 Housing data\nHousing industry data from the ABS presents the number of detached house completions per year, along with\nthe average floor area over time (Figure 3). Over the 50-year period 1970–2020, the overall number of detached\ndwellings constructed in Australia has not changed dramatically, although there is periodic variation. However,\nthere has been an increase in the size of houses being constructed. The data available since 1980 reveals an\nincrease in dwelling size until the early 2000s, after which the size levelled out or decreased in some states.\nA breakdown of floor size by state was only available after 2005; prior to this, the variation between states was\nassumed to gradually decrease until they reached the same level as 1980.\nFigure 3: Detached house completions and dwelling average floor area: all states\nSources: ABS (2021b) 8752.0 Building Activity: Table 39 ‘Number of dwelling unit completions by sector, states and territories: original’;\nABS (2021b) 8752.0 Building Activity: Average Floor Area; NHFIC (2020).\n2.1.3 Housing construction and material data\nThe CSIRO Housing Data Portal, based on data extracted from NatHERS certificates over the period 2016–2021,\nsupports a broad analysis of the types of materials and products used in the construction of houses in all state\nand territories. Figure 4 presents a summary of the way materials are combined in the construction systems of\nroofs, walls and floors of dwellings. This figure shows similarities and differences across the states and territories.\nSome differences are associated with designing for different climates, such as the greater use of double-glazed\nwindows in the cooler climates of Tasmania, the ACT and Victoria. Other differences are the result of different\nindustry traditions and preferences across the jurisdictions, such as the almost exclusive use of double-brick\nconstruction in WA.\nThe CSIRO has identified a number of limitations of this dataset because of the design of the forms completed by\nenergy assessors. Nationally, there are four NatHERS-accredited software tools used to assess residential energy\nefficiency and demonstrate compliance with the National Construction Code (NCC). Some of the limitations are\noutlined below.\n• There are gaps in the required information, including requirements to indicate the frame material type and\nnumber of storeys in the house.\n• There is uncertainty about the material and construction-system type because energy assessors can use\nwhatever name they like to describe the construction system using a free text field. This leads to inaccuracies\nand a significant proportion of unknowns.\n• The datasets do not include all new dwellings. The CSIRO estimates that 80 per cent of new residential buildings\nin Australia use NatHERS-accredited software as their means of demonstrating compliance with the NCC.\nHowever, further data from one of the accredited software tools is currently not captured by CSIRO and not\nincluded in the Housing Data Portal.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 25", "text_len": 3118, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Due to the limited waste data available, the stock and flow analysis is restricted to the period 2007–2019.\nFigure 8 indicates that new materials being used in construction are more than double the flow of waste out—which\nshows that the stocks in use of predominantly new or virgin materials are growing rapidly.\nState-based and territory-based stock and flow analyses are shown in Figure 9, which show a similar trend, with\nincreasing material stocks for New South Wales (NSW), Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. The slight\ndecrease in material flow for QLD and WA reflects the decrease in both floor area and the number of constructions\nover the period 2007–20194.\nNew South Wales has a smaller gap between material flow in and waste out, resulting in a flatter increase in\nmaterial stocks, whereas Victoria has a large difference between material flow in and waste out. This is reflected\nin the average waste to construction rate, which in 2019 was 0.27 tonnes per square metre of new construction for\nNSW, and 0.18 tonnes per square metre of new construction for Victoria.

MFA is possible for construction material analysis\nat an aggregate level. However, little transparency is provided in terms of the application of that material and the\npredominant use. For example, the timber industry has overall volume data but would not be able to determine\nhow much of that material is being supplied to the residential housing market (Interviewee 3).

However, the data sheets provided by the construction\nindustry are incomplete, and the accuracy of the data is not fully reflective of the actual build (see Table 9).\nAn additional data gap relates to salvaged and reused materials.

Housing materials stocks\nand flows\n2.4 Policy development implications for materials stocks and flows\nThere are large data gaps that challenge researchers who are seeking to identify and quantify the stocks in use in\nthe residential housing sector. Further, the databases containing relevant data are not connected. Addressing data\ngaps by identifying new data sources and expanding available data that can be used by decision-makers at local,\nregional, state, territory and national levels is essential for the development of a CE within the housing system.\nIt is estimated that concrete and bricks constitute the largest flows of high-carbon construction waste going into\nand coming out of the housing system. Currently this type of CDW is being downcycled and used to supplement\nregional road and railway line infrastructure projects (e.g. roads and railway line ballast). It is unlikely that a high-\nvalue reuse strategy for concrete and bricks, similar to the scrap steel industry, will develop. It is important that\ndata that can be used to make decisions about the best reuse of these heavy carbon-intensive materials is made\navailable for local and regional decision-making.\nClosing data gaps\nIn order to achieve impact in practice, database development is required that captures the material composition\nof buildings long-term through the use of ABD and material passports; this would allow information flows along\nthe supply chain and support better coordination of supply and demand of materials. Also, data on the flow of\nreuse of salvage of materials must be captured so that the nature and extent of circularity is monitored.\nImproving data relevance\nThe research revealed that the housing industry is a fragmented industry. For example, Western Australia continues\nto largely build houses using double brick, whereas brick veneer is the norm in NSW and Victoria. Also, there are big\ndifferences between urban and regional Australia in the use of cladding materials. Data series should be developed\nso that they can be used to reveal the geography of material use in residential housing design and construction.\nImproving data accuracy\nData sources should be triangulated. ABS and CSIRO data provide a basis for top-down analyses of the materiality\nof the residential housing system. This data could be complemented by local council bottom-up data drawn from\nplanning and building permit systems. Similarly CDW data could be drawn from local government landfill and\ndemolition permit systems.\nAccountability and accuracy\nHigher accountability, responsibility and accuracy in the reporting to the CSIRO by the main contractor is required,\nso that more comprehensive and accurate data is available. Mandatory digitalisation of the residential construction\nindustry, through the introduction of lodging of ABD and material passports, would allow for accurate representation\nof stock in-use and tracking of construction materials over the lifespan of the dwellings.\nRegional and local data\nFurther, our research highlights the need for regional and local data. This data will enable local government to track\nmaterial flows and CDW. This will inform the way they contribute to the development of local strategies for the reuse\nof CDW, as well as for the planning of future infrastructure projects and residential developments.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 34", "text_len": 3410, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Sustainable housing and\nmaterial circularity\nIn Australia, the key principles underpinning a CE are often referred to as the ‘3Rs’: reduce, reuse, and recycle.\nPotting, Hekkert et al. (2017) extend these by setting out 10 strategies for a CE. The first and most important\nstrategies relate to smarter manufacturing and product use. These are to:\n• refuse products—such as avoiding plastic packaging\n• rethink—through intensive product use, product-sharing or multi-functional products\n• reduce—by increasing manufacturing efficiency and using fewer natural resources and materials.\nSecond, there are strategies that extend the lifespan of products and parts in both new and existing buildings.\nThese include:\n• reuse products in good condition and fulfilling their original function\n• repair and maintain products\n• refurbish by repairing and updating old products\n• remanufacture by reusing product parts in new products\n• repurpose by using a product, or product parts, in new products.\nThird, there are two least preferred CE strategies that focus on the use of waste. They are:\n• recycle by reprocessing materials to the same or lower-grade quality\n• recover energy by incinerating materials.\nWithin the building sector, recycling is more common than reuse, although the potential economic and\nenvironmental benefits of reuse are believed to be significantly greater (Eberhardt, Birgisdóttir et al. 2019).\n3.2 The Cape: Cape Paterson, Victoria\nAt The Cape, there was an emphasis on minimising material where possible, as well as selecting products that\nwere more natural and less manufactured:\n[We are] trying to minimise the amount of products we’re using … So with a lot of our homes, we\ntry and stick to a minimum two claddings rather than having a whole bunch of different products;\nand [we] particularly tried to steer away from a lot of manufactured products … and try to stick with\nmore natural products. (design and build manager)\nThis reduction of material meant less to recycle at the end of the lifespan. It also helped with reducing waste\nthrough reusing leftover material for other homes:\nThe effect of using less materials in the home reduces that [waste] significantly … So you might\nsee homes that have five or six different claddings on them, there’s going to be a lot of offcut from\nall those different products. Whereas if you’ve just got timber and say, a metal cladding, you’ve got\nmuch less offcuts of those; and you can get your quantities right much easier and not have to buy\nas much product. So that’s definitely a really important factor in doing that. But also, by keeping a\nsimilar tone throughout homes and steering our clients towards similar products, we can reuse any\nleftover material from one job to another. So that certainly helps reduce any waste as well. (design\nand build manager)\nFuture disassembly and reuse was also considered:\nIf we do have to do a demolition, we’re trying to separate all the metals, separate bricks, things like\nthat, and send them off to a better home to be reused, if they can’t be reused on the home itself.\n(design and build manager)\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 37", "text_len": 3178, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For example, timber members in the wall linings\nwould not be reused to structurally support a house in their next life, but could be repurposed to have another\nfunction, such as furniture:\nOne thing we steer away from a little bit in terms of any [wall] linings and things like that is reuse\nof timber, because it’s more from the warranty perspective, because once you take it out of the\nenvironment it’s currently in and put it in a new one it can warp, twist and change. So, we generally\ntry and steer clients towards maybe getting a furniture piece made or something like that from\nthose materials. (design and build manager)\nMaterial selection and choices were made with consideration for the end-of-life:\nWe use corrugated claddings all the time, we know that they can be recycled being a metal\ncladding; and then timber claddings, something that we use predominantly in our homes as\nwell, is a product that can be reused or repurposed down the track. (design and build manager)\nThis included many materials within the home, such as the kitchen benchtops:\nLooking at different types of stones; so rather than the standard, reconstituted stones, we are\nlooking at products like recycled glass, and other recycled products as part of their benchtops\nas well. (design and build manager)\nThis includes materials used around the homes, such as recycled concrete for footpaths:\nWe strongly encouraged low-grade alternatives, low-grade concrete. We use recycled materials\nin our road base, in our concrete, for footpaths and that sort of stuff. (development manager)\nTo assist in achieving circularity goals, there was preference for manufacturers and installers who considered\nrecycling. For example, plaster installers would recycle waste:\nAs the plaster is going on the walls, behind me here, we’ll probably have five or six sheets that have\ncuts and things left over. And the [plaster installers] actually have got a recycling system as part of\ntheir product as well. So, they’ll come in and take any leftovers away and recycle. (design and build\nmanager)\nThere were financial challenges with delivering circularity across the dwelling life cycle. Increased building\ncosts had reduced choice in material selections:\nAnd the other thing is that that’s because building costs are expensive at the moment, that drives\nsome of the material selection that we can use. (building designer)\nAt the end-of-life, there is also a lack of economic incentive to disassemble and reuse or repurpose materials:\nIt’s actually cheaper and easier for a builder to come in and just grab the house and throw it in the\ntip. Basically, instead of someone coming by and then pulling it apart, you know, stick by stick, and\nrecovering stuff. So, you know, the economics of recycling old homes doesn’t stack up financially.\n(building designer)\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 38", "text_len": 3235, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Sustainable housing and\nmaterial circularity\nAs well as financial cost concerns, there were also challenges with building code compliance for new, innovative\nand sustainable products:\nFor manufacturers who are trying to manufacture more sustainable products, it can be really hard\nto get those tried, tested, approved [and] into homes and complying with the NCC. So, I think that’s\nbeen a challenge, because the NCC hasn’t had a focus, or not enough focus, on sustainability aspects\nof the build, as well as giving a bit more freedom to push that bar. (design and build manager)\nWhile there were many examples of circular thinking with building materials, there was also an admission that the\nmain priority was operational energy:\nLook, there is consideration to the whole life cycle, and there is consideration to embodied energy\nand the sustainability of virgin material, and that is discussed in the guidelines. But I think it’s fair to\nsay that our priority is on the operational energy use. (development manager)\nThis was highlighted through the striving for minimum star ratings across The Cape:\nSo the driver was to comfortably achieve the minimum standards that we set in the design\nguidelines, which was 7.5-star energy-efficient, all electric fit-out. (developer)\nTo help achieve this they were required to educate and challenge the builders to work differently from normal:\nWe take them over, like thermal bridging, and how important it is to, to try and stop these breaks.\nAnd just to do a few other things that they normally wouldn’t do, like we showed them how to seal\nthe house right up on the external junctions of a timber frame; we get them to put under-slab\ninsulation in there while they’re building, so that we stopped that thermal bridging; we batten out\na lot of the materials so that we have that air gap outside; and, obviously, sealing up windows and\ndoors, and things like that. (building designer)\n3.3 Nightingale Village: Brunswick, Victoria\nAt Nightingale, there was an approach that focussed on material reduction:\nThere was an ethic about don’t stick anything on that doesn’t need to be there, every surface\nshould be integral. You know, if you shake it and it falls off, it shouldn’t be on the building in the\nfirst place. (urban designer)\nThis approach went against beliefs about what ‘the market’ wanted:\nThat’s the great lesson of The Commons and Nightingale—how much you could avoid unnecessary\ncladdings and finishes that are added to buildings because we think that’s what the market wants\n… we can strip that out. So, there’s certainly an embodied energy component to the removal of\naluminium panel, minimisation of plasterboard, and others. (urban designer)\nArchitecturally, the minimalist design acted as scaffold for residents’ possessions to become the architecture:\nThere was an idea that instead of lavishing the facades with … ‘architecture’, it was better to\ncreate a scaffold for people’s lives that would allow their possessions to become the architecture.\n(urban designer)\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 39", "text_len": 3097, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Sustainable housing and\nmaterial circularity\nThere were some examples of recycled materials, such as recycled brickwork in landscaping areas and timber\nflooring, but this was not delivered at scale:\n[Nightingale Skyhouse] has a recycled timber floor. So that is a hardwood. It’s a 20-millimetre\nproduct, it was recycled before it came to our building. And it’s old-style top-nailed, can be removed\nand reused elsewhere, as it was before it came to this site. And you know, we love doing that. But\nthat’s, that’s unique to that building because it becomes pretty tricky to deliver that at this scale,\nactually, to do with supply chain, there’s not that much recycled timber flooring out there since we\ndid it. (architecture and sustainability director)\nThough there were challenges preventing more widespread reuse of materials, such as cost and storage:\nOne of the big barriers to material reuse onsite, even for Nightingale, is logistics and storage. So\nNightingale sells their bricks to a yard and Kensington [Assemble Housing] buys them back from\nsomewhere else because they can’t pay the cost of rent during that time. (urban designer)\nThere was also an acknowledgment that materials were not particularly selected for their ability to be reused\nor repurposed at the end-of-life:\nI wouldn’t say there is a material in there that is specifically innovative when it comes to circular\neconomy by intent. I think it’s a timing thing, right? Like, if you look at European Commission,\ncircular economy sort of guidelines that were being written in 2014, people have only just started\ntalking about them in Australia in about the last three years. So it’s sort of, I think, at the time,\nit wasn’t something that was as high priority, I was certainly familiar at the time with design for\ndisassembly as a principal. (urban designer)\nBetween buildings, there was also a focus on material reduction:\nThere’s kind of not a lot of materials in between spaces. It’s kind of pretty much the rule buildings.\nWe’ve got no ceilings, and we just got the pavers. So from my building, no, I don’t know anyone\nelse’s intimately. But no, I suppose it’s almost like, return back to that idea of being [reductionist]\nrather than recycled. (architect)\nOne of the main drivers for the reductionist approach was financial cost:\nI would actually say that the buildings have become much more bare bones through the process,\nlargely because of cost. But I think that was our ambition at the start, anyway, was not to be too\nlavish. (urban designer)\nBeing innovative with material choices was also challenging within the medium-residential space, as builders\nwould price-penalty materials that they viewed as risky:\nI think this is where the rubber hits the road with the problem with circular economy principles. We\nare all price-takers in designing construct contracts with builders. So, Nightingale can have any\naspiration it wants, but whoever is building the building, they will name a price, they will name the\nterms, and they’ll price the risk. And as long as a builder sees certain materials systems as risky,\nthey are just going to put a relatively arbitrary price on that as a penalty. Because of the nature\nof you know … you could call it economic theory, you could call it a cartel effect of the building\nindustries. Having this command, particularly of materials such as precast concrete, that really\nartificially penalises other materials that might be more suited to achieving the things we need.\n(urban designer)\nThe land value and scale meant medium-residential villages appeared to have greater challenges related\nto financial costs in obtaining the sustainable design they desired. This reduced material choices away from\nmore sustainably desirable materials such as timber, and towards cost-effective materials such as concrete.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 40", "text_len": 3895, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The Park Life Nightingale Village\ncase study focussed more on reduction, while The Cape appeared to focus more on strategies that included\nmaterials reduction, but also refuse, reuse, rethink and repurpose.\nEnergy efficiency is mandated within the NCC, but as yet there are no requirements to measure and reduce the\ncarbon footprint of buildings. Policies that could contribute to reducing embodied energy include the following.\nIncentivising disassembly\nThe findings revealed that it was difficult for developers and builders to justify the costs of disassembly of existing\nbuildings as the cost of disposing of materials in landfill is less. There is an opportunity for policy to encourage\ndisassembly and material reuse by linking these practices to a broader reduction strategy, which would reduce\nbuilt-environment embodied carbon.\nFacilitating practical disassembly challenges\nRegulations on recycling and reuse, such as ‘Recycled First’ in Victoria, tend to focus on the ‘end-of-pipe\nsolutions’ as a means for encouraging CE.

For example, regulations could support the stockpiling of disassembled\nconstruction materials suitable for reuse.\nChanging work practices through training for energy efficiency and CE\nContractors at The Cape were educated and challenged to change their work practices to build more energy-\nefficient buildings, and to test for energy efficiency by blower door testing6 the houses upon completion.\n6 Blower door testing is a method to verify air tightness in construction, which quantifies the amount of air leakage.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 42", "text_len": 1916, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

They can be mapped using the IBISWorld Industry Research Reports, starting with the HCI and MUATCI\nsectors within the ANZSIC Construction Division (Kelly 2022b, 2022a). Because residential building projects are\ntime-limited, one-off projects, these supply chains are being continuously dismantled and remade. Our mapping\nestablished that 27 industries deliver products and services to a residential building site where a house or apartment\nbuilding is being constructed (see Appendix 4).\nThe question addressed in Section 4 is:\nWhat are the prospects for reforming material supply chains so that they increase their\ncapacity to contribute to a CE?\nTo answer this question, we examined three case-study building materials: concrete, steel and timber. These\nmaterials have been layered into the housing stock over many years, and continue to be used in construction\nby the HCI and MUATCI builders to build new housing and to retrofit and maintain existing stock.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 43", "text_len": 1867, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 50, "text": "4. Material supply chains\nand actors\nEach material was examined by focussing on four themes:\n1. Embodied carbon: carbon emissions associated with the provision of raw materials, materials manufacture\nand use in building construction—including transport.\n2. Industry structure: industries have distinctive features and characters evident in the size of businesses,\ncapital intensity of businesses, competition and geography.\n3. Innovation: change in business practices, processes, techniques, products and services brought about\nby using knowledge and skills.\n4. Industry challenges: substantive issues require innovation and technical change, along with institutional\nchange in pursuit of decarbonisation.\nThese materials were chosen as case studies for three reasons. First, ‘globally, cement and steel are two of the\nmost important sources of material-related emissions in construction’ (Adams, Burrows et al. 2019: 24) and\n‘reinforced concrete and steel frames underpin most of today’s global buildings construction’ (IEA 2019: 54).\nSecond, phasing out the use of these materials is not a realistic option, given the habitus of centuries of concrete\nand steel use. Instead, decarbonisation of material production and smarter material use and reuse has become\nthe focus.\nThird, timber can be used as a structural material and, at least in part, could replace the use of concrete and\nsteel. Some argue that growing trees sequesters atmospheric CO, which means that growing trees and using\n2\nstructural timber buildings can act as carbon sinks (Churkina, Organschi et al. 2020).\nEmbodied-energy (EE) intensity, which is the combination of material quantity and EE coefficient of materials,\nis highly uneven across the housing system. According to Li, Foliente et al. (2021), housing typologies should be\nconsidered when analysing the life-cycle energy of residential buildings. Such analysis would typically include\nhousing type, construction type and year. Materials are part of the equation as they have different EE levels and\ncontribute differently to energy use, depending on building characteristics.\nSix main materials contribute to residential EE: concrete, timber, brick, steel, plasterboard and carpet (Li, Foliente\net al. 2021). The level of EE contribution is influenced by time, as the service life of some materials in older dwellings—\nsuch as carpet and plasterboard—is shorter than others in new housing, which results in higher recurrent energy.\nHousing type also matters, as apartment EE intensities are higher than houses by nearly 20 per cent. Timber has\nthe lowest EE intensity of the three materials, whereas reinforced concrete has the highest (Li, Foliente et al. 2021).\nLess material is required for timber housing, whereas reinforced concrete apartments require large quantities of\nconcrete and steel with high EE coefficients (Li, Foliente et al. 2021).\n4.2 Concrete\nResidential housing construction uses 30 per cent of Australian concrete (VDZ 2021: 9). However, the resulting\ncarbon intensity of the two main housing types (HCI and MUATCI) is different. Apartments are 18 per cent more\ncarbon-intensive than houses. This is because ‘apartments are mainly constructed of concrete, whereas houses\nare typically built of brick veneer, timber, and double brick’ (Li, Foliente et al. 2021: 8). Although there has been\nsome decarbonisation of concrete in recent years—approximately 20 per cent—with further decarbonisation\na prospect, there is a problem: overall, the carbon intensity of residential housing has been increasing.\nThe origin of this problem is found in urban and housing policies supporting the densification of suburban\nmetropolitan capital cities, which result in an increase in the construction of new apartments. The successful\nimplementation of this policy is evident in Figure 1, which shows the changing mix of new housing construction.\nThe proportion of detached houses has decreased, while the proportion of apartments has increased. An\nunintended consequence of densification policy has been an increase in the carbon intensity of the Australian\nhousing stock. This is likely to continue, perhaps mitigated by further decarbonisation of cement and concrete\nmanufacture, design and use of lighter-weight concrete structures or use of alternative materials that are less\ncarbon-intensive.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 44", "text_len": 4405, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Material supply chains\nand actors\n4.2.1 Carbon in concrete\nIn 2018, the cement industry produced about 7 per cent of global CO emissions, and was the third-largest\n2\nindustrial energy consumer (IEA 2018). The industry has improved the energy efficiency of cement production\nand reduced its carbon emissions since 2009 (IEA 2018), and there are commitments from the cement industry\nat the global level to continue this improvement (GCCA 2021). However, the production and use of cement has\nbeen increasing and global cement consumption is projected to increase by 12–23 per cent by 2050. In Australia\ncement and lime industry production is one of the highest emitters of CO (Kelly 2021a: 47).\n2\nGlobally, the industry began planning for decarbonisation in 1999, when the World Business Council for\nSustainable Development (WBCSD) commissioned a report Toward a Sustainable Cement Industry (Battelle\nMemorial Institute 2002). This led to the formation of the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) and publication of\nthe Agenda for Action (WBCSD 2003). In 2018, the CSI spun off from the WBCSD to become the Global Cement\nand Concrete Association (GCCA).\nThe GCCA is the principal association at the global level (GCCA 2021). It commits to percentage reductions in\nCO emissions to be obtained across the manufacturing and use of cement and concrete. National industry\n2\nassociations are using the GCCA framework in country-specific decarbonisation roadmaps.\nThe NGO Beyond Zero Emissions (2017) was the first organisation in Australia to put cement GHG emissions on\nthe agenda. Formal industry engagement with climate change followed when Cement Concrete and Aggregates\nAustralia (CCAA) joined GCCA in late 2019. Industry leaders recognised that the industry was ‘being left out of\nAustralian conversations [about climate change], especially at a national level’ and that decarbonisation documents\nwere ‘appearing around the world’ (Participant C2).\nFurther, larger cement manufacturers were listed in the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER)\nScheme7 (Clean Energy Regulator 2022). Policy will be updated following the 2022 change of government through\na commitment to require the Clean Energy Regulator ‘to determine revised baselines for each facility in close\nconsultation with industry’ (Australian Labor Party 2021).\nIn 2020, industry leaders responded by commissioning an Australian decarbonisation pathways report that\ncommitted to net zero emissions by 2050, prepared by VDZ (2021). In the ‘lead up to COP26’ it was conceived\nof as ‘an outward-looking document […] endorsed by the cement and concrete industry … [as] previously you\ndidn’t have anything of that detail in the public domain’ (Participant C2).\nBeyond the two lead industry associations, the Cement Industry Federation (CIF) and CCAA, contributions to cement\ndecarbonisation through the supply chain are uneven. Larger manufacturers have developed some capacity. As\nParticipant C2 notes, ‘it’s only really Boral, Holcim, Hanson, Adbri, and maybe one or two of the next level down\n[…] the big guys do that because they have the resources to be able to take part in this’. Although there are signs\nthat ‘some larger Tier 2s are developing responses to both this [decarbonisation] and the market pull that has to\nhappen to get this happening’.\nDecarbonisation is primarily a ‘big guys’ responsibility, as they produce lime which produces CO emissions.\n2\nLimestone (CaO3) is the main ingredient, which is ‘calcinated’ in high-temperature rotary kilns to produce calcium\noxide or lime (CaO) plus CO emissions. This calcination process produces approximately 55 per cent of total cement\n2\nand concrete CO emissions in five integrated cement plants that supply 60 per cent of Australian cement. The\n2\nother 40 per cent is manufactured from imported clinker and milled into cement.\n7 The National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER Act) is the national framework legislation for reporting and disseminating\ncompany information about greenhouse gas emissions, energy production, energy consumption and other information specified under\nNGER legislation.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 45", "text_len": 4210, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 52, "text": "4. Material supply chains\nand actors\nCement from both sources contributes the largest total of industry emissions. Participant C2 describes the\nconcentration of embodied carbon created by calcination in cement manufacturing: ‘Cement is about 12 per cent\nof the mass of a cubic metre of concrete, but it’s actually about 88 per cent of the carbon load of a cubic metre of\nconcrete’. Another three types of emissions contribute to total emissions:\n• 26 per cent are fuel-based emissions created through heating the kiln\n• 12 per cent are indirect emissions from electrical energy usage\n• 7 per cent are from transporting cement and concrete to the customer (VDZ 2021).\n4.2.2 Concrete industry structure\nFollowing significant industry restructuring, there has been a reduction of cement manufacturing plants from 13\nin the late 1990s to five in 2022. These five plants are owned and operated by three industry groups. In 2018–19,\nthese five plants produced 5.6 million tonnes of clinker. Also, lower-cost manufactured clinker is imported from\nJapan, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and China. The volume of imported clinker has risen steadily, and in 2018–19\nwas 4.1 million tonnes. This clinker is manufactured into cement at 14 grinding plants owned by seven companies\n(VDZ 2021; Kelly 2021a).\nThe structure of the cement and lime manufacturing industry can be understood by focussing on three dimensions:\nconcentration, vertical integration and capital intensity.\nIndustry concentration\nIndustry concentration in the cement and lime manufacturing industry is moderate (Kelly 2021). This is evident\nin the 39.4 per cent market share (MS) of industry revenue flowing to the three main manufacturing groups:\n• Adbri (MS 19.4%)\n• Cement Australia Holdings (MS 11.5%)\n• Boral Limited (MS 8.5%).\nThese manufacturing groups also make the industry highly globalised, with approximately two-thirds of productive\ncapacity in foreign ownership (Kelly 2020: 29). Smaller businesses largely focus on particular products, such as\nsmall-scale lime production, specialty cements and precast products, and often relate to regional markets or raw\nmaterial quarries.\nVertical integration\nIndustry concentration is closely associated with vertical integration. It extends back to raw material supplies in the\nTier 2 gravel and sand quarrying industry, where subsidiary companies of the three main groups have a 70 per cent\nmarket share medium-level concentration (see Figure 14). Similarly, manufacturers obtain materials from rock,\nlimestone and the clay-mining industry, which has a 26 per cent MS concentration. Vertical integration also extends\nforward into the Tier 1 ready-mixed concrete manufacturing industry, which consists of approximately 1,500 geographically\ndistributed batching plants. These plants prepare and transport aggregates to building and construction sites. This\nindustry has a medium-level (66%) MS where four large vertically integrated multi-plant firms, which account for\nover two-thirds of annual industry revenue (Kelly 2021b: 9).\nConcentration and vertical integration can create conditions for price-fixing and market sharing (ACCC 2022). But,\nat the same time, concentration and vertical integration also have the potential for developing and implementing\ndecarbonisation strategies. Participant C2 explains that strategies ‘can be set at a company level, or cost-linked\ncompanies with political integration, where they can track carbon emissions more easily’. Also, they have ‘access\nto sustainability personnel, they also run to lesser extent their own R&D facilities. It’s easier to get capital because\nof this size. They have more options […] in terms of R&D.’ They also have better access to international networks\nand can ‘keep track of what’s happening in the US and Europe’.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 46", "text_len": 3864, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Material supply chains\nand actors\nCapital intensity\nIncreasing capital intensity (CI) is the ratio of capital investment to wages. CI has accompanied industry\nconcentration and vertical integration across the three main groups. All of the companies in the three groups\nacross raw material supplies, clinker and cement manufacturing and ready-mixed concrete manufacturing have\ninvested in more technologically advanced plant and equipment. Plants have also been closed. This restructuring\nhas supported considerable increases in labour productivity.\n4.2.3 Concrete innovation\nInnovation has been linked to reducing CO2 emissions along the supply chain, from raw material mining to completed\nconcrete structures, which is evident from the VDZ (2021) industry report. CO2 reduction ‘assumptions are provided\nto demonstrate the important role the pathways can play across the Australian cement and concrete value chain’\nfor the period 2020–2050 (VDZ 2021:3). Eight pathways are nominated (VDZ 2021:8):\n• zero emission electricity and transport (reduce by 14%)\n• design and construction innovation (reduce by 21%)\n• concrete innovation (reduce by 10%)\n• increase use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in concrete (reduce by 3%)\n• new CO-efficient cements (reduce by 7%)\n2\n• alternative fuels and green hydrogen (reduce by 6%)\n• measure concrete take-up of CO (reduce by 6%)\n2\n• capture remaining CO (reduce by 33%).\n2\nOther initiatives indicate work on innovation, through academic research, professional association reports and\ndeclarations, company reports and ventures focussing on practices, processes, techniques, products and services.\nIn Australia there is new investment in R&D through the CSIRO and universities, as well as through cooperative\nresearch centres (CRCs), including:\n• Heavy Industry Low-carbon Transition CRC\n• Race for 2030 CRC\n• Smart Crete CRC\n• CO CRC.\n2\nThese CRCs are linked to similar extensive European and US initiatives. The VDZ report (2021: 33) identifies\n10 areas for future R&D priorities and projects linked to current national and international R&D. Similarly, the\nGCCA (2021: 18) advocates in a global context for ‘R&D and innovation through public funding and risk sharing\ninvestment mechanisms’.\nThe concrete industry also recognises that there is more to innovation than R&D (VDZ 2021). First, there is an\ninterest in industry policy support for decarbonising cement and concrete manufacturing and international\ncompetitiveness. Carbon pricing policy is not referred to by VDZ (2021). In contrast, the GCCA (2021: 18) includes\ncarbon pricing in its policy framework by noting that ‘carbon pricing schemes exist in many regions of the world,\nand several of these cover the cement industry’ and ‘supports the use of market-based carbon pricing to incentivise\ndecarbonisation at the lowest cost’.\nSecond, producing net zero CO cement and concrete requires the cooperation of actors along the supply chain.\n2\nSimilarly, the GCCA (2021: 18) recognises the importance of cooperation by proposing to establish ‘climate innovation\nhubs which foster the participation of all relevant stakeholder groups’.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 47", "text_len": 3220, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Material supply chains\nand actors\nEstablishing actor group agreement along the supply chain will require different drivers, as the interests and\ncapacities of the actor groups that constitute that supply chain differ. For example, clinker producers have the\npotential to make savings by investing in technologically advanced plant and equipment, and they could make\nsavings by reducing emissions if carbon pricing applies. However other actor groups such as building contractors\nand built-environment professionals, which are loosely coupled, have different access to resources and respond\nto different incentives (Dorée and Holmen 2010; Dubois and Gadde 2002).\n4.2.4 Concrete industry institutional challenges\nIt is clear from the wider information that the leadership of the cement and concrete industry recognises that\ndecarbonisation is required. Accordingly, there is broad agreement on the types of measures required to decarbonise\nthe manufacture of cement and concrete aggregates:\n• more efficient use of cement and concrete\n• decarbonise cement and concrete production\n• reuse of waste and use of industrial wastes from other industries\n• decarbonise production and transport energy use\n• carbon capture and storage (CCS).\nSix institutional challenges are identified and briefly discussed below.\nConstruction professionals\nIncreasing the demand for lower-carbon concrete in the construction industry depends on the professionals\ninvolved in the design, specification and construction of buildings. They need to know how to design efficient\nstructures and specify lower-carbon aggregates. There is evidence that professionals act conservatively because\nthey have not been trained to design and specify low-carbon concretes (ICE 2022).\nSimilarly Lehne and Preston (2018: iv) and Giesekam, Barrett et al (2015) observe that architects, clients,\nstructural engineers and contractors are cautious about using novel building materials, which could suggest\nthat the workforce is not sufficiently prepared to shift practices. An insider observes that there is a similar\nproblem in the Australian industry:\n[The industry] tends to import technical people to fill a gap rather than develop their own.\nBut there is certainly a need to attend to skill development because it’s one of the planks\nof a decarbonisation strategy. (Participant C2)\nA strategy proposed by the International Energy Agency (IEA 2018: 52) in a response to the lack of knowledge and\nexpertise in the industry is to work with universities to ‘train engineers and contractors to use different types of\ncement and to get a better understanding of sustainability issues related to building materials’.\nStandards and regulations\nIn the cement and concrete industry, the primary standard is AS 3600:2018 Concrete Structures. It sets minimum\nrequirements for the design and construction of concrete building structures. Its provisions are supported by\nreferences to another 46 standards.\nGlobally, there is considerable debate about future standards development. Key issues slowing progress in\ndevelopment relate to the prescriptive nature of the standards, as they:\n• require use of familiar and accepted high-carbon cement and concrete recipes for particular applications\n• reduce producer product innovation and competition, and reduce price competition\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 48", "text_len": 3393, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 55, "text": "4. Material supply chains\nand actors\n• require testing new recipes and applications using prescribed but inappropriate tests that take time\n• require revision, but take a long time for the interests represented on the standards committees to research\nissues, discuss and compromise (Favier, De Wolf et al. 2018; Habert, Miller et al. 2020; Lehne and Preston 2018).\nIn Australia, the way the standard governs industry behaviour is a problem:\nWe are sitting here with a national construction code and a derivative set of standards that do not\nallow these [new cement and concrete] materials to be used. If you want to use these materials\nthat’s all fine. But, sorry guys, you’re carrying the risk … Risk escalates cost in the construction\nindustry and precludes against using these materials. (Participant C2)\nBut change is on the horizon. Since 2018, the AS3600 standards committee has had a subcommittee working\non a technical specification for lower-carbon cement and concrete products and structures. However, when the\nnew specification does become a part of the standard it ‘won’t fully solve the risk issue, because there will be a\ncontinuing perception of risk, but it will minimise it and perhaps will support greater use of these new materials’\n(Participant C2).\nMarket for low-carbon concrete\nA market for low-carbon concrete (LCC) has begun to develop. For example, Boral offers three low-carbon LCCs:\nEnvirocrete, Envirocrete Plus and ENVISIA. There is no publicly available data on the volume of LCCs in this small\nbut emerging market. The question then becomes: how can this market be encouraged to grow? Two institutional\nfeatures of the cement and concrete supply chain suggest there are two areas for action.\nFirst, as already noted, the cement and concrete industry globally and in Australia is dominated by a small number\nof large companies. One of these is an overseas global company. Globally, international companies account for\napproximately a third of global cement production. This concentration of ownership in Australia and globally presents\nan opportunity for driving a broader decarbonisation agenda. Lehne and Preston (2018: 40) argue that ‘the concentration\nof the global cement market means that a handful of major producers have particular agenda-setting power’.\nEvidence of this power was apparent when business leaders of 10 global cement companies signed off on the first\nagenda for action in 2003 and formed the CSI which later became the GCCA (WBCSD 2003; GCCA 2021). Beyond\nagenda-setting, ‘these firms have the resources to interact with standards committees and other institutions that\nset guidelines; they are therefore in a good position to help create and maintain norms and regulations’ (Lehne\nand Preston 2018: 40). Of course, if these companies are to lead, there must also be institutional arrangements\nsupporting their engagement with other actors in the supply chain, government agencies, standard-setting\norganisations and civil society organisations.\nSecond, public procurement can provide extensive support for the manufacture and use of LCCs. All governments\nin developed countries have large procurement programs. These include large construction programs that provide\nboth economic and social infrastructure, which provides opportunities to support low-carbon innovation—including\nthe use of LCCs (Baron 2016). In Europe, the role of procurement in supporting a broad sustainability agenda has\nbeen formalised through the adoption of a Green Public Procurement policy (European Commission 2016).\nIn Australia, using procurement to reduce embodied carbon in building materials—including cement and concrete—\nis only beginning to be considered as part of recent sustainability commitments. However, there are some within\nthe industry that are making the case for using procurement to assist the cement and concrete industry develop\nits capacity to deliver LCCs.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 49", "text_len": 3984, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 56, "text": "4. Material supply chains\nand actors\nTransparency and product disclosure\nEnvironmental product declarations (EPDs) developed in the late 1990s. They have become the standardised\nway to present information on the environmental performance of construction products and services. An EPD is\neffectively a product certification system. Performance is assessed by using LCA, which requires that ‘all the main\ninputs to the processes that provide the service are taken into account, as well as the processes and materials\nthat feed into those processes, and so on back “up” the supply chains of the various materials in the product to\nthe raw resource inputs’ (Horne 2009).\nThe EPDs are based on the international standard ISO14025. In the case of building and construction products\nthey also align with the European standard EN15804 (Passer, Lasvaux et al. 2015). EPDs potentially aid generating\ndata that supports building-level assessments. However, further development of reporting requirements and\nimproved data consistency is required for whole-life carbon footprint assessments and the setting of thresholds\nand targets (BPIE 2021). The use of EPDs in the Australian building and construction industry is voluntary.\nThe first concrete EPD was registered in 2014 by a New Zealand company: Allied Concrete. The next step was the\n2017 publication of data that could be used in LCA calculations for Australian concretes. This was the product of\na collaborative process, where the main industry players pooled data while maintaining commercial in-confidence\nconcrete recipes. Then in 2019 Holcim began publishing EPDs. The reason they did it was because their ‘international\nparent decreed that everywhere in the world Holcim was going to have EPDs … Zurich told them that they had\nto do it’ (Participant C2). After this, the other major companies produced EPDs, and more recently some smaller\ncompanies have followed. ‘It is like a game of dominos.’ Also, for major projects, having an EPD ‘is now a requirement\nof supply’ (Participant C2).\nThe steps beyond the production of EPDs in Australia are uncertain, as there are no moves to include embodied\ncarbon provisions in NCC revisions. However, the NSW Building Commissioner is signalling interest in whole-life\ncarbon footprint assessments: ‘I believe we are looking at the opportunity of, within a year, having the technology\nto accept, for every single building, an actual carbon certificate for every piece [of material] that goes towards a\nbuilding’ (Frew 2021). The technology referred to is the development of an industry capacity to establish a system\nthat holds a digital as-built record of buildings where embodied carbon could be included (Perera, Jin et al. 2021)\nCarbon capture and storage\nGlobally and in Australia, the cement and concrete industry are relying on carbon capture and storage (CCS) in\ntheir commitments to decarbonise. As a process, CCS captures the CO gas, then compresses and transports it\n2\nto a site where it can be pumped and stored underground for geological time periods. The CCAA (2021: 10) states\nthat efficiency measures will not ‘reduce CO emissions from the calcination of the limestone. Breakthrough\n2\ntechnologies must therefore be implemented in which carbon capture will play an important role.’\nThis has led to CCS pilot projects being established and goals being set. The CCAA (2021) foreshadows pilot projects,\nbut to date no CCS pilot projects have been established in Australia by the cement industry. Although the industry\ncontinues to advocate for CCS and commits to confirming the use of CCS in their roadmaps, both the technologies\n(Voldsund, Gardarsdottir et al. 2019) and costs (Gardarsdottir, De Lena et al. 2019) continue to be assessed.\nUncertainties have led some people to propose radically changing the accepted concrete chemistry model as\na way of reducing CO emissions. One method is to significantly reduce the proportion of manufactured clinker\n2\ncement and replace 50 per cent of it with calcined clay—which is clay that has been heated to a high temperature\n—and ground limestone to make limestone calcined clay cement or ‘LC3’ (Habert, Miller et al. 2020). Another method\nis to cease using cement made from manufactured clinker altogether. Instead, the concrete aggregate is made\nfrom sand, gravel, clay, silts and organic plasticisers (Ouellet-Plamondon and Habert 2016).\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 50", "text_len": 4459, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 57, "text": "4. Material supply chains\nand actors\nCosts of abatement\nDecarbonising the cement and concrete industry will require new investment in plant and equipment, and will\nincrease recurrent costs. Three main measures have been identified by the industry (CCAA 2021: 31). They are:\n• further substitution of clinker in cement by supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) through increased\nuse of fly ash, ground granulated blast-furnace slag and clays\n• replacing the use of coal and gas fuels with biomass fuels and green hydrogen\n• using CCS.\nThe pathway for the first main measure (substituting clinker) is clearer than the second or third measures. Estimates\nof investment and operational costs depend very much on plant-specific analyses, which have not been done in\nAustralia. The only estimates available are indicative figures developed in Europe (ECRA and CSI 2017).\nHow these increased costs will be met is yet to be determined, but it is likely to be through a combination of\nindustry and government investment. Investment by the federal government was first signalled by DISER (2020),\nwhich recognised cement as a carbon-intensive product. Following the 2022 change of government, all that is\navailable at the time of writing is the ALP policy platform, which committed to a National Reconstruction Fund that\nwould assist with the decarbonisation of existing industries (Australian Labor Party 2021).\nA cost that the industry may well have to bear is meeting a price on carbon triggered by the ‘revised baselines’\n(Australian Labor Party 2021) referred to in subsection 4.2.1. A price should encourage the industry to continue\nreducing carbon emissions. Participant C2 sums up the effect: ‘a carbon price will generate a revenue stream that\ncan be invested in measures that reduce emissions and the price’.\nAn important factor in calculating and pricing carbon emissions will be how to recognise the emissions associated\nwith imported clinker. If decarbonisation measures required in Australia do not apply in the countries that are exporting\nclinker, then there will be a case for border-adjustment measures—similar to those being developed by the EU and\nother countries that are ramping up their climate mitigation commitments (Muller, Saddler et al. 2021). It is likely\nthat clinker manufactured in Australia and attracting a charge for emissions will be more expensive than clinker\nimported from countries that do not put a price on CO emissions. The CCAA (2021: 45) warns that ‘federal and\n2\nstate government policies and programs will be required in order to maintain the international competitiveness\nof the industry’. Maybe border-adjustment measures for clinker imported into Australia is such a policy.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 51", "text_len": 2789, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 59, "text": "4. Material supply chains\nand actors\n4.3 Steel\nSteel is used in both the HCI and MUATCI residential housing sectors. The manufacture of this steel starts with\ncompanies in the Iron Smelting and Steel Manufacturing Industry (ISSTM), as shown in Tier 3 of Figure 15. Four\ndownstream industries manufacture products, which then make their way into residential housing construction\nthrough industries providing onsite supply and construct services. Large amounts of embodied carbon in steel\nstocks are already in the housing system, and additions are important for decarbonisation and the development\nof a CE. The carbon intensity of steel is now well recognised by the steel industry in Australia and globally.\nIn the HCI market, there are two main types of construction, and both use steel:\n• The first and most dominant type is timber-framed housing, where the stud wall frame and roof trusses are\ntimber. Steel is used in the reinforced concrete waffle slab cast on the ground, in some structural beams and\nposts, and in products such as sheet-metal flashings, garage doors, gratings, balustrades, railings and roofing.\n• The second type is steel-framed houses, where cold-formed steel replaces timber wall frames and roof\ntrusses. All other uses of steel are the same as in timber-framed houses.\nGrowth in steel-framed house construction began following the formation of the National Association of Steel-\nframed Housing (NASH) in 1982, and incorporation of steel framing provisions in the NCC (Paton-Cole and Gad\n2017). The share of houses built with cold-formed steel in 2017/18 was 14 per cent (ACI 2018: 9). However, much\nof the growth tends to be in northern Australia because steel framing is termite proof (Participant S3). There are\nrecent indications of growth in the use of steel framing because of timber shortages.\nThe MUATCI dwellings are the greatest user of steel, as apartment buildings are usually constructed using\nreinforced concrete. Together the EE from steel and concrete result in buildings with a high EE coefficient (Li,\nFoliente et al. 2021 ), which increases the carbon intensity of Australian housing. Further, the uptake of two other\nless carbon-intensive construction types is languishing:\n• Lower-carbon mid-rise could be built using cold-formed steel to construct lightweight apartment buildings.\nHowever, there has been no uptake of this system in Australia—in contrast with the UK, the US and Canada\n(Franklin 2019).\n• Structural timber can be used to construct low-carbon mid-rise apartment buildings (Jayalath, Navaratnam\net al. 2020). Yet uptake of structural timber for mid-rise apartment buildings in Australia has been minimal.\nAustralian participation in the carbon-intensive steel industry is considerable. Australia is the world’s largest\nproducer of iron ore, representing 39 per cent of global production—of which 95 per cent was exported. In 2021,\nAustralia ranked 29th out of 50 steel-producing countries, with 5.8 million tonnes of crude steel production and\n0.3 per cent of world steel production (WSA 2022). Australia is therefore a major player in the global steel industry,\nand is in a unique position to contribute strongly to an emerging global green steel industry (Venkataraman,\nCsereklyei et al. 2022). The contemporary challenge is how to transition from a fossil-fuel-based blast-furnace\ntechnology to ‘green steel’ technology.\n4.3.1 Carbon in steel\nSteel production produces between 7 per cent and 9 per cent of GHG emissions (WSA 2021). Tier 5 iron-ore mining\nand coalmining businesses (see Figure 15) contribute a large share of Australian steel industry CO emissions. Steel\n2\nis produced by reducing iron ore to iron (‘ironmaking’), removing carbon, secondary refining and alloying (‘steelmaking’)\nand continuous casting. Three fossil-fuel-based production processes are available to the steel industry: blast\nfurnace, direct-reduced iron, and smelting reduction (Venkataraman, Csereklyei et al. 2022). These arrangements\nare no longer sustainable. Meanwhile, global demand for steel continues to increase.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 53", "text_len": 4141, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Material supply chains\nand actors\nCompanies using fossil-fuel-based production processes have lowered their emissions through technological\nimprovement, particularly the smelting reduction technique. There has also been less reliance on emissions-\nintensive primary iron-ore production, with a move towards cleaner secondary production using scrap steel\n(Winning, Calzadilla et al. 2017). However, further substantial emission reduction is required. The IEA (2020: 53)\nstates that the industry, if it is to be ‘compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement, its direct CO emissions\n2\nmust fall by more than 50 per cent by 2050 relative to today’. The steel industry’s response has been two-fold.\nFirst, the global industry association, the World Steel Association (WSA 2021), has committed the industry to\nreducing CO emissions by ‘transforming steel production’. Signalled headline measures are:\n2\n• efficiencies in production\n• maximising the use of scrap metal\n• developing and deploying breakthrough low-carbon technologies\n• material efficiency in the use of steel\n• advanced steel products.\nSecond, reducing emissions requires a governance framework for measuring and assessing decarbonisation.\nTwo initiatives have contributed to the framework:\n• The Responsible Steel (2021b: 65) standard sets up requirements for GHG measuring, reporting and target\nsetting at the site level.\n• The Net-Zero Steel Pathway Methodology Project (TWG 2021) is a broader framework that extends to supply-\nchain arrangements based on LCA and includes setting system boundaries and apportioning emissions from\nco-produced products.\nThe two major Australian steel manufacturers, BlueScope and InfraBuild, have made commitments to reduce\ntheir GHG emissions. Between 2005 and 2021, BlueScope Steel reduced their GHG-steelmaking emissions by\n40 per cent. Further, BlueScope has committed to another 12 per cent reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050\nfor its flat steel production (BlueScope 2021a). InfraBuild has committed to a new range of more materially\nefficient high-strength reinforcing steels, resulting in a 33 per cent reduction in mass compared with standard\nfitments (InfraBuild 2020).\nUse of scrap steel in new steel production reduces emissions, and all steel production uses scrap. While some\nprojections anticipate that recycled steel could fulfil future demand in steel there are two issues.\nFirst, the availability of scrap steel is a constraint (WSA 2021).\nSecond, contaminants limit the use of recycled steel for certain products, such as reinforcing bars in the construction\nindustry (Daehn, Cabrera Serrenho et al. 2017; Venkataraman, Csereklyei et al. 2022). Despite these limitations,\nscrap recycling will be critical for carbon reduction in the future. Winning, Calzadilla et al. (2017: 405) argue that\nsteel has CE potential because of its ‘potential double environmental benefits of increased secondary steel\nproduction which also uses low-carbon electricity as a significant input’. Participant S3 confirms the importance\nof scrap for reaching the BlueScope target: ‘how are we going to hit that 12 per cent? It’s increased renewables\n[renewable energy] and scrap has a big impact.’\nWhile progress is being made, the full scope of measures needed for decarbonisation requires change in the\nway that companies produce steel, along with broader system, industry and societal change. A review of the\nBlueScope (2021b) strategy suggests a series of measures for change (see Table 11). However, it is important\nto note that BlueScope is silent on the possibilities of a price on carbon or regulation.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 54", "text_len": 3682, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

BlueScope\nSteel has a 41.1 per cent market share. It manufactures 3 million tonnes of flat steel per year into products such\nas Colorbond and Zincalume for cladding and Truecore for steel framing in integrated steel plant in Port Kembla,\nNSW, using blast-furnace technology (BlueScope Steel Limited 2021). Liberty InfraBuild has a 6 per cent share of\nthe market, and manufactures steel long products, including reinforcing bar, reinforcing mesh, tubular and hollow\nsections, merchant bar and wire. Liberty operates an integrated steel plant in Whyalla, SA. It also recycles scrap\nsteel at two sites in Australia. The scrap-steel operation feeds 1.4 million tonnes of steel per year into InfraBuild\nsteelmaking (InfraBuild 2021). The rest of the ISSTM industry is comprised of many small to medium enterprises\n(Baikie 2021b).\nThe structure of the ISSTM (Figure 15) can be understood by focussing on three dimensions: concentration,\nvertical integration and capital intensity.\nConcentration\nIndustry concentration in the ISSTM industry is moderate, based on the 47.1 per cent market share of industry\nrevenue flowing to the two main manufacturers. The industry is also highly globalised. InfraBuild was taken over\nby the British GFG Alliance in 2017. BlueScope, an Australian-owned company, distributes products into North\nAmerica, ASEAN countries, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, China and India. Baikie (2021b: 39) notes that ‘over\n80 per cent of the industry’s enterprises employ fewer than 20 people and only 20.0 per cent of businesses\ngenerate over $2.0 million in revenue, annually’.\nVertical integration\nIndustry concentration is associated with a degree of vertical integration. InfraBuild achieves this through its upstream\niron-ore mining operations and downstream steel-tube manufacturing capacity. The BlueScope strategy has been\nto develop strong brand identities for its products. Additionally, BlueScope has internationalised the market for\nthese products to the countries noted above, and developed strong downstream market relationships. In the US,\nthis has occurred through the development of strategic alliances with related sector enterprises (Fairgray, Tamásy\net al. 2012). In Australia, the market relationships are with manufacturers in the Tier 2 and Tier 1 manufacturing\nindustries. BlueScope has a strong presence in one of these industries: the manufacturing of metal roof and\nguttering (Martin 2022). This is the context for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC\n2019) successfully taking action against BlueScope for alleged cartel behaviour, on the grounds that BlueScope\nsought to induce Australian steel distributors and overseas manufacturers to enter agreements containing a\nprice-fixing provision.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 55", "text_len": 3847, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This has led to a small well-established industry. However as\nthe industry association NASH states, ‘steel framing is not an easy industry in which to flourish … Steel framing\nlooks easy, but it is a major mistake to underestimate the difficulties inherent in the industry’ (Watson 2005). One\nissue is undercapitalisation, where steel availability often becomes an issue, as indicated by this stakeholder:\nThere are similar builders who have bought roll formers before allocation, but only just getting their\nfoot in the door and starting to do some of the light-gauge steel, who are on allocation and only get\none or two tonnes a month and could use 20 or 30 [tonnes]. (Participant S4)\nCapital intensity\nCapital intensity (CI) varies considerably across the supply chain industry (see Figure 15). The ISSTM industry\nhas medium-level CI. However, the level has been increasing and continues as the industry has restructured\nand reinvested in furnaces and casting equipment. Recently, BlueScope stated that it is likely to invest a billion\ndollars relining a mothballed blast furnace, which will contribute to further decarbonisation of its steelmaking\n(Roberts 2022). One downstream industry, metal roof and guttering manufacturing, also has a medium CI and has\nbeen increasing as companies have continued to automate their production by increasing their capital intensity.\nBlueScope is the company in this industry with the largest market share, at 37.6 per cent. One other downstream\nindustry in Tier 1, ‘Structural steel fabrication’ has a medium CI. BlueScope and Liberty have a combined 43.2 per\ncent market share in this industry, where they focus on higher-volume simple products suitable for automated\nproduction and fewer labour inputs (Kelly 2022d: 34).\n4.3.3 Steel industry innovation\nGlobally, the steel industry recognises that innovation is central for the decarbonisation of steel production\n(Responsible Steel 2021a; WSA 2021). In Australia, the two largest steel industry companies reflect the global\nindustry analysis and commitments by making significant civil society contributions. Four main directions for\ninnovation come through from the global and Australian contributions to the debate on how best to decarbonise\nthe steel industry. They are discussed in the following paragraphs.\nRecycling and reuse\nSteel manufacturing is environmentally intensive, yet it also allows for almost infinite recycling—and thus offers\na perspective to innovate (Winning, Calzadilla et al. 2017). ‘Every tonne of scrap used for steel production avoids\nthe emission of 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide, and the consumption of 1.4 tonnes of iron ore’ (WSA 2021: 4). If scrap\nrecycling is carried out in an electric furnace, then the energy intensity of production is 12.5 per cent (an eighth) of\nwhat it would be from iron-ore smelting (IEA 2020: 16).\nHowever, there are limitations to increasing the use of scrap steel. First, the availability of scrap steel is limited\nby the end-of-life rate of steel products. Globally, this rate correlates with the age of the steel structures and\nproducts in the capital stock of countries, which varies considerably. It is also shaped by other factors, in\nparticular the willingness of owners to avoid recycling of existing steel structures and products by smelting\nand instead renew products and retrofit buildings.\nSecond, the effectiveness of the collection and sorting of steel for scrap is an issue. This is partly a price issue.\nAs the IEA (2020: 30) notes, the availability of scrap increases along with price, but also depends on the cost of\nsorting scrap. Although there is the possibility of infinite recycling, there is also an issue about contaminants in\nscrap steel—especially copper (Daehn, Cabrera Serrenho et al. 2017).\nThe issue of recycling and reuse in the housing sector is connected to the broader issue of CDW. In this context, steel\nis just one material among many that are transported from a building or demolition site. Much of this transportation\nwill be done using skips, where sorting is not required. The contents of these skips will likely end up in landfill unless\nthe landfill charge or the price for recycled materials is high enough to create a market for separated materials and\ntheir recycling or reuse (Shooshtarian, Maqsood et al. 2020).\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 56", "text_len": 4583, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 63, "text": "4. Material supply chains\nand actors\nRecycling of scrap metal has only recently been receiving policy attention. Further, the policy attention and system\ndevelopment varies considerably across Australian state and territory jurisdictions, resulting in a complex field. A\nrecent review reveals that there are at least eight areas of strategy development in scrap metal reuse:\n• waste recycling\n• illegal dumping and stockpiling\n• extended producer responsibility\n• definition of waste versus resource\n• use of construction and demolition recycled waste\n• energy from waste extraction\n• education and engagement\n• market development (Shoostarian, Maqsood et al. 2020).\nOnsite, it is up to the builders to decide how they deal with their waste. One manufacturer supplying light metal\nframes for houses described his approach: ‘Most of our waste, we use it as packing to go to site, so we don’t have\na lot of waste. We probably get rid of two or three tonnes a month’ (Participant S4). The broader arrangement for\n‘getting rid’ of small offcuts was described:\nOver the next five to 10 years, it will probably get better, and it needs to. From our perspective,\nall our stuff goes into a couple of bins from our punchings and small offcuts, it all goes back to\nrecycling to the factory and [will] come back to us at some point. (Participant S4)\nThere is also the prospect of using ‘evolving technology’, which will further reduce waste by printing ‘the top plates\nfor location of trusses with truss numbers and everything on it, so that’s pre-done, pre-controlled’ (Participant S4).\nGreen steel technologies\nThere is broad agreement that current blast-furnace technology innovation has reached its limit, and that\nfull decarbonisation of steel only be accomplished by using what the World Steel Association (WSA 2021)\ncalls ‘breakthrough technologies’. The main elements being considered to contribute to early and later stage\ndecarbonisation are:\n• green hydrogen replacing coke as a reductant, generating HO instead of CO\n2 2\n• bio-resources to provide carbon to replace coke\n• CCS with utilisation of the CO\n2\n• electrolysis using renewable electrical energy.\nSimilar to changes in concrete manufacturing, breakthrough technologies in steel manufacture ‘will require major\nchanges in manufacturing processes, use of alternative materials that do not emit CO during manufacture, or\n2\nCCS technologies to minimise the release of process-related CO to the atmosphere’ (Davis, Lewis et al. 2018: 4).\n2\nAlthough there is broad agreement about the elements required, debate continues about the change process and\nits timing. This is partly because the geography of existing steelmaking is linked to supply-chain arrangements and\naccess to resources. According to Venkataraman, Csereklyei at al. (2022: 7), the two most prospective zero-carbon\nsteelmaking technologies are hydrogen-based direct-reduced iron (DRI)—otherwise known as hydrogen-based\nsteelmaking—and electrowinning, which involves extracting metals electrolytically from ore, ‘both of which would\nultimately require massive electricity infrastructure to supply the required primary energy input’.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 57", "text_len": 3221, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 64, "text": "4. Material supply chains\nand actors\nFor this reason, Australia has a competitive advantage, as the cost of energy will be ‘critical to the competitiveness\nof green steel production’ (Venkataraman, Csereklyei et al. 2022: 7) and the Pilbara region where most Australian\niron-ore mining is concentrated benefits from extremely favourable solar irradiation. This, added to onshore wind\nresources, creates ideal conditions for reliable large-scale electrification—while at the same time lowering the costs\nof green steel production. However, scientists note that while most of ‘these processes offer lower-carbon pathways\nfor steelmaking’, they ‘cannot completely eliminate the associated emissions’ (Venkataraman, Csereklyei et al. 2021: 3).\nThe challenge accompanying this program is the scale of investment required for the transformation.\nFirst, there is the investment in the steel sector. One projection is that an investment of $30 billion per year is\nrequired for the next 30 years, just to meet growing steel demand and maintain existing sites. Further investment\nof $6 billion per year is then required to transition the steel asset base to net zero. Calculated in terms of avoided\nemissions, this is a cost of $6 per tonne of CO avoided.\n2\nSecond, steel plants will require electricity to generate green hydrogen and electricity for their electrified assets.\nThis will require an 11–13 times increase of current electricity use (Net-Zero Steel Initiative 2021: 8).\nIndustry collaboration\nA transition to low-carbon steel production requires an industry transition involving levels of collaboration between\nfirms and with governments, research institutions, industry associations and unions. Examples of current collaborations\nin the steel industry aimed at lower-carbon emissions are the:\n• Australian Industry Energy Transitions Initiative (Climate Works Australia 2020)\n• Global CO Breakthrough Program.\n2\nSuch initiatives run alongside continuing competition between firms producing similar products and seeking to\nmaintain or increase their market advantage. In this context, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission\n(ACCC) is keen to ensure that collaboration does not undermine competition.\nCollaboration can also be global. An example is the work of Responsible Steel (2021b), a global multi-stakeholder\nstandard and certification organisation, that defines agendas and procedures for projects such as the Responsible\nSteel Standard. Structured around 12 principles, it sets out requirements and criteria that are auditable at the\ncompany and site level. At the local level, these processes are regularly organised by industry associations. In\nthe case of Australian Steel Institute, there is continuing work on an industry approach to decarbonisation. The\nbasis of collaboration in the industry aimed at defining and setting common parameters for decarbonisation was\noutlined by Participant S3:\nThere is a lot more collaborating on [the question]: ‘What does good look like for the steel industry\nrather than decarbonisation specifically [for one company]?’ … At the moment, we are trying to\nset what the thresholds look like for a piece of steel to be called responsible. How many tonnes of\nCO per tonne of steel is good? … Our focus is more on value, trade value-chain collaboration than\n2\ncompetitor collaboration. (Participant S3)\nSkills and practices: growth in light-gauge steel prefabrication\nEntry into light-gauge steel house construction has few barriers to entry and tends to attract people with some\nbuilding experience who are seeking to be self-employed small business owners. Initially, it involves procuring\na roll former, a licence to use software programs to design and manufacture steel trusses and frames, and some\nexperience as a builder. Computer-aided design (CAD), which was described by Participant S4 as a ‘video game\nfor chippies onsite’, requires varying levels of knowledge and expertise, and requires the assistance of an engineer\nfor the design of wall frames. One limitation slowing the use of steel prefabrication is regulation, with participants\nidentifying more regulations around wall frames than trusses:\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 58", "text_len": 4238, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 65, "text": "4. Material supply chains\nand actors\nThe trusses are self-certifying, so you can put a truss there and it’ll draw it in long as you’ve got a\ncouple of loadbearing points, it’ll tell you whether it will work or not. You can change it, manipulate\nit as you see fit to try and get it to pass with the loads, and so on. Wall frames are a little bit different.\nWe’ve got a design manual to work to. You need to sign off on it. The companies that buy those can\nsend it off to get checked and certified and then come back, or they can employ an engineer to\nunderstand and do it. (Participant S4)\nThere are also opportunities for prefabrication and efficiency gains through transport and weight reduction. In this\npathway, steel presents a competitive advantage in terms of weight compared to timber:\nNinety-nine per cent of the stuff that we do is prefabricated. And that’s where the steel frames\nare probably better at. For the houses that we build for our two main builders, that are probably\nbetween 300- and 400-square-metre homes, we fill two semis with frames and trusses. Most\ntimber-frame builders do probably 50-50 with their builds; their trusses are a little bit thinner than\nours because we do back-to-back so we are twice as thick with the truss profile. So rather than\nbeing 35 mm, 45 mm, we are 80 mm. Their frames are similar, but our frames are probably about\nhalf the weight of timber ones. (Participant S4)\nBeyond such accounts, there remains insufficient capabilities, training or experience in the assembly and manipulation\nof light steel on construction sites, where carpenters tend to rely on the extended experience with timber installation\ngained during their apprenticeship. The lack of training—and therefore ability to understand plans and instructions\n—becomes an issue when carpenters shift to light steel. Also, design and assembly differs between light-gauge\nsteel and timber regarding the average level of qualification required.\n4.3.4 Steel industry institutional challenges\nThe Technical Working Group (TWG 2021) describes the steel sector as ‘hard to abate’ for several reasons:\n• Steel production relies on fossil fuels, long-life capital-intensive assets and a long investment cycle—between\n25 and 40 years.\n• Steel is a global commodity with high competition, low selling prices and low profitability—which reduces\ninvestment potential (TWG 2021).\n• Despite technological innovation and new investment, continuing high rates of urbanisation mean there\nwill be continued demand for virgin steel.\n• Less carbon-intensive technologies are not yet developed sufficiently for large-scale asset renewal\n(Venkataraman, Csereklyei et al. 2022).\nThe steel industry is a carbon-intensive industry, so the extent and nature of the discussion with the finance\nand insurance sector also matters in terms of how it plans to:\n• mitigate climate change risks\n• finance the reconfiguration of steel production.\nThe industry modes of production also present some challenges in understanding the material flows that go into\nsteel production. There are some issues from a data perspective (see Section 2), which mean it is more difficult to\ndesign for deconstruction:\nAt the producer level, there is the ability to see aggregate production, but then quickly there are\nchannels where other players get involved in transforming it, and then distributing or installing it.\nIf the producers don’t need to know the distinction, they have not invested time to interrogate it.\n(Participant S2)\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 59", "text_len": 3569, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Material supply chains\nand actors\nFinally, the Australian steel industry is acutely aware of the competition from alternative materials and substitutes\nand their related industries for a transition to low-carbon housing in Australia. In particular, residential steel products\nare competitively positioned against sawn timber and engineered wood products (EWPs) and timber framing in\nthe residential sector.\nWhile there is growth in the volume of steel products, it is difficult to estimate the supply of steel products for residential\nconstruction. Participant S3 estimates that in 2018–2019, about 12–13 per cent of steel production was going into\nthe residential housing industry, and there was an increase of about 2 or 3 per cent in the five years prior to that.\nThus the steel industry is slowly positioning itself to venture into the mid-rise residential space, a sector that\ncontinues to increase in Australian residential housing construction despite the competition from concrete\nand the need for additional training or adaptation of steel-installation techniques:\n[A steel roofing product] is probably not something that we would probably work towards for mid-rise,\ntypically because it’s generally concrete anyway, and probably not fit for purpose in that space. So\nit’s not something that we have entertained too much. There are aspects of cladding for mid-rise in\n[name of product] that we are looking into, a lot of our channel members being installers. They do\nhave a bit of that coming through.

Material supply chains\nand actors\n4.4 Timber\nTimber is a low-emission biomaterial that is used in both HCI and MUATCI residential housing. Timber\nmanufacturing starts with forestry primary production in Tier 4 businesses (see Figure 16). The product then\ngoes downstream to Tier 3 manufacturing industries, including log sawmilling and timber wholesaling. In Tier\n2 businesses, the timber resawing and dressing industry are engaged in importing timber, which represents\napproximately 20 per cent of annual timber supply (Woods and Houghton 2022). Businesses in Tier 1 industries\nmanufacture a wide range of products and provide services to the housing industry.\nThe wood product industry supplying the housing industry is structured around two supply chains:\n• Lightweight timber sawn from lumber—‘a lightweight chain that is very commodity-driven’ (Participant T9).\nLightweight timber is used for residential ‘stick building’, which uses small-dimension timber for trusses, wall\nframes and floors. The more air there is in the structure, the cheaper and less solid it is.\n• Engineered wood products (EWP)—including ‘mass timber’ in forms such as cross-laminated timber (CLT),\nglue-laminated timber (Glulam) and laminated veneer lumber (LVL). EWPs are manufactured, and are more\nexpensive than lightweight timber and ‘a totally bespoke value chain’ (Participant T9). These products are made\nfrom the same hardwoods and softwoods as sawn timber, but mixed with adhesives that bind the strands,\nparticles, fibres, veneers or boards. This product often incorporates treated sawmill waste to produce wood\nthat meets precise size requirements.\nStarting with the low-emission biomaterial property of timber, some groups in the timber and housing industry\nargue that timber used in residential housing construction can make a significant contribution to decarbonising\nthe housing industry. This argument underpins a long-running project advocating for greater use of timber. The\nfirst step was to successfully advocate for reform of the NCC to support the inclusion of deemed-to-satisfy\nprovisions for building timber structures up to 25 metres in height, or eight to nine storeys. A second step was\nestablishing the Wood Solutions Mid-rise Advisory Program, which supported design professionals and the\nhousing industry to expand timber use in residential housing construction (Lavisci 2020; Wood Solutions 2023).\nPerinotto (2022) suggests that ‘there’s an information war going on between advocates for timber, concrete and\nsteel, and everyone is claiming their material is the best from an environmental perspective’.\n4.4.1 Carbon in timber\nThe focus on embodied carbon in buildings has led to research advocating for greater use of timber rather than\nconcrete or steel (see Campbell 2019; Carvalho, Jorge et al. 2020; Churkina, Organschi et al. 2020; Gu, Liang et\nal. 2020; Hafner and Schäfer 2017; Jayalath, Navaratnam et al. 2020; Lu, Hanandehet al. 2017; Perry, Pechey et\nal. 2021; Robati and Oldfield 2022; Thomas and Ding 2018).\nFor example, Robati and Oldfield (2022) compare timber and concrete buildings and find that mass timber buildings\ngenerally have lower-embodied carbon than concrete buildings. Similarly, Jayalath, Navaratnam et al. (2020: 1)\nstate that the ‘use of 17 per cent of timber in construction as an alternative to brick, aluminium, steel and concrete,\nan reduce GHG emissions by about 20 per cent’.\nSome actor groups are using this research to argue for timber being used more often as a structural material and,\nat least in part, replacing concrete and steel. They argue that by growing trees, which sequester atmospheric CO,\n2\nusing structural timber in building construction can act as carbon sinks (Churkina, Organschi et al. 2020). One of\nthe benefits of trees and timber harvesting, just like other biomaterials, is their capacity to ‘use photosynthesis to\nconvert atmospheric CO into oxygen and sugars, the latter of which is stored as carbon in the material biomass’\n2\n(Robati and Oldfield 2022: 2). Robati and Oldfield (2022: 2) argue that timber housing strategy in Australia could\n‘reduce built environment life cycle GHG emissions by 94 per cent at a national scale, compared to business as usual’.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 62", "text_len": 4308, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 69, "text": "4. Material supply chains\nand actors\nDespite this emerging research, there is as yet no developed and agreed strategy endorsed by timber industry actors\nin the extended supply change. Participant T9 suggests that the timber industry is ‘highly conflicted’. For example:\nWhen it comes to a carbon tax, if you’re a large processor, you have electricity bills. You only see\na carbon tax as a cost. Rather than seeing it inflicting costs on your competitors, they only see it\nthrough the lens of adding costs to their business. (Participant T9)\nThere is also no agreement about the accounting system used to measure and record carbon in timber in any\ncarbon accounting system. That lack of agreement is evident in the divide between the primary and secondary\nproducers in the supply chain:\nThe plantations get a credit, but the builder gets nothing. The government looks at this at a national\nlevel and … from an accounting point of view divides the economy into eight to 10 sectors [as] …\nthey don’t have the policy rules that are cross-sectoral. And they can’t do that through carbon price.\n(Participant T9)\nAt present the system is limited because ‘you can only achieve net zero through forestry, not by using wood\nproducts’. It only supports ‘planting more trees or avoiding emissions from other materials’ (Participant T9).\nSimilarly, if imported timber is used, the only benefit is in those avoided emissions from the other materials.\nThere is no equivalent protocol for system-wide carbon accounting in the timber industry as in the steel industry\n(Responsible Steel 2021b).\nThe response proposed by Robati and Olfield (2022: 14) is to ‘stop framing embodied carbon as a static upfront\ncarbon impact’. Instead, embodied carbon should be understood as ‘dynamic and temporal’, which requires\naccounting across the building life cycle, including end-of-life.\n4.4.2 Timber industry structure\nIndustries in the timber supply chain, with two exceptions, are characterised by low-level industry concentration.\nThe exceptions are two Tier 1 manufacturing industries—Fabricated wood and Prefabricated building—and\nTier 3 and Timber wholesaling with medium concentration. The most significant is Fabricated wood, where the\nthree largest companies have 60 per cent of the market share (Kelly 2022a). Similarly, capital intensity through\nthe supply chain is generally low. Only Forestry and logging, Timber wholesaling and Prefabricated building have\nmedium capital intensity.\nIn other words, there are no large dominant players as there are in the steel and concrete industries. It is a less\ncapital-intense industry dominated by SMEs. Participant T9 summed up the implications of this structure for the\ntimber industry in relation to R&D and innovation:\nNo one has R&D capacity, unlike the property-sector firms like Stockland, Mirvac and Lendlease.\nThey are not developers—they are machines. And because you’re a machine, you have to constantly\nbe ahead of the game. […] The big boys have a very different operating model than the small guys.\n(Participant T9)\nThis fragmented low and medium industry concentration is also reflected in the number and diversity of industry\nand professional associations.\nIndustry and professional associations\nThe timber industry has many industry associations formed by companies making particular wood products, such as\nthe Australian Glass and Windows Association, Frame and Truss Manufacturers Association, Engineered Wood\nProducts Association of Australasia, Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association, Australasian Timber Flooring\nAssociation, and Australian Timber Importers Federation. In Tier 4, the Forestry and logging industry, the associations\nare geographically aligned, such as the Victorian Forest Products Association and Timber Queensland. This pattern\nrelates to the history of forestry, where access to hardwood forest timber was governed by state government\nstatutory authorities:\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 63", "text_len": 3997, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Rather, broader industry leadership is provided by two organisations:\n• Australian Forest Products Association (AFPA) is the national industry body representing the resources,\nprocessing, and pulp, paper and bioproduct industries covering the forest-products value chain. It starts with\nthe forestry end of the supply chain and focuses on the bulk commodity products. It does not extend to the\nTier 1 manufacturing industries.\n• Forest and Wood Products Australia (FWPA) is not an industry association, but is one of 15 rural research\nand development corporations (RDCs) supported by the Australian Government and by levies paid by wood\nprocessors, forest growers, and forest-products importers. FWPA research expenditure receives matching\ngovernment funds.\nThe outcome is summed up by one participant, who argued that the problem is that strategic thinking is ‘threadbare’\n(Participant T1). The relatively small industry associations focus on servicing their members and do not have the\nresources to develop broader industry strategy: ‘In the old days, they might have been strategic in a parochial\nsense, but these days there’s no strategic thinking’ (Participant T1).\nWood supply and plantations\nAustralia has few comparative advantages for forestry and plantations because it has relatively poor soils and a\nhistory of policy failures governing the use of hardwood forests and the development of plantations. Instead, there\nis a need for a strategic, long-term roadmap that increases tree-growing to compete with countries equipped\nwith better soils, more rainfall and climates that produce ‘those nice straight fur type trees, like spruce and Baltic\ntrees, that get used a lot in construction’ (Participant T1). At present, Australian tree production is more expensive,\nas Participant T1 explained:\nAt the very economic base of the Australian timber industry, there is the stumpage cost. The cost\nof the Australian log at the tree stump is higher. It’s great to have significant plantations, but in a\npure global perspective, if our economy is up, and their economy is really going, we’re building a\nlot. If other economies are down, timber tends to be a bit cheaper even with all transport costs.\n(Participant T1)\nGovernment interventions supporting tree-planting began in the 1870s in regions with little local supply (DAFF 2008).\nAfter that, state governments established the first softwood plantations. It was not until 1997 that Australia developed\nits first plantation policy and supported large-scale native eucalyptus plantations. Plantations for Australia: The\n2020 Vision, developed by federal, state and territory governments, supported expanding the plantation estate\nto 3 million hectares by 2020, and included a processing industry. However, for Participant T1 this policy design\nwas flawed:\nUnder the Howard government, there were primary-industry tax concessions. Unfortunately, it\nbrought about fairly one-sided businesses that were investment-based businesses that planted\ntrees, instead of establishing plantation-based businesses, like Timber Corps, FEA, the Great\nSouthern Plantations. They were using a tax benefit, but it didn’t really create enough productive\nplantation because they were getting an eight-year return from the blue gums—Eucalyptus globulus.\nYou can harvest that in eight years, but they were looking for fast turnaround. (Participant T1)\nSubsequent growth in plantations has slowed over recent decades.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 64", "text_len": 4174, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Material supply chains\nand actors\nThe forestry portfolio currently sits within the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (DAWE),\nan ambivalent position in government according to Participant T1:\nGrowing trees, obviously that’s primary production. But turning the trees into finished products\nis primary processing. And that’s quite sophisticated. […] So it’s a bit like, ‘Well, you take a tree,\nwe don’t see that as high-tech manufacturing.’ But in fact everything to do with turning a tree into\nfinished products is high-tech manufacturing. But, yes, we sit within agriculture. (Participant T1)\nSubsequent efforts to have forestry recognised for the development of Industry 4.0-driven manufacturing\nhas not been successful, and this has limited advanced manufacturing in the timber industry:\nThey’ve created these centres of excellence around manufacturing, and we’ve turned up to those\nstructures and said, ‘We’re forestry, we’d really like to do some stuff around big data and sawmilling.’\nAnd they go, ‘You’re not food manufacturing, so we’re not interested.’ (Participant T1)\nSupply chain lock-ins\nThe residential-housing-industry supply chain is structured in a way that enables some actors to control how\nwood is used. In effect, it disconnects timber producers from end users and prevents change and innovation\nalong the supply chain. As Participant T1 put it, ‘[the growers] are divorced from the market’. Two struggles over\nsupply-chain arrangements illustrate the way power can be exercised in supply-chain arrangements that preserve\nthe status quo. The first struggle relates to softwood; the second to nail plate.\nStructural softwood is produced in Australia by approximately six to eight companies, and there are eight to\n10 softwood importers of significance (Participant T9). These are all reasonably sized business turning over\nbetween $100 and $120 million. However:\nWith $100 and $120 million turnover in business, these are reasonably sized sophisticated\nbusinesses. One of the reasons that [an Australian timber manufacturer] was originally trying to go\ninto the prefabrication area was to have more degrees of freedom. They were threatened by their\ncustomers, who said that if they continued to do this, they wouldn’t buy as much timber. The supply\nchain [downstream] is locked in on you by one of the actor groups. (Participant T9)\nAnother value chain lock-in relates to the role played by nail-plate companies such as Pryda, Multinail and MiTek.\nSetting up a frame and truss company is a low capital business, requiring truss and wall panel machinery, software,\ntraining and finance. The arrangement set up between the nail plate company and the frame and truss company\ncan be financially ‘on good terms’. However, the arrangement also means that a frame and truss company cannot\nshift to another nail-plate company. Participant T9 explained that the manufacturer ‘effectively becomes trapped\nin that ecosystem’:\nFrame and truss companies are basically jobbing shops. Every frame and truss is effectively\ndifferent. You can only make them one at a time, or if you’ve got two lines, two at a time. There is no\nmanufacturing efficiency, no economies of scale. There’s no standard truss produced in Australia\n... In some ways it’s a form of sharecropping; they are a captured value chain. One of the few things\nthat these small companies can change about their business is their timber supply. Their role might\nhave 100 per cent loyalty to a nail-plate company, but they do not have any significant loyalty, or\nless loyalty, to a timber company, and will shop around. (Participant T9)\nOverall, relationships in the timber supply chain are structured around a set of interests that militate against\nindustry development and innovation in the use of timber in the HCI industry:\nIf you are a timber company, and to some extent through the wholesale chain as well, the timber\nindustry is basically trapped by its customers. Even though they are much bigger in size and\nsophistication, they are not controllers of their destiny.

Material supply chains\nand actors\n4.4.3 Timber industry innovation\nTwo areas of timber industry innovation show how industry supply chains are resistant to change. First is the\ndifficulty in getting timber to be used in mid-rise, multi-unit apartment housing structures. Mid-rise, multi-unit\nhousing in the MUACTI industry has traditionally been built by constructing buildings with reinforced concrete\ncolumns and floors. They can be built with timber, but this innovation has largely not been adopted. Second, there\nis considerable scope for reducing waste and increasing the flow of materials through the timber supply chain by\ngreater use of Industry 4.0 digital technologies.\nTimber and multi-unit apartments\nIn 2016, the use of timber to build MUACTI mid-rise residential apartment buildings was allowed following the\nincorporation of a ‘deemed-to-satisfy provision’ in the NCC, allowing for residential apartment buildings up to\n25 metres in height (8–9 storeys). Two existing timber buildings informed the development of the NCC deemed-\nto-satisfy provisions: Forte, built by Lendlease; and The Green, built by Fraser’s. The factor that enabled their\nacceptance was responding to fire risks ‘by encasing [timber] in fire-resistant plasterboard’ (Participant T9).\nTwo types of timber construction can be used to construct multi-unit apartments: stick building and EWPs. The\nstick-built technology extends the technology used in the residential house construction industry, which uses\ntimber-framed walls, timber floors and roof trusses. In multi-unit construction, the frames and floors are stacked\non top of each other. The EWPs are bespoke products that meet specified design requirements and structural\nstandards. However, the adoption of these two timber technologies in the MUACTI industry has largely stalled.\nIn the case of the stick-built industry, supporters have largely failed to generate interest from within the HCI to\nextend their operations into a new type of construction using well-established stick-built technology and skills:\nDespite all the effort … there’s still no frame and truss company in Australia that wants to supply\nthe non-detached market. And particularly to go through the market cycles that we’ve had,\neven though they would have had the capacity to do it anyway. So, effectively after six years and\nsince the introduction of the deem-to-satisfy provisions, we’ve failed to deliver lightweight multi-\nresidential construction. (Participant T9)\nThe take-up of EWPs in the MUACTI industry has also failed, despite it being used in university, corporate and state\ngovernment buildings, as well as in institutional residential buildings such as student accommodation. Developers\nin the MUACTI industry, with a few exceptions, have not switched from designing and building reinforced concrete-\nframed buildings to the unfamiliar EWP technology manufactured and prefabricated offsite factories.\nThe FWPA Wood Solutions training project and the production of Technical Design Guides has not convinced the\nMUACTI developers, their finance sources, design consultants and builders to initiate and procure timber multi-\nunit apartment buildings. In this context, there is scope for reviewing the way these actor groups identify and\nassess risks that could arise in a transition from reinforced concrete to timber as the main structural material\nin multi-unit apartment buildings.\nIndustry 4.0 digital technologies\nDigital technologies can support information-sharing and improve coordination along the supply chain, which is\ndominated by SMEs with no R&D capacity and limited access to capital. Digital technologies have the potential to\nincrease efficiency and reduce waste. This has led to a FWPA project that has made progress in introducing digital\ntechnologies to some parts of the industry. An example is the use of digital technology to scan logs going through\nsawmills: FWPA funded the research that enabled all the sawmills to benefit from upgrading their scanners. This\nupgrade, coupled with the right software, supported better analysis of log volumes and enabled optimal cutting\nof timber to different sizes and lengths. This type of innovation is in everyone’s interest because they are all paying\nfor the material.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 66", "text_len": 4333, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 73, "text": "4. Material supply chains\nand actors\nHowever, a problem still remains, as the downstream sawn timber users are not digitally connected to the sawmillers.\nThis means that downstream user data about the lengths they cut when making up wall frames and trusses is not\ntransmitted back to the sawmillers. The sawmillers have no data to make decisions about the lengths that could\nsignificantly reduce waste created by downstream users. Participant T1 describes the problem:\nBecause he’s busy buying a 6-metre length, he cuts it down to a 1.8 metre, and he ends up with\n30 per cent waste. Whereas if his cutting patterns were fed back to the sawmiller, the sawmiller\ncould go, ‘Great, I can punch bloody ten 1.8 metre lengths out of these logs, and get more\nproductivity.’ (Participant T1)\nBecause of this failure to digitally join up firms along the supply chain, the levels of waste increase. As Participant\nT1 says: ‘They can’t get enough material, and they’re wasting 10 or 15 per cent of it because the sizes don’t fit what\nthey have to cut.’\nDigital technologies can also support information-sharing along the supply chain, improve coordination and\nreduce waste. The idea of supply-chain integration could even be extended by pooling data so that it can be used\nup and down the supply chain by growers, sawmillers, distributors, wholesalers and manufacturers. Participant T1\nsums up the situation: ‘We need to grow more trees, but that’s going to take 20–30 years … but something we can\ndo in the short term is improve productivity.’\n4.4.4 Timber industry institutional challenges\nThere are two stand-out institutional challenges facing the Australian timber industry and supplying timber for\nfuture use in residential housing. They are:\n• the continuing reliance on imported timber, and a forecast increase in this reliance\n• the failure to systematically consider how the enormous stocks of timber already layered into the existing\nresidential housing stock will be reused as this stock is progressively renewed.\nReliance on imported timber\nAustralia relies on timber imports. The long-term annual average of timber imports has been 20 per cent of total\nsupply by volume, and the gap is forecast to reach 40 per cent by 2050 (Woods and Houghton 2022: 6). There are\ntwo reasons for this reliance on imports. First, the increased protection of native forests has resulted in a decline\nin hardwood timber. Second, plantation timber policy has led to growth, but it is insufficient. Jenkin (2018: 10) sums\nup the history of plantation timber production:\nFarm forestry has been a grand experiment promoting commercially un-proven species to be\nplanted and managed in a commercially un-proven manner in areas lacking a market for the target\nlog outcomes.\nIn this context, Participant T9 argues for ‘providing an incentive to increase the amount of commercial wood\nproduction in Australia through planting more trees … a properly planned plantation policy’. Participant T9 sees\nthe need for urgency because timber is competing with steel:\nWe’ve only got probably got 10 to 15 years left as a competitive advantage. As soon as you have\nrecycled steel that is being produced with renewable energy, the embodied energy of steel will\nprobably be as good or better than wood products. (Participant T9)\nThere is broad recognition for the need to reformulate plantation policy. The history, management, policy settings\nand prospects of plantations have been well researched (Jenkin 2018; Jenkin, Keenan et al. 2019; Standing\nCommittee on Agriculture and Water Resources 2021; Whittle, Lock et al. 2019) and provide the basis for\nstakeholder engagement and a process for reformulation.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 67", "text_len": 3743, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Material supply chains\nand actors\nWaste and reuse\nExisting buildings, particularly housing built over a very long period of time, contain very large quantities of\ntimber. As these buildings reach the end of life, they are typically demolished. The question in this era where the\nconservation of building materials is becoming a priority is: how should recycled timber be treated? Data from\nthe states and territories indicates that in 2016–17 nearly 2.4 million tonnes (2,369,680 t) of timber waste was\ngenerated. It is estimated that the construction and demolition sector was responsible for 26 per cent, and the\ncommerce and industry sector 64 per cent (Shooshtarian, Maqsood et al. 2019: 24).\nCurrently there is no regulation of used timber. It is simply assumed to be waste and it is one form of waste among\nmany that is covered by the same legislation as general waste. Nor is there a commonly accepted practice that\nleads to the systematic conservation and reuse of timber. Nevertheless, there is a market for recycled timber.\nHowever, it is a small market that tends to focus on highly valued larger pieces of timber that are retrieved and\nreused for furniture and featured in new constructions. A common practice is demolition and disposal of the\ntimber as waste. Participant T1 graphically describes what usually happens:\nThat’s the reuse challenge, because any reuse that sort of appeals to people looking at circular\neconomy is really boutique […] But that would be 1 per cent of what happens, because these\nhouses that are getting demolished, I looked at some data the other day, that 16,000 houses\nwere knocked over last year in Australia, most of them would just be bowled over, put in the back\nof a truck and probably 90 per cent of it ends up in landfill because no one bothers to even try and\nstrip the timber out of it. (Participant T1)\nFor most actors in the demolition and the housing industry, recycled timber is regarded as ‘waste’ as opposed\nto ‘resource’, as it is perceived as having little to no value:\nIt’s like everything in our industry. Everyone’s a tightwad so they don’t pay for that, they say, ‘Oh,\nwe’re doing you a favour by getting rid of your waste,’ so they aren’t paying the frame and truss guy\nfor his waste, which is sort of crazy because it’s obviously got value. This is always the great dispute\nin our industry: who makes the money? Where does the value sit? And everyone always figures it’s\nthe other bloke who’s getting the money rather than them. (Participant T1)\nAnother challenge with reuse is the potential toxicity of treated timber products. As Participant T1 put it: ‘How do\nwe deal with treated products within that mix? Because you can’t put treated products through the same process,\nbecause the chemicals can be toxic’ (Participant T1).\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 68", "text_len": 2868, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Material supply chains\nand actors\n4.5 Policy development implications for building materials supply chains\nThis section has presented case-study analyses of the institutional arrangements that produce concrete, steel\nand timber building materials that flow into and out of the residential housing system. Builders in both building\nconstruction industries orchestrate these material flows onto building sites and into dwellings. However, they\ndo this within a context where many other actor groups—such as built-environment professionals, finance\ninstitutions, regulators, developers, distributors, manufacturers and purchasers—all contribute to establishing\nthe ‘rules of the game’.\nUntil now, the carbon embodied in the materials flowing into and out of the housing system has not been a concern\nof any of these actor groups. This is the context for the development of a CE policy framework that can guide some\nactors to insist that recognising and reducing embodied carbon be incorporated into the ‘rules of the game’.\nThree areas of policy development are proposed that could assist in reforming the ‘rules of the game’ for the use\nand reuse of building materials in the residential housing sector:\n• learning about carbon in building materials\n• regulation\n• supply chains and industry policy.\n4.5.1 Learning about carbon in building materials\nThe idea that carbon can be embodied in building materials is a new concept for most people involved in the\nresidential housing system—employees, contractors and subcontractors, consultants, professionals and\nregulators. Education and training systems could potentially provide the means for increasing the knowledge\nand understanding of carbon in building materials by those working in the residential housing system. The higher\neducation, TAFE and professional development systems could all make a contribution. Initial steps that could be\ntaken in developing a policy and program development initiative are outlined below.\n• Find a suitable high-profile government agency or civil society organisation to prepare a discussion and\nconsultation paper on learning about carbon in building materials through higher education, TAFE and\nprofessional development.\n• Conduct a national consultation with industry intermediary organisations—such as industry associations,\nprofessional associations and civil society organisations—universities with built-environment programs,\nTAFE colleges with built-environment trade programs.\n• Present the report with recommendations for a national program to support learning about carbon in building\nmaterials to federal, state and territory governments, seeking their resourcing and support to include this form\nof learning into their climate change mitigation strategies.\n4.5.2 Regulating for low carbon\nThe NCC is a performance-based code that sets minimum levels for the safety, health, amenity, accessibility\nand sustainability of buildings. The Australian Building Control Board (ABCB) acts on behalf of the federal, state\nand territory governments to produce and revise the NCC. The ABCB could be required to expand the scope\nof its sustainability regulation to support the decarbonisation of the housing system by regulating to lower the\nembodied carbon in material flows into housing, along with the reuse of CDW materials from the housing system.\nThe extended regulatory regime should be supported by a simple-to-use digital recording system that records\nthe flow of materials into the housing system. This should be based on a system that reads bills of quantity and\nrequires manufacturers to generate EPDs for all materials. This system should be designed so that there is national\nmonitoring of the stocks and flows of materials in the housing system, while also supporting regulators at the local,\nregional and state or territory levels.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 70", "text_len": 3906, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Material supply chains\nand actors\n4.5.3 Supply chains and industry policy\nBuilding-material supply chains are complex. The involve different actors that are often uncoordinated and\nhave conflicting interests, including manufacturers, distributors, retailers, regulators, professional consultants,\ncontractors and subcontractors. Many of these actors, in addition to participating in complex supply chains,\nare also members of or are affiliated with an intermediary organisation such as an industry or professional\nassociation. For example, a sheet-metal product manufacturer might belong to the Metal Roofing and Cladding\nAssociation. Further, the CEO might be a member of Engineers Australia.\nThese multiple forms of affiliation, including firm, industry and profession, provide the basis for formalising\nconsultative arrangements for supply chains that could support collaborative supply-chain decarbonisation\nplanning and implementation. For example, it would be possible to identify the actors that are involved in the\nmanufacturing, specifying, delivery and installation of concrete to residential housing projects. On this basis\nthose involved in the relevant intermediary organisations such as the CCAA, Concrete Institute of Australia,\nSteel Reinforcement Institute of Australia, HIA, MBA, Engineers Australia, Australian Institute of Quantity\nSurveyors and AIB could be brought together. These temporary network organisations could be established\nas housing-industry supply-chain councils.\nThe industry supply-chain councils would be resourced by two federal ministerial agencies in the areas of climate\nchange mitigation and industry development. In line with suitable terms of reference, they would be supported to\nidentify the constraints and opportunities for CE, decarbonisation and industry development. The processes they\ncould use include research and consultation papers, proposals for industry/supply chain support programs, regulatory\nreform, research projects and areas for de-risking investment through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 71", "text_len": 2136, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Policy recommendations\nSection 5.1 summarises the key findings against the guiding project research questions. Section 5.2 connects the\nfindings with the strategy elaborated as part of the Inquiry overarching project.\n5.1 Summary of research findings\nWho are the key institutional actors in the supply chain supplying materials for use in the\nAustralian residential housing system?\nThe institutional perspective reveals how industry fragmentation continues to shape the flow of building materials in\nhousing construction. Builders in the housing industry draw materials for house and multi-unit apartment construction\nfrom many supply chains, and draw products and services from at least 27 industries. Some building materials\nsupply chains are dominated by oligopolistic building materials manufacturers, while others are more fragmented,\nwith a larger presence of SMEs. There are also innovators and risk takers seeking to change materials design,\nproduction, distribution, disposal and reuse. There are various opportunities and constraints for CE innovation\nboth within oligopolistic supply-chain arrangements and smaller innovative risk-taking companies. All key institutional\nactors in the supply chain will need to change if there is to be systematic and deep reduction, reuse, recycling and\nrecovery of resources.\nWhat supply-side/demand-side drivers can increase the contribution that materials\nproduction and distribution can make to a CE?\nThe research established that the CE concept is not an embedded or well-understood concept in the material\nsupply chain and housing industries. However, a number of drivers were identified that have the potential to\nhelp shift the framing and conduct of supply chain industries so that they could become more familiar with CE\nconcepts and practices. These drivers include:\n• financially incentivising improved design, including design for deconstruction\n• construction and end-of-life practices, including end-of-life stewardship responsibilities\n• ensuring that large-scale stockpiling of used materials is practical and affordable\n• ensuring that NCC regulations and local planning approvals are developed and implemented so that\nregulation supports CE.\nThe efficacy and continued development of drivers can be supported by the improved recording of the flow and\ncomposition of materials through the use of material passports into and out of the residential housing system.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 72", "text_len": 2499, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Policy recommendations\nWhat are the needs and opportunities for training and Australian jobs in the creation of\nthe materials supply chain within a developing CE?\nThe research finds that there is little understanding or interest in how to introduce and make CE changes, and\nthat there will be a need for significant (re)training of key industry stakeholders. An example was seen in The\nCape case study in Section 3.2, where stakeholder training on new measures was provided in how to prevent\nthermal bridging, and how to seal buildings. The two case studies highlighted the benefits of contractors and\nsubcontractors collaborating so that everyone improves. This approach is different to much of the industry,\nwhere businesses compete and protect their IP. Within the industry more broadly, there are few opportunities\nto learn about CE practices such as disassembly and materials reuse. For those who do have knowledge and\nexperience in CE, there will be opportunities to work in this area as demand for expertise grows.\nWhat are the key innovation challenges and opportunities from Industry 4.0 and the use\nof materials in the Australian residential housing system?\nMaterial stocks use by housing industry, dominated by heavyweight materials such as brick and concrete,\ncontinues to increase. Development of databases and the capacity to use the data will require significant\ninnovation. A starting point is to ensure that the data is captured through the required submission of ABDs and\ndigital passports. These measures provide a framework for tracking materials and product use over time and will\nextend the practices of deconstruction, reuse and recycling. They can also assist in understanding the cost of CE\npractices, and how they can be factored into the economics of new buildings and their maintenance. Also, these\nmeasures can assist in costing the constraints flowing from the lack of factory-based offsite manufacturing where\nCE systems and practices are more easily established.\nWhat are the challenges and opportunities—financial, fiscal, regulatory and policy—for\nmaterial use resulting in more sustainable design and build outcomes?\nThe challenge for the housing sector is to develop strategies to decarbonise the flow of materials into the housing\nstock, increase material reuse and reduce the use of new materials. CE principles are best put in place at the\ndesign phase, which can be difficult given the lack of expertise. The recovery and reuse of building materials is\nalso difficult in the absence of regulation, underpricing of landfill, the absence of markets, poor waste-stream\ndata collection, and designs that do not support material end-of-life recovery. There is some reuse of materials,\nprincipally concrete and steel, where there is stewardship and markets. However, timber reuse is limited to niche\nor boutique initiatives, or is downcycled into mulch or fencing. The costs of cleaning up timber by removing nails\nand its compliance with standards are issues that make reuse problematic. Similarly, kitchen and plumbing\nsupplies are rarely reused or recycled as high-quality recovery is compromised when deconstruction is not\ndesigned for at the outset. Brick recycling is labour intensive, as bricks require cleaning prior to reuse, and\ntransport is expensive.\n5.2 Project recommendations towards CE housing\nImportant policy issues and policy responses were identified during the course of the research presented in the\nSections 1–4, which focussed on:\n• the structure of the housing industry, which is split between HCI detached housing and MUATCI multi-unit\napartment housing\n• the availability of data that can be used to map and analyse the flow of materials into and out of the housing system\n• design and onsite decisions about material choice and material reuse for low-rise and multi-unit apartment\nhousing construction\n• the institutional arrangements of manufactured material supply chains that supply materials to housing\nindustry builders.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 73", "text_len": 4061, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "61.Building materials in a circular economy.pdf", "page_num": 80, "text": "5. Policy recommendations\nThe following areas for policy development were identified, and preliminary ideas for their further development\nare outlined.\n• Materials data collection and analysis: The research identified significant gaps in data necessary for\nunderstanding the flow of materials used in the construction of housing, materials already in the housing\nsystem, construction and disassembly waste, and reuse. The Australian Housing Data Portal established by\nthe CSIRO has made considerable progress in the development of a data system, but better builder reporting\nis required. Future initiatives should include the digital recording of material flows through ABDs and material\npassports, supporting stock in-use and materials tracking over the lifespan of dwellings. Data should also\nsupport analysis of materials used at regional and local scales.\n• Incentivising disassembly and reuse: It is difficult for building-industry stakeholders to economically justify\ndisassembly and reuse. Policy development should focus on incentivising disassembly for material reuse,\nas well as encouraging other ways to reduce embodied energy through material selection and the use of\nlocal products that require less transportation. Creating reuse markets within Australia is important, but\ngiven global supply chains it is likely that these markets will connect with international markets. Ensuring\nthat local building-industry stakeholders are not penalised by markets that do not value waste may require\nconsideration of border-adjustment regulation.\n• Regulation for low carbon: The NCC is a performance-based code that sets minimum levels for the safety,\nhealth, amenity, accessibility and sustainability of buildings. Future NCC regulation could expand the scope of\nsustainability regulation to support housing-system decarbonisation. The focus to date has been on reducing\noperational carbon emissions rather than whole-of-life carbon emissions. NCC regulations could lower the\nembodied carbon in material flows and support the reuse of CDW materials. This extended regulatory regime\nwould be supported by simple-to-use digital recording systems for recording material flows. Most recycling\nand reuse regulations focus on end-of-pipe solutions. Regulations should support reuse, rethink, repurpose\nor remanufacture.\n• Tilting investment flows: Policy makers can shape investment flows in ways that support decarbonisation of\nmaterial industries. This form of investment, accompanied by regulation, can support the decarbonisation of\nmaterials manufacturing and stimulate demand for recycled materials. Strategic use of public procurement\nis a complementary form of support. The use of taxation policy can also guide optimisation of resource use in\nmaterial life cycles, including raw materials resource taxes, tax relief on reuse and repair, and carbon credits\nto incentivise reduced emissions.\n• Building capacity: Expanding the pool of people with a knowledge of CE education, training and skill development\nis a high priority. This can be done through curriculum development for use in universities and TAFEs, and in\nprofessional development in-service training that presents CE and embodied carbon concepts in the built\nenvironment. This education and training program would focus on topics such as materials manufacturing,\ndigital recording of material flows, material supply chains, materials innovation, construction, maintenance\nand deconstruction processes, building-industry institutional arrangements and emissions reduction policy.\n• Supply-chain decarbonisation planning: Building-materials supply chains are complex. They involve different\nactors that are often uncoordinated and have conflicting interests, including manufacturers, distributors, retailers,\nregulators, professional consultants, contractors, subcontractors and social movement organisations. There\nis a case for establishing housing-industry supply-chain councils. Council members would be drawn from\nindustry and professional associations and civil society social movement organisations, including relevant\nunions. Each council, supported by a federal government industry agency, would support a deliberative\nprocess that aims at developing a supply-chain decarbonisation plan.\n5.3 Final remarks\nIt is clear from the research that support from the residential housing industry for the integration of CE into the\nresidential housing material supply chains is limited. A significant government policy effort and willingness by the\nindustry to support a transition towards CE ways of working will be required.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 74", "text_len": 4662, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Policy recommendations\nThe public policy focus to date has been largely about regulating the industry to improve the energy efficiency\nof new houses and apartments. Implementing a higher standard has been a long, drawn-out process, where the\nhousing industry has sought to slow down the implementation of higher standards.\nA move to a CE-driven housing industry will require substantial whole of industry change, including the housing\nindustry and its supply chains. However, there is a new imperative that will flow from the new commitment by the\nAustralian Government to legislate higher emission-reduction targets.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has signalled that developed industrialised countries\nwill have to extend their emission abatements beyond switching to renewable electrical energy generation and\nelectrifying motor vehicle transport. The IPCC (2022: 11-6) has observed that until recently ‘industry has so far\nlargely been sheltered from the impacts of climate policy and carbon pricing due to concerns for competitiveness\nand carbon leakage’.\nThe IPCC has now made it clear that industry faces a challenge, and it is worth quoting in conclusion:\nNet-zero CO emissions from the industrial sector are challenging but possible. Reducing industry\n2\nemissions will entail coordinated action throughout value chains to promote all mitigation options,\nincluding demand management, energy and materials efficiency, circular material flows, as well as\nabatement technologies and transformational changes in production processes. (IPCC 2022: SPM-38)\nIt is important to remember that the housing industry is included in the IPCC definition of industry.\nAHURI Final Report No. 402 Building materials in a circular economy 75", "text_len": 1754, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

enhanced market power.\nContemporary examples are:\n• The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) co-invests in new assets with companies which lowers\nthe investment risk in innovative clean energy technologies and assets.\n• Government domestic solar energy household grant programs have supported the formation and growth\nof a domestic solar energy industry.\nSupport, information and voluntary action\nSupport, information and voluntary action programs developed and run by government agencies, NGOs and\ncompanies aim to change the behaviours of target groups.\nContemporary examples are:\n• The GBCA Green Star Home program certifies designs and built outcomes that meet set criteria.\n• States and territories provide households with information about the energy efficiency of dwellings such\nas mandatory energy efficiency rating (ACT), and the Victorian Residential Efficiency Scorecard Initiative\nnow being rolled out nationally.\n• Environmental Product Disclosures (EPDs) are standardised and verified documents presenting the re-\nsults of product life cycle analyses.\n• Programs, such as the US based Al Gore led Climate Reality Project, Women’s Environmental Leader-\nship Australia (WELA), Climate Action Network Australia (CANA) and the Climate Leaders Coalition (CLC),\nare training and supporting business and community leaders to be educators and take action to
