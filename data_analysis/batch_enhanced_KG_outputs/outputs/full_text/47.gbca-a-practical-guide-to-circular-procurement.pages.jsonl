At the end of a building’s\ncurrent use , these scenarios guide the audit process and help determine\nwhich materials can be recovered, reused, or recycled, maximising value\nand minimising waste.\nBackcasting supports EOU scenarios by establishing a vision for the\nbuilding’s lifecycle and desired circular outcomes like zero waste or\nmaximal material recovery. Starting with this vision, the process works\nbackwards to pinpoint necessary actions to realise these goals, especially\nduring initial project phases such as design and planning. This ensures all\ndecisions regarding materials, systems, and construction methods are\naligned with long-term sustainability objectives, embedding circular\nprinciples from the outset and guiding the project towards its circular\neconomy goals.\nA practical guide to circular procurement in buildings: For new buildings and major refurbishments 46", "text_len": 2932, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
