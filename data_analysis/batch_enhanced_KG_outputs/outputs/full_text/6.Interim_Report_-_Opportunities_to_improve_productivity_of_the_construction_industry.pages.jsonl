Generally, one or two conflicts or\nmiscalculations can be managed by consumers, industry and/or government to smooth out or ameliorate the\nadverse or unintended outcomes.\nIn the case of the current Queensland construction industry, several of these factors have become or are, long\nstanding intractable issues. However, what makes the current environment notable is that almost all these factors\nare occurring at the same time.\nDue to the confluence of these issues, the usual policy responses are no longer as effective, stakeholders are\nfrustrated, and some industry participants are opting to leave the Queensland market or the industry altogether.\nEach of these outcomes reinforce the enormity of the current productivity challenge.\nFollowing the receipt of the terms of reference on 24 April 2025, the Queensland Productivity Commission\ncommenced an initial round of consultation with key stakeholders and called for submissions and comments on\nmatters relating to the terms of reference.\nThe level of interest from stakeholders has been very high and the Queensland Productivity Commission sincerely\nthanks all participants for their contributions to this inquiry to date.\nThis interim report sets out the Queensland Productivity Commission’s initial analysis and research, key issues\nraised by stakeholders and potential areas for further analysis. This is a point in time report. That is, the\nQueensland Productivity Commission is keen to hear from stakeholders on whether its understanding of the issues\nand impact they are having on productivity is correct. Furthermore, due to the overwhelming level of feedback, the\nQueensland Productivity Commission will continue to review the information provided and further consider the\nissues raised by stakeholders.\nThis interim report also provides an opportunity for a further round of consultation.\nDespite the enormity of the challenge, stakeholders have indicated they are keen to find solutions to increase\nproductivity in the construction industry and deliver better outcomes for Queenslanders.\nThe Queensland Productivity Commission looks forward to hearing from, and continuing to work with,\nstakeholders on this important issue.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 1", "text_len": 2828, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Although there have been\nperiods of growth, labour productivity today is only 5 per cent higher than it was in 1994-95. In\ncomparison, labour productivity in the market economy grew by 65 per cent over the same period.\n• While there are difficulties in assessing more recent changes in productivity, it appears that, since\n2018, construction industry productivity has declined by around 9 per cent. This means the industry\ntoday needs 9 per cent more labour than it did in 2018, to produce the same level of output.\n• The causes of slow productivity growth appear to be related to two main factors:\n– Growing regulatory burdens — these burdens cut across land use, building activity and labour\nmarkets and seem to explain much of the long run slowdown in construction productivity.\n– Sub-optimal procurement practices — productivity losses since 2018 have been associated with a\ngrowing government capital works program and increasingly interventionist procurement policies.\n• If Queensland is to meet the needs of its growing population, match infrastructure commitments and\ndeliver the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic games, productivity across the industry will need to improve.\n• This interim report proposes a reform program to improve productivity across the industry, focusing\non four key areas:\n– Reforming procurement — there are opportunities to rationalise the current suite of procurement\npolicies, including the permanent removal of the best practice industry conditions, and to improve\nproject selection, sequencing and contracting.\n– Improving land use regulation — there are opportunities to improve the operation of the housing\nmarket by reducing unnecessary regulation of building form, streamlining approvals processes and\nundertaking reforms to increase opportunities for development, with a focus on increasing density.\n– Improving the regulation of building activity — there are opportunities to improve regulation under\nthe National Construction Code, financial regulations, and the operation of workplace health and\nsafety regulation, as well as removing regulatory barriers to modern methods of construction.\n– Improving labour market operation — given labour market shortages across the economy, it will be\nchallenging to increase the construction labour force. However, there are opportunities to improve\nits operation through reforms to occupational licensing and reconsidering the requirement for\nlabour hire licensing.\n• There are also opportunities for the Queensland Government to commit to better regulatory and\nprocurement practices. There are several examples where governments have announced regulatory\nchanges or committed to large infrastructure projects without undertaking due diligence, consulting\nwith stakeholders or ensuring agency or regulator capacity exists to effectively manage.\n• Although there are solutions, the pathway to better productivity will not be easy or immediate. There\nare no silver bullets or quick fixes, and improving matters will take concerted effort to restore\nconfidence and enable investment in the housing and other infrastructure we need.\n• The Commission is seeking stakeholder feedback on this proposed reform program before we prepare\nour final report for the Queensland Government.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 6\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | Key points |  | \n |  | • Queensland's construction industry is facing significant challenges, with rising levels of demand, a tight |  | \n |  | labour market, ongoing supply chain issues, and declining productivity. |  | \n |  | • Productivity growth in Queensland’s conduction industry has been weak.

{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 10, "text": "Summary\nWhat stakeholders told us\nThe construction industry is grappling with multiple challenges, making it difficult to deliver the current pipeline of\nwork. Stakeholders made it clear these challenges need to be confronted and addressed, if industry is to deliver\nthe large pipeline of work ahead, and address Queensland's housing shortage.\nIndustry told us it is weighed down by excessive regulation that is confusing to navigate, duplicative, unnecessarily\nprescriptive, and often inconsistently or poorly applied with little oversight.\nThere are considerable issues of uncertainty arising from the inconsistent application of technical\nrequirements throughout Queensland as well as the regulated processes that apply in an\ninconsistent manner across local government areas in Queensland. There is no singular legislative\nreference to understand what is required in relation to construction, with overlapping requirements\narising in separate Acts and subordinate instruments, many of which are difficult to locate,\nparticularly those which arise through individual local government policy adoption. (Australian\nInstitute of Building Surveyors, sub. 49, p. 3)\nThe construction sector in Australia operates within one of the country’s most heavily regulated\nenvironments ... However, stakeholders across the sector consistently report that while these\nregulations are fundamentally important, the current regulatory burden has become a significant\nbarrier to innovation, efficiency, and adaptability. (Queensland University of Technology, sub. 73,\np. 13)\nFurther, constant regulatory changes (some of which were retrospectively applied) have made it challenging for\nstakeholders to keep pace with change, with many arguing for better consultation and greater predictability.\nA fragmented and inconsistent regulatory environment creates delays, increases costs, and\nundermines innovation. Clearer, more predictable systems are essential to improving construction\nproductivity. (Australian Institute of Architects, sub. 26, p. 4)\nIn the housing market, slow approvals, convoluted regulatory obligations, restrictive zoning exacerbated by\nvariations across local governments, and constantly changing requirements, are hindering the supply of land and\nhousing where it is needed. This makes it more costly to deliver housing and prevents innovative solutions like\nmodular and offsite construction techniques being adopted more widely.\nThe failure to understand and appreciate the makeup of the industry and the associated distinct\nbusiness models utilised to undertake residential construction in Queensland, has in HIA’s view,\nled to numerous examples of regulatory overreach by all levels of government, creating a\nregulatory environment that is overly complex and extremely difficult for the predominantly small\nbusiness players who dominate the industry to navigate, leading to costly inefficiencies in the\ndelivery of new homes. (Housing Industry Association (HIA), sub. 32, p. 2)\nCouncil policies on height limits, lot minimums and character protections in residential zoning all\nseverely limit the developable land to a handful of large sites, particularly in the inner city where\ntransport access is barely relevant for access to employment. (Greater Brisbane, sub. 11, p. 2)\nWe are a small property developer who have been working in the middle ring northwest suburbs\nof Brisbane over the last 18 years. In that time, we have focused on the design and production of\naffordable homes, townhouses & units, and can attest to a lived experience of all of the issues that\nhave gradually mounted to now make producing affordable homes essentially unachievable.\n(Camalee Investments, sub. 12, p. 1)\nQueensland Productivity Commission 8", "text_len": 3736, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 11, "text": "Summary\nThese issues are compounded by inconsistencies between planning and building codes that has led to rising\nregulation imposed at the local government level, often with unclear benefit. This has resulted in unnecessary\ncomplexity and uncertainty, increased administration and overhead costs, restricted scale, and increased the\nchances that builders need to complete reworks to rectify non-compliant work.\nThe current framework is riddled with confusion requiring complex and headache inducing zig zag\nreading between 2 legislative branches which contain multiple conflicting and similar definitions\nand numerous other subordinate documents which differ from region to region. (Erin Dunn, sub.\n64, p. 1)\nFurther, there is often poor knowledge of regulatory instruments by approval bodies leading to adversarial\nengagement and inconsistent decision making.\nIt was disgraceful the delays that were imposed on us by competing Brisbane City Council\ndepartments, that cost us many hundreds of thousands of dollars extra in increased construction\nand financing costs ... The uncertainty means I would never do another development in Brisbane\ndespite my extensive experience in the building industry. (John Tozer, sub. 18, p. 1)\nThese issues also create challenges for non-housing development, with stakeholders noting the different\napplication of regulation across local government areas is creating unnecessary costs.\nConsistent standards make it easier for contractors to optimise available materials and reduce the\namount of time that needs to be spent on adjusting designs, materials, and processes. In order to\nbe able to recycle materials like asphalt, aggregates, or steel, there has to be harmonised standards\nbetween jurisdictions. … One example of standards differing between jurisdictions is Brisbane City\nCouncil taking a different approach to the use of gravel in pavement construction than other\ncouncils in Southeast Queensland. (Civil Contractors Federation Queensland Ltd., pers. comm.)\nOn larger sites, including high rise apartments and civil and heavy engineering projects, stakeholders told the\nCommission productivity has declined significantly in recent years, with many sites struggling to operate more than\nthree days per week. Stakeholders say this is because of stop work conditions in enterprise bargaining agreements\n(EBAs). All stakeholders reinforced the importance of safety, but suggested workplace health and safety responses\nare not proportionate to risk, with entire worksites sometimes being shut down over isolated instances or being\nenacted as cover to achieve other industrial outcomes.\nwe support the underlying principles of BPIC and ROE provisions. Their original purpose—to\nstrengthen safety, ensure fair employment conditions, and make construction a more attractive\ncareer path—remains fundamentally sound. However, the way these provisions are currently\nimplemented on many large-scale projects has become overly onerous, producing frequent, whole-\nsite stoppages even when the underlying issue is confined to a single zone and work could continue\nsafely elsewhere. (anonymous, pers. comm.)\nThe current system of largely fixed RDOs, with no work on Weekends and Shutdown Weeks, has a\nsignificant impact on productivity, subcontractor cash flow, and workplace control. The most\nnotable impact in recent months has been a 50% reduction in productivity, excluding inclement\nweather. (Workforce Advisory Lawyers, sub. 30, p. 2)\nWork Health and Safety regulation is an area that has become increasingly weaponised by certain\nunion officials and it is being used to achieve industry outcomes that have no relationship to the\nhealth and safety of workers.

{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 12, "text": "Summary\nThe complexity of current workplace health and safety conditions for workers and contractors was also noted. This\ncomplexity has resulted in responses being at times heavy handed, as this ensures compliance is achieved\nirrespective of the costs incurred.\nWe sometimes encounter excessive and irrelevant safety requirements. For example, when\ninstalling a temporary fence in a shopping centre car park, our staff were required to complete a\n60+ page safety induction covering high-risk topics like high-voltage work and mechanical\nventilation — none of which applied to our task. (anonymous, comment 4)\nQueensland Government procurement practices have been identified as playing a key role in poor productivity.\nProcurement policies are viewed as being excessively rigid and prescriptive and difficult to navigate, with poor\nallocation of risk. As a result, they discourage innovation and prevent competition, particularly from smaller and\nregional firms.\nAs Tier 2 contractors within larger project delivery frameworks, our members face unique\nchallenges where procurement processes designed for Tier 1 head contractors create\ndisproportionate administrative burdens for specialised surfacing services. Notably for example\nwhile Best Practice Industry Conditions have been paused, the underlying Queensland\nProcurement Policy and Best Practice Principles continue to create compliance frameworks that\naffect productivity. (Australian Flexible Pavement Association, sub. 54, p.13)\nThe key issues concerning Queensland procurement processes and contracts in the construction\nindustry, revolve around their excessive length and cost, the complexity of requirements, their role\nas barriers to innovation, problematic risk allocation, and the need for government leadership in\ndriving reform for increased productivity. (Queensland Major Contractors Association, sub. 66, p.\n25)\nOur members have reported that, when assisting government entities (e.g., local governments\ndelivering State—funded projects, statutory bodies and government-owned corporations) with the\nconduct of procurement processes for construction work, it can be difficult for those entities to\nidentify, understand and properly apply the various State government procurement policies in\npractice. (Queensland Law Society, sub. 63, p. 2)\nThe introduction of Best Practice Industry Conditions (BPICs) in 2018, are noted by stakeholders as a key\ncontributor to poor productivity and competition. Although BPICs have been paused, the market impacts will be\ndifficult to unwind as most of BPIC conditions are now reflected in the EBAs of most large construction firms.\nBPIC has reduced the attractiveness of Queensland to contractors as it has resulted in delivery\ncosts being substantially higher than other jurisdictions with little appetite from clients to accept\nthese higher costs. Further, non-EBA employers are reluctant to enter the Queensland market\nwhere there will be pressure to meet the benchmark that has been set through BPIC. (Australian\nConstructors Association, sub. 39, p. 22)\nThe pre-qualification requirement had the practical effect of requiring these head contractors (and\ntheir subcontractors) to enter a union enterprise agreement … The combined effect of the BPP and\nBPIC model was to restrict competition, value for money and productivity. (Master Builders\nQueensland, sub. 43, p. 11)\nThe majority of the industrial relations responsibility for industry leadership rests with the\nQueensland Government as the most significant client … The Government must communicate with\nthe builders, workers, and unions to deliver a fair private-sector agreement and a discounted public\nworks agreement. Government action is now needed to secure Queensland's future, foster\nproductivity, lower public costs and provide leadership through state government procurement.\n(Workforce Advisory Lawyers, sub. 30, p. 2)\nQueensland Productivity Commission 10", "text_len": 3930, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 13, "text": "Summary\nAside from the need to increase the capacity of the market by lifting productivity, there is general agreement that a\ngreater level of coordination (and capability) is also required across government procurement and capital\ninvestment activities. Better coordination and market analysis will reduce the likelihood of public sector projects\ncrowding out the market or exacerbating investment peaks and troughs. It would also support certainty of\ninvestment (especially in regional areas), boost confidence to invest in staff (e.g. apprentices) and innovation.\nThere is broad agreement there are not enough workers to deliver the forward investment pipeline. While there is\na significant pipeline of apprentices, there is concern about low completion rates and also whether apprentices and\ngraduates are being equipped with the right skills. Stakeholders also suggested that skills shortages could be at\nleast partially addressed by better recognition of prior learning, including for migrants and those leaving the\narmed forces, and participation in the automatic mutual recognition of interstate licence holders.\nPersistent skills shortages across all specialist trades represent a major constraint on the industry's\ncapacity to deliver on Queensland’s significant infrastructure agenda and contribute to overall\neconomic growth. Coordinated and strategic efforts are urgently needed to promote careers in the\nspecialist trades as viable, rewarding, and technologically advanced pathways. This includes\nimproving apprenticeship attraction and completion rates, and creating accessible avenues for\nupskilling and new entrants, including those from underrepresented groups and mature-aged\ncareer changers. (AMCA, NECA & NFIA, sub. 47, p. 6)\nStakeholders told us that skills shortages are exacerbated by licensing that is failing to keep pace with industry\nneeds, with many requirements seemingly aimed at restricting entry or competition rather than improving safety or\nquality. At the same time, stakeholders told us that licensing requirements fail to provide efficient mechanisms to\nkeep workers in the construction industry up to date with requirements and obligations, provide opportunities to\ndevelop the skills they need for a modern workplace or help prevent costly defects from occurring.\nThe current licensing rules require all pest controllers in Queensland to hold a QBCC occupational\nlicence—even if their work has nothing to do with building or construction. (Australian\nEnvironmental Pest Manager's Association, sub. 61, p. 1)\nFinally, stakeholders called for greater confidence for the industry. This includes calls for greater regulatory clarity\nand certainty, efficient and effective enforcement of obligations and improved safety, both in terms of the work\nconducted but also to ensure that workplaces are free from harassment and intimidation.\n…the biggest challenge for detached home builders is the supply of shovel ready land, whilst the\nbiggest challenge for the low-med rise multi-unit builders is gaining a commercially viable\napproval from Local Government, and for high rise Apartment developers the uncertainty about\nthe cost of construction driven by industrial relations and labour shortages. (HIA, sub. 32, p. 2)\nConsistent, transparent, and effective enforcement of licensing and technical standards by the\nQBCC is crucial for maintaining a level playing field and public confidence. However, industry\nmembers report challenges in obtaining clear and timely advice and concerns about the\nconsistency of enforcement actions.

There are exceptions and there have been periods in which construction productivity grew quickly,\nsuggesting the construction industry is not inherently unproductive, but has become less so more recently.\nAlthough empirical evidence on the causes of slow productivity growth is incomplete, it suggests that regulation is\nlikely to have played a key role:\n• Evidence from the United States of America and New Zealand suggests the introduction of more restrictive land\nuse regulation may have made it more difficult and expensive to construct housing and other buildings.\n• Research suggests there have been significant increases in the complexity of building regulation, which, in turn\nhas increased overheads and construction costs.\n• Regulatory design, including regional variations, seem to have created incentives that keep the industry\nfragmented and dominated by smaller firms, who are less likely to innovate and tend to have lower productivity.\n• Where regulators have poor incentives, or are underfunded to perform their roles, this can result in unnecessary\ndelays, high administrative costs and poor oversight, all of which can undermine productivity.\nThis empirical evidence is consistent with the evidence provided by stakeholders. Examples were provided of poor\nregulatory design and regulator behaviour across a broad range of areas, including fragmented regulations\nrelating to building activity, slow approval times, disproportionate responses to risk and, in some cases regulations\nthat do not appear necessary. There was also a general sense from many stakeholders that the increase and pace\nof regulatory change was too fast for the industry to keep up with.\nRegulations have at times been introduced without following good practice (that is, the application of the\nQueensland Government Better Regulation policy or equivalent and demonstrating the proposed change will\ndeliver the greatest net benefit to the community). For example, recent changes to the National Construction Code\n(NCC) have been adopted without a case being established that they would provide a net benefit to the\ncommunity. Similarly, Queensland introduced its trust accounts framework without undertaking a regulatory\nimpact assessment. Poor regulatory practices can create unnecessary costs, risk unintended consequences and\nundermine confidence in regulatory processes.\nWhile regulatory issues seem to be a key driver of poor performance over longer time periods, more recent\nproductivity declines seem to have been materially impacted by policy choices relating to Queensland Government\nprocurement.\nThe Queensland Government has a large and growing capital program, but insufficient attention has been given to\nhow procurement practices or new projects are impacting the market. This has been exacerbated by poor project\nselection, with commitments made before projects have been fully costed or sometimes even establishing that\nthey are required or the best solution.\nGovernment procurement practices, particularly BPICs, have created unnecessary inefficiencies in the way\ngovernment projects are constructed. These inefficiencies are being observed beyond government projects, with\nBPIC-like conditions now seemingly embedded in the broader industry through the EBAs of most Tier 1 firms and\nmany sub-contractors. These conditions appear to have reduced productivity, with proponents telling us many\nsites are now only operating three days per week.\nPoor productivity outcomes are affecting the commercial viability of the industry, including the residential and\nnon-residential markets.

For example, the Queensland\nGovernment previously established Building Queensland as an independent statutory body to improve the quality\nof business cases and investment decisions. In New South Wales (NSW), Infrastructure NSW provides independent\nand expert advice on the identification, prioritisation and oversight of the capital programme. It also develops\ninfrastructure policy reform options to drive a sustained programme of project delivery.\nThe Commission is considering options to improve project selection and sequencing, and would like to hear\nstakeholder views on:\n• the extent to which various institutional, assessment or governance arrangements can be effective mechanisms\nfor improving decision making on public sector infrastructure\n• design features which are likely to make any institutional, assessment or governance arrangements most\neffective.\nRemoving multiple objectives from procurement policies and focusing on value for money\nSelecting projects based on value for money is important for ensuring that taxpayer money is spent on\ninfrastructure that delivers the greatest net benefits to the community. When projects are selected based on other\nmetrics, this is likely to result in lower productivity and higher project costs — which must be funded either\nthrough higher taxes (now or in the future) or reduced spending in other areas.\nQueensland Government procurement policies have moved beyond a focus on achieving value for money for the\ncommunity. Current Queensland Government procurement policies:\n• Impose numerous conditions on contractors that are unrelated to value for money — while the objectives of\nmany of these conditions may be beneficial, it is not clear procurement policies are the most efficient policy\ninstrument to deliver these objectives.\n• Seem unnecessarily complex and prescriptive for contractors, with more than 15 overarching and subordinate\npolicies, totalling more than 1,000 pages. Stakeholders have told us this imposes a significant administrative\nburden on tenderers and their subcontractors, and disproportionately impacts smaller firms, particularly those in\nregional areas.\n• Contain ambiguities that reduce transparency by providing procuring agencies a certain level of flexibility and\ndiscretion in procurement decision-making. While some discretion can be beneficial, stakeholders told us this\ncreates uncertainty, may have restricted the entry of some participants, particularly those in remote and regional\nareas, and introduces opportunities for subjective decision-making.\nThese policies appear to have incentivised contractors in some sectors to reorient their priorities away from\ndelivering projects at lowest cost. This has resulted in inflated bid prices and lower site productivity, culminating in\nelevated project and delay costs for the Queensland Government, and ultimately the community.\nThere are likely to be benefits from ensuring Queensland Government procurement policies have a clearer focus\non achieving the greatest value for money (i.e. whole of life costs and performance outcomes) for the Queensland\ncommunity.

{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 23, "text": "Summary\nBest Practice Industry Conditions\nThere is little evidence to support maintaining the BPICs in their current form. While Queensland Government has\nannounced a pause on BPICs, there appears to be a strong case for permanently removing the policy.\nA principal rationale for introducing BPICs was to improve worker safety. However, data suggest there have been\nno material improvements to safety outcomes across the Queensland construction industry since their\nintroduction. A preliminary review suggests that many of the workplace health and safety provisions in BPICs are\neither covered already in existing legislation and codes of practice or relevant awards.\nStakeholders from across the industry told us that, since their introduction in 2018, BPICs have caused a significant\nslowdown in site productivity on public construction sites and had enabled problematic conditions to creep into\nthe private sector, including through EBAs. Some stakeholders argue that BPICs have only had a limited impact on\nwages, however assessing competing views is difficult given the close links between BPICs and EBAs.\nThe Commission has undertaken modelling to assess the economic impact of BPICs, if they remained in place\ngoing forward.3 This modelling shows that, if BPICs were in place to 2029-30:\n• They are likely to increase project costs by between 10 and 25 per cent, depending on the assumptions used.\n• There are likely to be effects on other parts of the construction industry, with a significant impact on the housing\nmarket. The analysis suggests a continuation of BPICs may result in up to 26,500 fewer homes being constructed\nand rents being 8.3 per cent higher than they otherwise would be.\n• While the modelling shows there are significant benefits to construction workers (predominantly from higher\nwages and reduced working hours), the policy is likely to impose net costs on the community of between $5.7\nand $20.6 billion.\n• Even if wages are assumed to be unaffected by BPICs, the net costs are still significant due to lower on-site\nproductivity such as site stoppages. The modelling suggests under this scenario the net economic impacts\nwould be between $4.4 and $18.4 billion over the modelled period.\nWhile there are significant uncertainties in the modelling, the key results hold under a wide range of plausible\nassumptions.

Further, industry\nstakeholders told us that, given the operation of the market, without further action there may be few incentives for\nfirms to negotiate more productivity-favourable conditions in future EBAs.\nOn this basis, the removal of BPICs alone is unlikely to provide the necessary reset required to shift the\nconstruction industry to an environment conducive to productivity growth.\nThere appears to be a consensus on the need for government, industry and unions to develop mechanisms for\nreviving site productivity without compromising safety outcomes.\nOne option put forward by several stakeholders is for a negotiated set of revised industry conditions to incentivise\nbetter outcomes on government projects and to form the basis for future EBA negotiations.\nStakeholder submissions suggested a new set of procurement requirements for large infrastructure projects, could\ninclude provisions aimed at ensuring any future workplace agreements:\n• do not include unnecessary productivity limiting clauses\n• restrict the pass through of EBA conditions to subcontractors\n• include standardised core clauses to reduce administrative burden\n• include right of entry provisions that prevent the abuse of power by either employers or worker representatives\n• maintain equal opportunity hiring policies\n• provide clear guidelines for managing contentious workplace health and safety issues, such as work during wet\nand hot weather events, processes for proportionate responses to workplace health and safety incidents, and\nrequirements for site shutdowns.\nStakeholders suggested any new policies should be negotiated between unions, industry and government.\nSome stakeholders also argued that the establishment of an independent tribunal to provide a confidential\npathway for resolving disputes is needed to help reset the industry and remove poor behaviours that prevent\ncompetition for government projects.\nThe Commission would like to hear from stakeholders on what options could provide the necessary reset, how\nthese options could be implemented, what support mechanisms might be required and the extent to which it\nwould improve productivity on construction projects funded by the Queensland Government, without\ncompromising site safety or build quality.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 22", "text_len": 2619, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

However, emerging literature suggests land use regulation has\nbeen a significant impediment to productivity in the construction industry.\nMechanisms by which land use regulation can impede productivity include:\n• restrictions on housing density, such as minimum lot size, height restrictions and floor area ratios, which impede\nthe achievement of scale economies and innovation\n• design conditions which add to the cost of construction, but do not provide a commensurate improvement in\nthe building quality desired by consumers\n• approval processes that cause delays and uncertainty, resulting in idling of resources, inefficient sequencing of\nactivities and higher financial costs\n• consultation mechanisms that encourage adversarial engagement between developers and existing residents\ninstead of attempting to find mutually beneficial outcomes.\nThere is evidence that land use regulation in Queensland, and planning regulation in particular, is less efficient than\nit could be, with the result that it unnecessarily constrains construction productivity. Stakeholders told us that:\n• land use regulations are inconsistent and difficult to navigate, creating significant uncertainty for industry, and\noften result in expensive legal proceedings\n• approval processes are excessively bureaucratic, slow, confusing and duplicative, and regulators, particularly\nlocal governments, have limited accountability\n• 'back and forth' processes and poor coordination or alignment in interpretation within some local governments\nmeant that expensive remedial work or unnecessary building works were more common than they should be\n• good building design is often sacrificed to meet unnecessary regulatory requirements\n• land is often released in locations that do not reflect market realities.\nStakeholders told us that, because of this, development and housing costs are much higher than they otherwise\nwould be, with many developments becoming untenable, particularly for affordable housing types.\nWhile some reforms have been undertaken by the Queensland Government, these alone are unlikely to be\nsufficient to deliver the housing outcomes desired by the community.\nImproving the design of regulation\nSeveral stakeholders have noted there are significant inconsistencies between the Building Act 1975 (Building Act)\nand the Planning Act 2016 (Planning Act). Further, there appear to be significant inconsistencies between local\ngovernments in the way they interpret and apply legislation.\nAs a result, there is a plethora of requirements in planning schemes that impose significant costs on construction\n(and the broader community). While many of these requirements provide some benefit, few have been tested to\nensure these benefits justify the costs they impose on the community, including whether they are likely to have any\nunintended consequences.\nRequirements that appear to impose unnecessarily high costs include:\n• Minimum parking regulations — these regulations do not appear to sufficiently reflect resident needs or\npreferences, are applied rigidly and are likely to significantly increase the cost of construction, particularly for\nurban infill.\n• Height restrictions — while height restrictions often reflect community preferences, they are applied rigidly and\nhave been shown to cause significant loss of greenspace and prevent more efficient use of land.\n• Blanket character protections — these protections are often imposed across large areas, restrict density and add\nto the cost of construction, but evidence suggests they do not necessarily preserve heritage.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 24", "text_len": 3811, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Where local\nvariations are required (for example, due to climatic conditions), these could be standardised in the Queensland\nDevelopment Code, or, if a local government considers there is a need to make a further variation, it could be\nrequired to demonstrate that the variation would generate a net benefit to the broader community.\n• Developing standards for siting and design. The Queensland Government is currently progressing a Queensland\nHousing Code to provide design and siting standards for detached houses on single lots. Similar standards\ncould be developed for smaller attached housing developments.\n• Introducing requirements for local governments to remove regulatory conditions unless it can be demonstrated\nthat these have undergone a proper assessment of their likely costs and benefits.\nThe Commission is seeking further stakeholder comment on these matters.\nSeveral stakeholders also suggested that Economic Development Queensland (EDQ) remove unnecessary or\nduplicative requirements from plans in priority development areas, including those relating to affordable housing\nand energy efficiency as they have been shown to be inefficient instruments to achieve their stated outcomes,\nincreasing costs and uncertainty.\nImproving approval processes\nApproval processes can create delays and uncertainty which, in turn, can increase construction costs by causing\nidling of labour and capital and higher financing and other holding costs.\nA lack of publicly available data on local government performance, makes it difficult to formally assess whether\napproval processes are working as efficiently as they should. However:\n• The Productivity Commission found that timelines for major housing developments can stretch for ten or more\nyears, and even after approvals are granted, delays can continue as projects seek construction certificates and\nwait for essential infrastructure connections.\n• There is some anecdotal evidence that approval processes, particularly for developments that are not code\nassessable, may be excessively onerous. For example, developers have asserted that approvals for townhouses\ncan require more than 30 approvals from councils and statutory bodies.\n• Stakeholder submissions provided numerous examples of a convoluted approvals system that is plagued by a\nlack of accountability, confusing approvals processes and uncertainties that create unnecessary delays and\nrequirements for re-worked designs and plans.\nAlthough the Commission is seeking further evidence on problems in approval processes, it seems there are likely\nto be benefits from streamlining processes.

New Zealand recently enacted reforms providing a private\nauthority the ability to issue development approvals for low-risk housing proposals.\n• Providing an alternative development assessment pathway for significant housing developments — increased\ncentralisation of some planning processes could lead to more efficient and timely processing of planning\napplications. Options could include expanding the remit of an existing government body such as the State\nAssessment and Referral Agency (SARA) or using independent assessment panels, like those used in Western\nAustralia.\n• Reviewing the Building Act and Planning Act to ensure that statutory timeframes are adequate — stakeholders\nraised issues with building approvals lapsing due to the time taken to gain other necessary approvals.\n• Improving information on approval processes — increasing publicly available information on the performance\nof local government planning and development processes is likely to improve accountability, provide guidance\nto developers and help the Queensland Government establish policy responses to incentivise improved\noutcomes (such as setting statutory timeframes). Several stakeholders have suggested that an independent\ngrowth monitoring authority is required to monitor, report and advise on the implementation and performance\nof housing supply targets across Queensland.\n• Simplifying approval requirements — as in other jurisdictions, measures could be introduced to remove the\nneed to gain approval for certain designs or services if they are deemed to be low risk. For example, the\nVictorian Government recently removed the need for planning approval for a single dwelling on a lot of 300\nsquare metres or more, and the Tasmanian Government recently announced that a range of plumbing services\nare ‘deemed to comply’ as they constitute low risk.\n• Using technology to streamline approvals — there may be opportunities to utilise technology, such as digital\nplanning and development assessment to improve the efficiency, accuracy and transparency of planning\nprocesses.\nSeveral stakeholders raised concerns about infrastructure needing to be in place prior to development occurring.\nWhile it is beyond the scope of this inquiry to assess infrastructure planning and sequencing, there appears to be a\nstrong case to review the regulation of infrastructure charges to ensure they are set efficiently to support\ninfrastructure development and incentivise efficient utilisation of existing infrastructure.\nThe Commission has not assessed environmental approval processes as these are predominantly a matter for the\nAustralian Government. However, as noted by several stakeholders there are discrepancies in the way that state\nand local government environmental overlays are applied. As such there appears to be opportunities to increase\nconsistency in the way environmental (and other) overlays are applied across local government planning schemes.\nUtilities connection time frames were consistently raised as problematic by stakeholders, with some noting housing\ndelivery being delayed due to mains water and/or electricity not being available.\nFacilitating a greater supply of development rights\nLand use regulation also constrains the supply of housing by imposing limits on density and the supply of\ngreenfield land. These constraints are likely to reduce construction productivity since they limit the scale of\ndevelopment, reduce options for standardisation and restrict development to locations with high infrastructure\ncosts. These constraints are also likely to have significant implications for housing affordability.\nThe supply of development rights (through land releases and upzoning for higher density) need to reflect market\nrealities if they are to be exercised. That is, land supply is only construction ready if it is in locations where people\nwant to live, allow for forms of housing people want to live in and can afford, and have infrastructure already\nconnected or have a feasible pathway for connecting to new infrastructure.\nAcross Queensland, many locations that are close to jobs, amenities and existing infrastructure have restrictive\nzoning. For example, 69 per cent of the land surrounding the high-capacity rail network in southeast Queensland is\nzoned for low density, either explicitly or because it has character overlays that make most development untenable.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 26", "text_len": 4695, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 29, "text": "Summary\nThere are likely to be large benefits from making regulation of land use less restrictive. Commission modelling of\nthe costs and benefits of relaxing zoning in South East Queensland indicates that:\n• Targeted reforms that remove zoning restrictions in well located areas, including around transport hubs, could\ndeliver net benefits to the community up to $48 billion and reduce dwelling price growth by as much as 64 per\ncent.\n• Dispersed zoning reforms to provide more development opportunities both in infill areas and on the urban\nfringe, are projected to reduce dwelling price growth by similar amounts but provide fewer benefits ($18 billion)\nsince they require more expensive infrastructure and deliver less amenity.\nGiven these large potential benefits, there appears to be a strong case for relaxing land use regulations to increase\ndevelopment rights in South East Queensland, particularly those that allow for increased density.\nHowever, under existing arrangements local governments may find it challenging to enact necessary reforms\nwithout the involvement of the State Government. As the costs of development are concentrated locally, while the\nbenefits are dispersed more broadly, local governments, typically do not have strong incentives to implement this\ntype of reform.\nFor this reason, our preliminary recommendations include more direct involvement from the State Government.\nThese preliminary recommendations include:\n• using state powers to remove zoning restrictions in well located areas, such as around transport corridors — this\napproach is currently being used in NSW and has also been successfully used in New Zealand to increase\nhousing supply\n• setting of housing targets for the supply of well-located land (that is suitable to be connected to infrastructure\nand reflects consumer preferences) and providing incentive payments for local governments\n• considering mechanisms to allow residents to opt-in or out of zoning types, to ensure land use better matches\nlocal community preferences — while not used in Australia, various approaches have been used successfully in\noverseas jurisdictions.\nIncentivising change\nWhile there are likely to be large benefits from regulatory reform and less restrictive zoning, a significant\nimpediment to reform can be actual or perceived opposition to development. That can reflect:\n• Current consultation mechanisms not being representative of broader community sentiment. While\ncommunities may be generally supportive of development, neighbouring residents tend to be less supportive\nbecause they incur direct costs. This means, local consultation processes can give insufficient weight to the\nviews of the broader community who are more likely to be supportive of development.\n• Building form being centrally regulated. This means there are few mechanisms to allow development to address\nlocal concerns or reduce costs on existing residents. For example, planning regulation typically specifies building\nheight limits which reduce greenspace and provides few mechanisms for variations to be agreed between\ndevelopers and neighbouring residents.\nThese issues, in turn, can increase opposition to development, or reduce incentives for policy makers to increase\nthe supply of developable land.\nOptions to support enduring reforms include:\n• developing the case for reform and providing information to the public on the benefits of greater density and\nhousing\n• introducing community consultation mechanisms that better reflect broader community views\n• sharing the benefits of development with the community by ensuring developments enhance local\nneighbourhoods\n• better aligning development with community preferences by enabling negotiated regulatory outcomes between\ndevelopers and residents.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 27", "text_len": 3807, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 30, "text": "Summary\nImproving regulation of building activity\nThe construction industry is subject to a wide range of regulations, codes and standards. Like other regulation,\nthese generally seek to support the efficient functioning of markets and improve outcomes for the community.\nRegulation of the construction industry is necessary to protect worker and public safety, protect consumers from\npoor quality products or services, and minimise environmental impacts. Where regulations have a strong rationale\nand are designed and administered well to address the underlying problem, the benefits should outweigh any\ncosts that arise.\nHowever, regulation that is either unnecessary, poorly designed or administered, or has failed to evolve in\nresponse to changing technologies, conditions or consumer preferences can introduce unnecessary costs, distort\neconomic activity and adversely affect productivity.\nStakeholders indicated that regulations are particularly problematic where:\n• there has been a lack of proper assessment, including consultation prior to implementation and assessment of\npossible unintended consequences or regional implications\n• there are differences between jurisdictions, including at the local government level\n• the pace of regulatory change makes it difficult to adapt to, or understand obligations\n• where regulator performance is lacking.\nIn addition to regulatory reforms identified elsewhere in this report, the Commission has identified four key areas\nwhere regulations are either likely to be affecting productivity or where issues have been consistently raised by\nstakeholders. These four areas are:\n• Building codes and standards\n• Financial regulations\n• Regulations affecting modern methods of construction (MMC)\n• Workplace health and safety.\nGiven the volume of evidence on problematic areas of regulation, there may be merit in a more comprehensive\nprogram of review of other sector or occupation specific regulations affecting the building industry.\nBuilding codes and standards\nBuilding codes establish minimum standards for the design, construction, and maintenance of buildings, in areas\nsuch as structural and fire safety, health and sanitation, and light and ventilation. The core rationale for building\ncodes and standards are that, if effectively enforced they:\n• set a baseline of safety and quality that consumers can expect\n• mitigate the risk of building failures and potential hazards that could lead to harm or economic loss.\nBuilding codes can also provide a clear standard against which liability can be assessed, helping ensure that\nbuilders bear the full costs of any issues that arise due to their work.\nOver the last few decades there has been a significant increase in the scope of building codes and standards that\ngo beyond the core rationale of safety and quality. They now cover energy efficiency and accessibility standards\n(through the NCC) and a broad range of aesthetic and other standards (through local government planning\nschemes).\nIndustry stakeholders have expressed concerns about the increasing complexity and cost involved in complying\nwith building codes and standards. These concerns are amplified by poor regulatory processes. For example, recent\nchanges to energy efficiency and accessibility standards in the NCC were adopted despite having been assessed as\nimposing net costs on the community.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 28", "text_len": 3405, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 31, "text": "Summary\nThere is a strong case for Queensland to opt out of any regulatory change, including changes to the NCC, where a\nnet benefit has not been demonstrated.\nWhile there are benefits from national harmonisation, this will only be achieved where there is wide-spread\nagreement on both the purpose, the process for making changes and broad application of the NCC. The NCC's\noriginal purpose was to provide the minimum standards required to establish safety and quality expectations on\nbuilding work. Further, changes to the NCC were to be made on the basis that there were demonstrated net\nbenefits to the community.\nGiven recent changes to the NCC failed both tests, the Commission's preliminary position is that Queensland\nshould opt out of the recent NCC energy efficiency and accessibility standards. Such a change would not restrict\nthe market, that is, builders or consumers, from adopting the stronger energy efficiency or accessibility standards\nset out in the current NCC if they believe there are benefits from doing so.\nAs noted in the previous section, there is also a strong case for Queensland to adopt a uniform development code\nand address inconsistencies between planning and building legislation that create regulatory overlap and\nduplication.\nStakeholders have also expressed concerns about the rate at which building standards and code changes occur,\nand provided several examples of licensing, training and enforcement not keeping pace with these changes.\nSimilarly, stakeholders told us the rapid pace of change was increasing the rate of building defects and rectification\nworks, sometimes simply because a builder was unaware of a new requirement.\nAs such there appears to be a strong case for either moving to a longer time between allowable NCC amendments\nto the Queensland Development Code or imposing a moratorium on any future changes to allow the industry to\nadapt to recent changes.\nA review of the stock of building regulation\nOne of the few strategies that has shown to be effective in improving the quality of regulation is the evaluation of\nthe ‘stock’ of regulation that has accumulated over time, to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.\nEvaluation can effectively target the key issue — regulatory design — and provide a robust assessment of whether\na regulation supports the public interest or not. Management of the stock of regulation involves retaining the\ngood parts of regulation, while removing or amending those parts that are no longer fit for purpose.\nGiven the cumulative regulatory burden of building regulation, interactions between regulation, and the level of\ntechnical complexity, there is likely to be value in undertaking a targeted, in-depth stock review of building codes\nand standards.\nThe Commission is seeking to identify the key areas where any review effort should be focussed, including for\nimproving regulator performance.\nFinancial regulation\nFinancial regulations are intended to ensure the financial integrity of the construction industry in Queensland,\nprotect consumers, and reduce the risk of insolvencies and disputes.\nStakeholders told the Commission that, despite financial regulations being in place, non-payment of contractors\nremains a significant issue. However, there were divergent views on what changes were needed, with some arguing\nregulations are costly and unnecessary and others arguing the framework needs to be strengthened.\nFinancial regulation specific to the construction industry relates to two matters.\nThe first of these are minimum financial requirements. In Queensland, building and construction contractor\nlicensees must demonstrate that they meet prescribed minimum financial requirements. The intent of this\nregulation is to prevent insolvencies by ensuring that contractors demonstrate ongoing financial sustainability to\nthe Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC) through annual financial reporting.\nNo other state or territory has similar requirements.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 29", "text_len": 4020, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Since their reinstatement in 2019 (reporting requirements were removed in 2014), Queensland\ninsolvencies have trended in line with those states without comparable reporting obligations.\nFurther, stakeholders tell us that annual financial reporting imposes a significant compliance cost on contractors.\nIn February 2025, the Queensland Government removed minimum financial reporting obligations for 97 per cent of\nall individual licensees.\nThere appears to be an in-principle case for removing all remaining minimum financial reporting requirements.\nHowever, the Commission is seeking further stakeholder views on the costs and benefits associated with the\nremaining financial reporting measures in effect and whether there is scope to remove or streamline these\nobligations further to reduce compliance costs.\nThe second financial regulation of the construction industry occurs through trust accounts.\nQueensland legislation prohibits head contractors from using retentions or project funds paid for subcontractor\nwork as part of their cash flow or on other projects. The scheme has progressively been rolled out, however an\nextension to private projects valued below $10 million has recently been paused.\nGiven that there has been no formal assessment of their impacts (and there appears to be a range of other\nmechanisms for resolving payment disputes under Queensland’s security of payment framework), trust account\nrequirements should remain paused until a full regulatory impact analysis has been conducted to ascertain\nwhether they are likely to deliver net benefits to the Queensland community.\nModern methods of construction\nIncreased use of modern methods of construction (MMC), including offsite fabrication, modular assembly and\nprefabrication, has the potential to increase productivity in the construction industry. Evidence suggests that MMC\nis used less widely in Australia than in other jurisdictions.\nWhile stakeholders have noted that MMC offers significant opportunities for increasing productivity, none were\nable to identify market failures that prevent more widespread use. Rather most stakeholders pointed to regulatory\nissues and procurement policies that impede or disincentivise MMC.\nFor this reason, there is no evidence to support more interventionist approaches, such as procurement mandates\nor direct subsidisation by government.\nEfforts to address regulatory barriers including those that prevent the achievement of scale (such as regulatory\ndifferences across jurisdictions), as well as efforts to ensure government procurement processes do not discourage\ninnovative approaches like MMC, appear most likely to address barriers to MMC and deliver net benefits to the\ncommunity.\nBeyond the preliminary recommendations relating to procurement and jurisdictional harmonisation of regulation,\nthe Commission suggests working through the revitalised National Competition Policy to address unnecessary\nregulatory barriers and ensure ‘regulatory neutrality’ between MMC and conventional construction methods in\nlocal planning schemes and consumer protections.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 30", "text_len": 3247, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

These include both rules around safe work practices, hazard identification and training, as well as\nassociated administrative and reporting requirements.\nStakeholder feedback suggests the implementation of WHS in the construction industry needs to be improved.\nWhile the Commission has not completed a full assessment, there is evidence to suggest that regulatory burdens\nhave increased in recent years:\n• Queensland businesses are reporting an increased compliance burden dealing with WHS regulation and\nregulators, with 38 per cent reporting a \"high burden\" compared to 27 per cent in 2017.\n• Since the development of national Model WHS Laws and the commencement of the Workplace Health and\nSafety Act 2011, there have been numerous changes made to WHS regulations in Queensland. While some of\nthese changes are because of national reviews of the Model WHS Laws, many have also been progressed\nunilaterally, resulting in a number Queensland-specific WHS provisions.\n• Stakeholders are reporting that WHS provisions available to parties (such as the ability to direct work on a site\nto cease) have been ‘weaponised’ and used as leverage on larger construction sites to achieve objectives other\nthan safety. This is consistent with the findings of the recently released Watson report, Violence in the\nQueensland CFMEU.

Since 2018, there has been no significant improvements in WHS outcomes,\nincluding the occurrence of workplace fatalities and serious incidents.\nWhile the Commission is seeking further feedback, stakeholders have suggested several reform options:\n• ensuring Queensland's WHS laws reflect the National Model Workplace Health and Safety Law\n• developing a single, harmonised incident reporting framework, with single point digital reporting\n• reviewing the powers and functions of the regulator so that it has a more effective and efficient role in\nfacilitating site safety, including provisions for the removal of any parties who are acting illegally\n• updating Workplace Health and Safety Queensland's compliance and enforcement policy\n• ensuring that WHS representatives are elected representatives of company workers with a cap of one per\nworking unit, elected representatives satisfy a fit and proper person tests for the position and options exist for\nsuspending WHS representatives where misconduct has been demonstrated or where the WHS representative\nno longer has the support of workers\n• reviewing right of entry provisions to ensure these are commensurate with risk\n• developing codes of practice that outline right of entry, agreed approaches to wet and hot weather events,\nappropriate responses to safety incidents, and how and when site shutdowns occur\n• ensuring WHS regulators are appropriately funded, resourced and supported to undertake their designated\nfunctions\n• convene quarterly forums as part of a recommended taskforce, between principal contractors, subcontractor\ngroups, industry associations and unions, to review stoppage data, resolve recurring issues and update\nguidelines as needed.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 31", "text_len": 3695, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Common themes from stakeholder submissions are that\nthe QBCC needs to:\n• be more efficient and remove duplicative and unclear processes\n• respond faster to resolve issues\n• be more transparent, consistent and effective in its enforcement of licensing and technical standards\n• have a greater focus on genuine instances of non-compliance and unlicensed operators, rather than minor\nissues\n• increase its presence and inspection activity in regional areas.\nThese views are broadly consistent with previous considerations of QBCC performance.4\nThe Commission understands the QBCC has recently commenced a process to improve regulator performance,\nwhich includes a new leadership tasked with an improved focus on consumers and a more accountable,\ntransparent, risk-based, and outcomes-driven regulatory approach (with a customer improvement plan and moves\nto establish an online licensing tool).\nAs noted by stakeholders, it is too early to assess whether these changes will address performance issues. Beyond\nthis, a key issue is whether the regulatory framework QBCC operates under provides the right incentives to\neffectively and efficiently deliver its activities.\nThe QBCC currently reports quarterly against a range of measures including processing times for renewals, licence\napplications and defects, movement to online forms and proportion of QBCC decisions set aside by the\nQueensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal. A review of these performance metrics should be undertaken to\nensure they complement the abovementioned reforms.\nThe Commission would like to understand whether any elements of the regulatory framework QBCC operates\nunder impedes performance. The Commission would also like to understand if the current metrics reported against\nappropriately measure QBCC's performance, and if not, what alternative metrics would help to make performance\noutcomes more transparent.\n4 Such as a recent 2023 Business Chamber Queensland report, which found 58 per cent of respondents in the construction\nindustry considered the QBCC to impose a high regulatory burden, and the 2022 QBCC Governance review, which is yet to be\nfully implemented.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 32", "text_len": 2434, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

In this context, general labour shortages are outside the scope of this inquiry except where\nthey affect productivity. Labour market issues are relevant to this inquiry where:\n• shortages of labour are concentrated in one area preventing the sequencing of works\n• regulations prevent the efficient allocation of labour (that is, to where it is most needed) or slow innovation by\nrestricting competition or being unnecessarily prescriptive about how work must be performed\n• Training frameworks and policies do not deliver the right skills to meet industry and community needs, are\nexcessively costly or have high non-completion rates.\nApprenticeships and training\nApprenticeships, combining on-the-job work experience with off-the-job training, are a key training pathway for\nthe construction industry.\nOn the surface, the apprentice pathway appears to be performing satisfactorily. As of September 2024, there were\napproximately 50 per cent more construction apprentices in-training in Queensland compared to four years prior.\nWith some exceptions in particular trades, the share of apprentices in Queensland as a proportion of the total\nworkforce is either close to or above the national average. According to National Centre for Vocational Education\nResearch surveys, there are high levels of satisfaction of employers and workers with the apprenticeship and\nvocational education systems.\nHowever, given the escalating demand for construction work, more will be required of the apprenticeship pathway\nif growing labour shortages are not to become an increasing drag on construction productivity.\nIssues raised by stakeholders focus on three key areas:\n• Information barriers facing apprentices, and the opportunities to attract and retain apprentices in the system,\nincluding the use of pre-apprenticeship and mentoring programs. This also applies to other supporting\ndisciplines in the construction industry, such as building certifiers.\n• Limitations in the capacity of the training system, especially for some trades and in some regional areas, in some\ncases, only very limited competition among service providers. Stakeholders indicated better use could be made\nof the existing capacity of Registered Training Organisations and education facilities, and greater use of Group\nTraining Organisations and technology.\n• Financial barriers facing employers, apprentices and students that restrict their ability to participate in the\ntraining system. This includes the higher costs facing employers and students in regional areas to access training\nand continue to work while training.\nThese are complex issues that have implications beyond the construction industry and require collaboration\nbetween industry and relevant government organisations and agencies to identify problems, reform opportunities\nand priorities. The Commission is seeking stakeholder views and evidence to provide guidance on the issues and\nreform options that this collaborative process could consider.\nOccupational licensing\nOccupational licensing and accreditation requirements are intended to ensure that work is completed safely, and\nwith appropriate care and skill. It provides benefits by allowing consumers and others to assess competency and\nhelp ensure that workers have the necessary skills and are accountable for the work they do.\nHowever, occupational licencing can impose significant costs, and in Australia the stringency of occupational entry\nregulation has been linked to lower rates of business entry and exit, a slower flow of workers from low to high\nproductivity firms, and skill shortages. Further, because they are regulated at the state level, occupational licensing\ncan restrict the flow of workers across state borders.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 33", "text_len": 3935, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 36, "text": "Summary\nWhile there are likely to be large potential gains from occupational licensing reform, specific licensing\nrequirements are often complex and technical in nature. Reforms may also have significant impacts on many\nstakeholders, and 'getting it wrong' could lead to health and safety risks for workers and consumers.\nGiven the risks, the Commission's preliminary recommendation is that a coordinated stock review of licensing\nrequirements should be conducted in accordance with best practice regulation principles. These reviews should\nidentify where there would be net benefits to the community in reducing these requirements, including the\nopportunity to more fully recognise prior learning and experience in assessing whether licensing requirements\nhave been met.\nIt is also the Commission's preliminary recommendation that any pending changes to occupational licensing, which\nhave the potential to increase requirements for the construction industry and have not been subject to an\nassessment under Queensland's Better Regulation Policy, should be suspended until that analysis is completed.\nImproving labour mobility\nAttracting skilled workers from other jurisdictions will be important for Queensland.\nWhere licensing is justified, it should not impede the movement of workers between jurisdictions. Allowing the free\nflow of workers between jurisdictions enables scarce labour resources to be used where they are most needed and\nallows firms to operate across borders, encouraging scale, innovation and knowledge sharing.\nSome possible options the Queensland Government could pursue to improve labour mobility include:\n• Participating in efforts to improve harmonisation — while there can be benefits from harmonisation,\nQueensland should participate only where the licensing requirements are necessary, effective and impose the\nminimum costs necessary to achieve the policy objective.\n• Improving the recognition of interstate licenses — Queensland is the only state that does not participate in\nautomatic mutual recognition. In contrast, NSW recognises a variety of interstate building licences including\nbricklayers, carpenters, plasterers, fencers, glaziers, joiners, painters, tilers, and stonemasons, allowing\ntradespeople licensed in other states to work there without additional fees and minimal requirements.\nSkilled overseas migration\nQueensland could recruit skilled construction workers from overseas to a greater extent. Migrants are under-\nrepresented in the construction industry and some stakeholder groups note that many skilled migrants remain\nunderemployed.\nWhile migration is primarily a matter for the Australian Government, there are two channels through which the\nQueensland Government could help leverage skills of international workers.\nFirst, there may be scope for the Queensland Government to advocate and nominate for an increased allocation of\nskilled international workers under the skilled nominated regional visas. This appears to be an under-utilised\npathway, with Queensland having only 1,200 out of the 26,260 total 2024-25 state and local government\nallocation, and with only around 100 construction trades workers migrating to Queensland each year under these\nvisa categories.\nSecondly, the Queensland Government could reduce duplicative or unnecessary barriers to skilled migration.\nStakeholder feedback suggests that skills recognition processes in Queensland could sometimes be quicker,\nsimpler and more cost effective. For example, a migrating electrician needs to have their skills recognised through\nthe Offshore Skills Assessment Program or a Temporary Skill Shortage Skills Assessment and then undertake\n12 months of supervised work under a licensed electrician before being able to apply for a Certificate III.\nWhile there is a mutual recognition process for New Zealand migrants in Queensland (and other states), there may\nbe opportunities to introduce mutual recognition with other developed countries, though this may require\nstronger links between domestic and international licensing bodies.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 34", "text_len": 4093, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The primary aim of the scheme is to protect workers from\nexploitation by labour hire service providers.\nLabour hire can provide an important mechanism for construction firms to efficiently manage their workforce in\nresponse to variable or unplanned demand and can provide benefits to workers by allowing them to obtain work\nmore easily, gain skills or experience, undertake flexible or varied work, or 'try out' new occupations.\nGiven the benefits of labour hire and the inherent costs of licensing regulation, including its potential to be used as\na tool to achieve other industrial outcomes (such as the protection of higher wages and conditions through the\nrestriction of competition), further evidence is required to demonstrate why labour hire regulation should remain.\nThere is a stronger rationale for protections for those occupations with low employee representation and low\nbargaining ability. However, it is not clear labour hire licensing is justified in the construction industry, given the\npotential for regulation to be misused, the high demand for construction workers (and corresponding higher\nbargaining powers), and the limited evidence provided to justify the introduction Labour Hire Licensing Act in 2017.\nOn balance, there appears to be an in-principle case to suggest labour hire licensing for construction work is less\nlikely to deliver a net community benefit than similar requirements in other industries. Given the potential risks\nassociated with reform and an apparent national harmonisation process, the Commission is seeking further\ninformation on the specific operation of labour hire licensing in the Queensland construction industry before\nforming a final recommendation.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 35", "text_len": 1935, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Foreign\ninvestment tends to encourage innovation because it provides a source for new and innovative building\napproaches, as well as increased competition.\nThe Queensland Government currently imposes two taxes on foreign investment in the housing market:\n• an additional 8 per cent (stamp) duty on transactions for foreign persons and corporations who are not\npermanent residents\n• a 3 per cent surcharge on land held by foreign companies or trusts, on taxable land values greater than or equal\nto $350,000.\nThe Australian Government charges additional tax obligations on the land holdings of foreign individuals and\nentities, including an annual vacancy fee for unoccupied dwellings.\nWhile foreign property holdings make up a small share of the total housing market, they are responsible for\nfunding just over 6 per cent of all new dwellings.\nAlthough surveys tend to show individuals have concerns about foreign investment in the housing market, studies\nshow that foreign investors are unlikely to make housing more unaffordable. Rather, foreign investors are likely to\nbe crucial to the development of new housing typologies, such as build to rent, and new construction methods. As\nsuch, additional taxes on foreign developers may discourage investment, reduce housing supply and reduce\ninnovation.\nThe Commission is seeking additional information on how taxes on foreign land holders affect the construction of\nhousing in Queensland, and whether recently announced reforms to streamline the provision of ex-gratia relief for\nfirms who contribute substantially to the housing stock will address stakeholder concerns.\nUtility connections\nFor many stakeholders, securing utility connections has become a key ‘pain point’ that is hampering the timely\ndelivery of residential and commercial construction projects and resulting in significant and unplanned additional\ncosts.\nStakeholders indicated that inconsistent application and interpretation of regulatory standards and requirements\nby Energy Queensland is leading to unforeseen and unnecessary delays and costs. For example, stakeholders\nargued that Energy Queensland's interpretation of wiring rules appears to be inconsistent with other distribution\nnetwork service providers in Australia. There appears to be a case for utilities to ensure their requirements align, as\nfar as practicable, with existing agreed standards.\nStakeholders also raised issues of delays and poor coordination between utility providers, developers, and local\ngovernments in the provision of infrastructure and connecting utilities. The Commission is seeking further\ninformation from stakeholders on the extent to which such coordination already occurs, and where there may be\nfurther opportunities to align development approval with timely infrastructure provision and utility connection.\nEnergy Queensland's enterprise bargaining agreement\nEnergy Queensland's (EQ) EBA (the Energy Queensland Union Collective Agreement 2024) requires that contractors\nand subcontractors carrying out contestable works on the EQ network, or on assets that will become part of the EQ\nnetwork, adhere to the same rates and conditions as provided in the agreement.\nSeveral stakeholders raised concerns about the EBA. For example, the Housing Industry Association claims that this\nmeans higher rates of pay and conditions will even apply to employees delivering non-electrical works, such as\nretaining walls and excavation trenches. As a result, they estimate that new housing allotments will be around\n$10,000 more expensive to deliver than they otherwise would be.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 36", "text_len": 3773, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For our initial consultation, we conducted more\nthan 50 stakeholder meetings with industry groups, trade unions, businesses and government. We also called for\nand received many submissions from stakeholders. These are available on our website.\nThe Commission would like to thank stakeholders for their involvement in the inquiry so far, and we look forward\nto further engagement on the matters raised in this interim report.\nIt is worth noting that many stakeholders were prepared to only provide confidential or verbal submissions to the\nCommission, stating a fear of reprisal (in the form of intimidation, loss of work, adverse treatment during approval\nor regulatory processes and/or procurement processes). It is not the role of the Commission to comment on the\naccuracy of these statements.

These\nare covered in the following four parts:\n• Part A: Government procurement — government procurement is having a large impact on construction\nindustry productivity both through the scale of its capital works program, which comprises a large and growing\nshare of construction industry activity, and the ways in which it procures these services. Key issues include Best\nPractice Industry Conditions (BPICs), general procurement rules and vetting and sequencing of capital projects.\n• Part B: Land use regulation — there is an emerging literature suggesting that restrictions on land use have\nbeen a significant contributor to declining productivity in the residential construction market. Given the close\nlinks to housing supply, reforms to land use regulation have the potential to generate large benefits for the\ncommunity. Land use regulation also has links to other economic activity, by regulating where and how these\nactivities occur.\n• Part C: Building regulation — developing and constructing housing and infrastructure in Australia requires\ncompliance with a growing body of regulation, imposed by every level of government. These regulatory burdens\nare likely to be hindering construction industry productivity and inhibiting innovation in the sector. Key focus\nareas include regulation of labour markets, workplace health and safety regulation and building regulation.\n• Part D: Labour markets — because construction activity is sequential, skilled labour shortages in one area can\nadversely impact productivity by delaying activities in other areas. Queensland's labour market is currently\nextremely tight, and there is rising demand for construction workers. Key settings that can exacerbate matters\ninclude labour market regulation such as licencing, training of new workers and policy settings around skilled\nmigration.\nThe Commission has also considered several other issues that have been raised by stakeholders, including taxation\nof foreign land holders, impacts arising from Energy Queensland enterprise bargaining agreements and utility\nconnections. These are covered in Part E: Other matters.\nThe report also contains several technical appendices that support the analysis in this interim report.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 60", "text_len": 2517, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Labour productivity today is only 5 per cent higher\nthan it was in 1994-95 — in comparison, labour productivity in the market economy grew by 65 per\ncent over the same period.\n• While there are difficulties in assessing more recent changes in productivity because of large structural\nchanges within the industry, the industry's productivity appears to have declined by around 9 per cent\nsince 2018.\n• If the Queensland construction industry’s productivity had been maintained at 2018 levels:\n– the industry would require 9 per cent less labour to achieve the same level of output — this would\nmore than offset recent industry estimates of worker shortfalls.\n– the industry may have been able to construct an additional 77,000 dwellings, with flow through\nbenefits for housing affordability.\n• Queensland’s construction industry is facing rising levels of demand, boosted by the infrastructure and\nhousing needed to support a growing population, and other key government infrastructure, including\nfor the 2023 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n• At the same time, the industry is facing difficult conditions with a tight labour market and supply chain\nissues making the operating environment extremely challenging.\n• As a result, the industry is increasingly unable to keep pace with demand:\n– The pipeline of work yet to be done has more than doubled since 2020, with infrastructure projects\nincreasingly behind time and over budget.\n– The housing market is not keeping pace with population changes, and housing affordability is\ndeclining.\n• If the construction industry is to meet the challenges ahead, productivity will need to increase.\n• The evidence suggests that low productivity is not unique to Queensland. In recent decades,\nconstruction productivity has mainly been flat across Australia and in many other developed countries.\nThere are exceptions and there have been periods in which construction productivity grew quickly,\nsuggesting the construction industry is not inherently unproductive, but has become less so.\n• Although international and national evidence on the causes of slow productivity growth is incomplete,\nit suggests that policy and regulation is likely to have played a key role through:\n– the introduction of more restrictive land use regulation that may have made it more difficult and\nexpensive to construct housing and other buildings\n– building regulation becoming more complex and burdensome\n– differences in regulation between jurisdictions (and the way they are structured) that create\nincentives to keep the industry fragmented and dominated by small firms\n– government policies and procurement practices that directly impact productivity and stifle cost and\nproductivity disciplines more broadly.\n• Improving productivity does not require a reduction in working conditions.

In recent decades, |  | \n |  | construction productivity has mainly been flat across Australia and in many other developed countries. |  | \n |  | There are exceptions and there have been periods in which construction productivity grew quickly, |  | \n |  | suggesting the construction industry is not inherently unproductive, but has become less so. |  | \n |  | • Although international and national evidence on the causes of slow productivity growth is incomplete, |  | \n |  | it suggests that policy and regulation is likely to have played a key role through: |  | \n |  | – the introduction of more restrictive land use regulation that may have made it more difficult and |  | \n |  | expensive to construct housing and other buildings |  | \n |  | – building regulation becoming more complex and burdensome |  | \n |  | – differences in regulation between jurisdictions (and the way they are structured) that create |  | \n |  | incentives to keep the industry fragmented and dominated by small firms |  | \n |  | – government policies and procurement practices that directly impact productivity and stifle cost and |  | \n |  | productivity disciplines more broadly. |  | \n |  | • Improving productivity does not require a reduction in working conditions.

Over the past several years,\ndemand for homes has outpaced the industry's capacity to provide new supply, with dwelling completions\ndeclining since 2016 (Figure 2.4), despite rising demand. This has led to significant declines in housing affordability,\nwith dwelling prices, rents and levels of homelessness escalating (for example, Pawson 2024).\nFigure 2.4 A significant uptick in completions is needed to meet housing targets\nQueensland dwelling completions\n55\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\nMar-92 Mar-96 Mar-00 Mar-04 Mar-08 Mar-12 Mar-16 Mar-20 Mar-24\nSource: QPC based on ABS 2025b.\nNote: Annual rolling sum.\nWithout significant change, Queensland is unlikely to build enough homes to address recent declines in\naffordability:\n• The Queensland Government is aiming to have an additional 1 million additional homes built over the next 20\nyears (Crisafulli 2024), that is, 50,000 homes per annum. However, over the last decade only 37,000 homes were\ndelivered per year, and in recent years, the number has been even lower (Figure 2.4).\n• The Urban Development Institute of Australia (2025) recently forecast that Queensland will undershoot its\nNational Housing Accord annual dwelling target by between 37 per cent and 43 per cent in each of the next five\nyears, with a combined 'supply gap' of roughly 74,000 dwellings (p. 26). The Property Council of Australia\n(2025b, p.11) also recently projected a shortfall of 96,000 homes in Queensland by 2029.\nOutside of housing, there are also signs that both private investment and public infrastructure projects are being\nimpacted by declining productivity in the construction industry.\nWhile there have been numerous cost overruns and delays to public projects, such as those on the Cross River Rail\nproject, there have also been similar issues on some private sector projects. For example, the project costs on the\nQueen's Wharf development have reportedly increased by $1 billion, from an original costing of $2.6 billion\n(Samios & Macdonald 2025).\nLooking ahead, stakeholders have raised concerns about how the construction industry is going to service future\ndemand, with concerns being raised about productivity on infrastructure sites and future workforce shortages\n(Master Builders Queensland 2025a; QMCA 2024). There is broad agreement there is not enough workers (directly\nand indirectly involved in the construction industry) to deliver the work in the pipeline.\nPersistent skills shortages across all specialist trades represent a major constraint on the industry's\ncapacity to deliver on Queensland’s significant infrastructure agenda and contribute to overall\neconomic growth.

Meanwhile, Construction Skills Queensland (2025b) predicts that Queensland is likely to face an average\nshortfall of around 18,000 construction workers per year over the next eight years.\n'Skills shortages' do not necessarily reflect market or regulatory failures.

Addressing this decline would not only address most of the current worker shortages in the\nconstruction industry, it would also allow improved outcomes for the rest of the economy.7\nEven modest improvements are likely to have large impacts. For example, if construction labour productivity had\nremained at 2018 levels, the industry could have produced 9 per cent more output with the same number of\nworkers. If this extra capacity had been funnelled into the housing market, Queensland could have delivered\naround 77,000 additional dwellings.\nIncreasing productivity will also increase the industry's sustainability through increased levels of industry\nprofitability. Construction has high insolvency rates, linked to high upfront costs, cash flows delays, scale of many\nbusinesses, vertical separation and cascading nature of payments. In the 2024 financial year, 297 construction\ncompanies collapsed, accounting for 23 per cent of all insolvencies, in Queensland (ASIC 2024). In the current\ncontext of high insolvency rates, improving the financial sustainability of construction businesses should reduce the\nexposure of home buyers, creditors, workers, and government to insolvency risks.\nHigher levels of productivity can also enable the industry to improve working conditions, by generating more\nincome. Whilst there has been significant policy effort over the last decade to improve safety in the construction\nindustry, outcomes in the industry remain broadly the same. For example, workplace health and safety data show\nthat since 2018 there have been no reductions in fatalities or serious injuries (discussed further in Chapter 15).\n7 Construction Skills Queensland's Horizon 2032 report forecasts an average shortfall of 18,200 workers over the period 2024–25\nto 2031–32.

Queensland\nconstruction estimates are modelled. Data for other countries are sourced from the OECD and use ‘Industry (except construction)’ as the\ncomparator. ** Data is not available for all countries for the full period, therefore it has been averaged over the period for which it is\navailable.\nAlthough construction industries across jurisdictions have generally experienced weak productivity growth, the\nextent of this trend has shown significant variation.\nFor example, while New Zealand has generally recorded softer productivity growth than Australia, productivity in\nNew Zealand’s construction industry has grown more quickly. Further, in direct contrast to Australia, New Zealand\nhas experienced strong productivity growth in building construction and weak growth in engineering construction\n(New Zealand Infrastructure Commission Te Waihanga 2022).\nSimilarly, there is significant intertemporal variation in productivity outcomes. International data suggest that low\nconstruction productivity is a relatively recent phenomenon, with construction in many countries experiencing\nperiods of high productivity growth (PC 2025a). For example, D'Amico et al (2023) suggest that construction\nproductivity in the US grew quickly until the 1970s. Similarly, the PC (2025a) show that construction productivity in\nAustralia grew faster than the economy average during the 1970s.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 73\ntnec\nrep\ndnalsneeuQ ailartsuA dnalaeZ\nweN\nmodgniK\ndetinU\nadanaC ecnarF ynamreG muigleB dnalreztiwS\nConstruction Other industries*", "text_len": 2554, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The Australian Productivity Commission\nsimilarly concluded that mismeasurement could not explain weak productivity performance in Australia's\nresidential building industry (PC 2025a).\n• Boom and bust cycles — while some stakeholders have argued that boom-bust cycles reduce productivity (for\nexample, HIA 2024b), New Zealand’s Infrastructure Commission (2022) undertook a cross country examination\nand found no statistically significant relationship between volatility in construction growth and productivity\noutcomes.\n• A lack of general competition — the Australian construction market appears to be competitive, being both\nunconcentrated (Bakhtiari 2020) and associated with low markups (Hambur 2021). Even among the\nconcentrated subsection of the industry that delivers public infrastructure, the Australian Productivity\nCommission (2014) did not find any ‘concrete evidence’ that a lack of competition had substantially inflated\ncosts.8\n• Changes in the composition of labour inputs — some researchers (e.g. Goodrum et al. 2002) have identified that\nworkers performing specific tasks (e.g. framing or trenching) have become more productive despite flat\nproductivity outcomes across the industry. One suggestion is that growth in 'white-collar’ workers as a share of\nemployees — as observed in Australia and the UK — might reflect increased project complexity, or a response\nto more complex regulatory environments (ONS 2021; RLB 2024). However, in Australia those changes have\nprimarily occurred in civil and engineering construction, which has experienced comparably strong productivity\ngrowth, rather than in building construction. The Australian Productivity Commission found that growth in white\ncollar employment does not explain the decline the housing construction productivity (PC 2025a, p. 41).\nPossible causes – international and national evidence\nIndustry fragmentation and sequential nature of construction may reduce innovation\nIt is possible that the nature of the construction industry makes it resistant to innovation, which in turn makes it\ndifficult to achieve significant productivity improvements.\nThe construction industry tends to be fragmented, in that there is little vertical integration with individual firms\neach performing separate tasks in the supply chain. For example, houses are typically built by a series of specialist\ntradespeople that usually operate as separate entities, such as carpenters, plumbers and electricians. This may\nprevent the industry from achieving productivity gains through consolidation, streamlining of operations and\nachieving better control over the construction process.\nWhile unconcentrated markets are typically more competitive, industry fragmentation — wherein a project is\ndivided into discrete tasks undertaken by small businesses and subcontractors — may lead to coordination\nproblems that inhibit the uptake of new technology and practices.\nThe Australian Constructors Association (2023, p. 9) has argued that the standard commercial environment, in\nwhich small (and even large) construction firms operate on thin margins with limited current assets, drives ‘a\nmyopic focus on short-term survival’ over long-term innovation or investment.\n8 Importantly, governments also have market power as monopsonistic infrastructure purchasers.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 74", "text_len": 4001, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Regulation often imposes a fixed administrative cost on businesses irrespective of size. This represents a\nlarger relative cost for smaller businesses and may create drag on aggregate productivity.\nThe sequential nature of construction may also reduce incentives for firms to innovate. As construction tasks are\nsequential and dependent on each other, disruptions at any stage of the construction process can lead to\ncascading delays and large holding costs. Because new technologies may increase the risk of delays, firms need to\nhave a significant level of confidence in the return they will generate to justify their use. That means in the\nconstruction industry, unlike other industries where processes are tightly controlled, new technologies can face\nhurdles larger than the direct cost of their adoption.\nThis is reflected in survey data showing that construction firms tend to be smaller than those in other industries,\nand less innovative than similar sized firms in other industries (Figure 2.14).\nFigure 2.14 Construction is dominated by small firms that do not innovate\nShare of businesses by employees and innovation status, Australia, 2022–23\nConstruction\nOther industries\n0 25 50 75 100\nshare of businesses (per cent)\ninnovation active, 0–4 employees innovation active, 5–19 employees innovation active, 20+ employees\nnot innovation active, 0–4 employees not innovation active, 5–19 employees not innovation active, 20+ employees\nSource: QPC based on ABS 2024g.\nIncreased regulatory burden appears to be a contributing factor\nWhile these issues, at least partially, reflect the nature of the industry, they may have been exacerbated by\nregulation. The Australian Productivity Commission's recent review of housing construction productivity (2025a)\nfound that regulation tends to hinder the growth of construction firms by:\n• Making it hard to replicate processes across the country due to geographical regulatory differences\n• Requiring builders to obtain regulatory approval and demonstrate compliance for each new project, due to\nbuilding regulations tending to be project-based rather than firm-based.\n• Encouraging risk management approaches that lead to highly disaggregated specialisation and outsourcing.\nRecent research by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (2025) also suggests that policy and\nregulatory settings are keeping builders small due to:\n• Tax incentives, including instant asset write-offs and payroll tax thresholds, which favour smaller firms\n• Australia's complex and decentralised system of land-use regulation, which exacerbates geographical\nsegmentation, making it hard for firms to expand into new areas\n• Complex state-based occupational licensing rules, which make it harder for productive businesses to expand\ninterstate.\nThe quality, availability, and use of land, including the regulation of land use\nA possible explanation of slowing productivity growth over the long run is that development opportunities have\nbecome scarcer and more challenging as populations grow and urban centres densify.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 75\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ", "text_len": 3405, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Some researchers argue that a key driver of this\ndecline is land use regulations that work to restrict the size of housing developments, disincentivise larger firms\nand reduce incentives to invest in innovation. They argue that construction productivity in the US only began to fall\nwith the growth in land use regulations during the 1970s.\nThe view that land use regulation is hindering productivity is supported by McKinsey Global Institute (2017, p. 45)\nwho state that:\nAssembling land is another problematic area where regulation hinders productivity. A patchwork\nof outdated zoning codes, fragmented land ownership, and extensive review processes makes it\nvery difficult for developers to assemble land quickly and build on a large scale, and therefore\nlimits their ability to standardize and modularize construction designs.\nThis view was also supported by stakeholders during initial consultation. For example:\nCouncil policies on height limits, lot minimums and character protections in residential zoning all\nseverely limit the developable land to a handful of large sites, particularly in the inner city where\ntransport access is barely relevant for access to employment. (Greater Brisbane, sub. 11, p. 2).\nCross-country analysis by New Zealand’s Infrastructure Commission (2022) also suggests that countries with more\ncumbersome construction permit processes tend to experience slower construction productivity growth.\nWhile there are significant empirical issues that make it difficult to demonstrate causation, there have been several\ninstances where increases in building productivity have followed the relaxation of land use regulation. For example:\n• New Zealand’s building sector experienced strong productivity growth after reforms to relax zoning and other\nland-use restrictions were introduced during mid-2010 (Maltman 2024).\n• Australian Productivity Commission (2025a) research suggests that productivity in Australia’s high-density\nresidential construction sector grew strongly over the period 2010 to 2016. This period followed the relaxation\nof planning rules, which placed greater emphasis on streamlined planning processes, particularly in Brisbane,\nMelbourne and Sydney (Shoory 2016).\n• Research on significant reforms in Sao Paulo found that construction output increased both in areas where\ndevelopment rights had increased, as well as overall across the city (Anagol et al. 2021).\n• US studies (for example Burn-Murdoch 2024) have also associated land use regulation reform with increased\nconstruction of housing.\nRegulation of construction practices, outputs and workforce\nIn Australia, construction activity requires compliance with layers of regulation imposed by every level of\ngovernment. For example, building regulations dictate:\n• where housing can be built, how it should be built and what it should look like\n• who can undertake construction activity and under what conditions licences can be held\n• conditions for complying with standards relating to health and safety, environmental and natural hazard\nmanagement (PC 2025a).\nWhile regulations can provide significant benefits to the community (for example by providing assurance of\nquality) and can even enhance productivity (where they, for example, reduce search costs for consumers and\nemployers) they can also impose significant drags on productivity, particularly where they are unnecessarily\nprescriptive, outdated or complex.\nThere is some evidence that regulatory burdens are increasing (for example see PC 2025a), and industry groups\n(HIA 2024b; Master Builders Australia 2024a) argue that building regulation is substantially increasing the costs and\ncomplexity of building and that regulatory barriers are inhibiting the adoption of productivity improving\ntechnologies.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 76", "text_len": 3995, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

First introduced in 2018, BPICs initially applied to only parts of the Townsville Stadium project.\nOver time, the scope expanded to include Queensland Government construction projects valued at $100 million or\nmore and on ‘declared’ projects.\nStakeholders from across the industry have told us that, since their introduction, BPICs have caused a significant\nslowdown in site productivity on public construction sites and have enabled productivity weakening conditions to\ncreep into the private sector through the roll-out of BPIC-like conditions in enterprise bargaining agreements\n(EBAs).\nBPIC has reduced the attractiveness of Queensland to contractors as it has resulted in delivery\ncosts being substantially higher than other jurisdictions...

However,\nthese costs need to be considered against the benefits that regulation creates.\nThe building and construction industry is subject to a wide range of regulations, codes and standards (Figure 3.1).\nLike other regulation, these generally seek to support the efficient functioning of markets and improve outcomes\nfor the community.\nFigure 3.1 Key regulations affecting construction in Queensland\nSource: QPC.\nNote: The above chart is indicative only and does not exhaustively list all legislations that could potentially apply to the construction\nindustry, including subordinate instruments. Some legislation may also apply across more than one regulatory category.\nRegulations affecting the construction industry typically aim to improve worker and public safety, protect\nconsumers from poor quality products, and minimise environmental impacts. Where regulations have a strong\nrationale and are designed and administered well to address the underlying problem, the benefits should outweigh\nany costs that arise.\nThe total cost of all regulation in Queensland is large. According to Business Chamber Queensland’s Efficient\nRegulation Report 2023, the costs of federal, state and local regulation could be as high as $11 billion annually, with\na median annual cost of $50,000 per Queensland business11. Reports from the Australian Productivity Commission\n(2011b), Queensland’s Better Regulation Taskforce (2017), and business groups such as Business Chamber\nQueensland (2023) have all identified broad challenges for business from regulation, including an increase in\ncomplexity and duplication, difficulties in identifying and understanding regulatory obligations and a growing\ncumulative burden.

Many regulations also\nappear to specifically apply to or disproportionately impact the building and construction industry— however, as\ndetailed in later sections, in some circumstances there appears to be limited evidence for why the building and\nconstruction industry is sufficiently different from other industries to warrant additional regulation.14\nEven when regulations, considered in isolation, do not appear overly burdensome, the accumulation and\ncombination of different regulation may still lead to market or government failures (Mandel & Carew 2013). For\nexample, multiple regulations can interact in ways that are either obvious or not, leading to duplication and\nincreased costs for businesses.\nIn addition, a large accumulation of regulations can create high barriers to entry, potentially discouraging new\nmarket entrants and allow existing businesses to accumulate excessive market power. This can disproportionately\naffect smaller businesses, as many experience higher costs of regulation (as a proportion of its total costs and\nturnover) than larger businesses and often have fewer resources to understand and fulfil compliance obligations\n(OECD 1997; PC 2013).15\nRegulatory uncertainty and policy unpredictability is an issue most cited in investor surveys and can have a\nsignificant effect on investor confidence and productivity (ASBFEO 2017; OECD 2015). As noted by Davis (2019, p.\n13):\n… a variety of studies find evidence that high (policy) uncertainty undermines economic\nperformance by leading firms to delay or forego investments and hiring, by slowing productivity-\nenhancing factor reallocation, and by depressing consumption expenditures.’\nIdentifying opportunities for improvement can be challenging\nThe ever-increasing volume of regulation, across multiple levels of government, can make it difficult for those\naffected by regulation to identify and prioritise specific opportunities for improving regulation (QPC 2021).\nSimilarly, it can be difficult to assess the impact of an individual regulation, including whether it is performing as\nintended, because of the way it interacts with other legislation or because impacts are not felt until long after its\nintroduction. For example, while individual regulations may, on their own, represent a low regulatory burden, the\ncumulative burden of these regulations on an industry may be significant (NZPC 2014; OECD 2008).\n12 Business Chamber Queensland’s survey received 329 responses from Queensland businesses across all sectors including\nconstruction.\n13 Geck and Mackay (2018) noted that “the Victorian Competition and Efficiency Commission's (VCEC) 2005 survey of 20 building\npractitioners indicated that the costs of regulatory compliance added between 2 and 20 per cent to the cost of a new home in\nVictoria. This compared with other estimates at the time that suggested regulation added between 5 per cent and 11 per cent to\ncost.”\n14 In general, specific regulation is justified where there is evidence of an industry specific market failure that is not addressed\nthrough general 'economy-wide' regulation.\n15 As earlier noted, the construction industry has a large share of small firms.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 82", "text_len": 4098, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For example, regulators taking\nan excessively rigid approach to enforcing the intent of regulation, can impose unnecessary administrative burdens\non regulated entities and negatively impact innovation and efficiency (Australian Government 2006).\nOpportunities for reform are likely to arise in both:\n• reviewing existing regulation (including sunset and stock reviews), to detect those requirements that no longer\nprovide a net public benefit and those that may no longer be fit for purpose due to, for example, changes in\ntechnology, consumer preferences and industry and market conditions.\n• improvements in the administration (and enforcement) of regulation by regulators.\nGovernments can also improve the overarching regulatory environment by directly promoting better processes\nand behaviours that support regulatory reform and improved regulatory outcomes. While it is acknowledged by\nindustry and the community that regulations will ‘evolve over time,’ regulatory risk can be mitigated by\ngovernments providing greater certainty, when policy changes or reforms are undertaken, through transparency\nand consultation (European Investment Bank 2016; OECD 2015). This includes:\n• providing transparency of analysis and decisions and undertaking consultation (for example, using RIA to\ncommunicate to both decision makers and the public the costs and benefits of proposed regulations)\n• having appropriate implementation timeframes for new or amended regulations.\nManaging the stock of regulation\nOne of the few strategies that has shown to be effective in improving the quality of regulation is the evaluation of\nthe ‘stock’ of regulation that has accumulated over time, to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness (QPC\n2021). Evaluation can effectively target the key issue—regulatory design—and provide a robust assessment of\nwhether a regulation supports the public interest or not.\nManagement of the stock of regulation involves more than arbitrarily ‘cutting red tape.’ Rather, it means:\nretaining ‘good’ regulation, while removing or amending regulation that is no longer fit for purpose\n(PC 2011b, p. 18).\nThere are various approaches to managing the stock of regulation, ranging from routine activities to more major\nundertakings:\n• sunset reviews can evaluate expiring regulation against changes in technology, market conditions, consumer\npreferences and behaviours, community expectations and regulator best practice. They can assist in reducing\nduplication, regulatory burden and determining whether regulatory provisions are still required at all.\n• evidence suggests there is greater value in more targeted, in-depth reviews of packages of regulations or\nregulation within industry sectors that potentially give rise to excessive regulatory burdens (Greiner et al. 2017;\nPC 2011b).\nThese approaches can be informed by an appropriate framework for assessing regulations (see Table 3.1).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 83", "text_len": 3053, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

A singular focus on value for money, however, is likely to mitigate some of\nthis risk, by providing grounds for a more objective assessment.\nAssessing projects based on a singular value for money focus does not, however, mean that social and\nenvironmental objectives will not be considered by government, as these are typically either inherent in the\npurchasing decision (that is, infrastructure being built to deliver a social objective) or covered by other regulation.\nCommercial arrangements are likely to deliver highest value for money outcomes\nCosts are likely to be lowest where the government procures construction services on a commercial arrangement\nbasis (that is, reflective of existing market and regulatory conditions).\nWhere procurement processes move away from commercial arrangements, for example because they are\nunnecessarily prescriptive or contain provisions that are unrelated to maximising a project's value, they are not\nonly likely to increase project costs, but undermine construction industry productivity, with subsequent impacts on\nthe broader community.\nProcurement rules are likely to impose additional costs and impede construction industry productivity where they:\n• distort the contracted firms’ employment and subcontracting decisions through quotas or hiring restrictions\n(Nechvoglod et al. 2009)\n• include requirements for contractors to adhere to above industry-standard or legislated labour and/or\nenvironmental conditions (PC 2014)\n• restrict competition, such as through requirements for contractors to gain pre-approval to tender for projects, or\nwhere procurement processes explicitly or implicitly restrict tenderers (including where excessively complex\ntendering processes restricts the ability of SMEs to participate) (Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise\nOmbudsman 2023; Klok Advisory 2025)\n• increase input costs through local content rules, or other restrictive sourcing requirements (Deringer et al. 2018)\n• include specifications that move beyond those required to describe the outcomes the infrastructure is required\nto deliver, such that they restrict room for innovative or lower cost solutions by the supplier (PC 2014)\n• unnecessarily increase complexity for project managers (PC 2014).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 90", "text_len": 4296, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This includes ensuring that prior to\nundertaking any procurement, context and agency specific controls are embedded throughout the entire\nprocurement process (Independent Commission Against Corruption New South Wales 2024).\nTransparency can also be improved by including mechanisms that strengthen incentives for decision makers to\nselect projects based on their net benefits. For example, requiring cost benefit analyses (with a complete options\nanalysis) to be undertaken and published, allows assumptions and estimates to be transparently tested. This is also\nlikely to improve the quality of analyses as any flaws are likely to be identified (PC 2014).\nTransparent decision-making processes are vital for ensuring projects are selected based on their net benefits to\nthe community. In the absence of transparent and robust information and analysis, there are few incentives for\ngood decision making, since it is difficult for third parties to assess the merits of selected projects.\nWhen projects are announced in the absence of robust analysis and planning, evidence suggests these projects are\nmore likely to experience cost overruns (Terrill 2016; Terrill et al. 2020).\nGovernments should be cognisant of their impact on the broader market\nWhen procuring larger infrastructure projects, governments should be cognisant of how the project will impact the\nmarket. This should include an assessment of the state of the market and how the broader capital program is likely\nto affect market capacity.\nThis should be a continuous process given the propensity for delays between the decision to go to market and the\nselection of a tenderer.\nWhere governments aim to deliver large infrastructure projects in overheated construction markets, they are likely\nto cause rapid increases in construction prices and undermine industry productivity. This can occur where excessive\ndemand creates labour or materials shortages, that in turn, reduces the ability of the market to sequence tasks\nefficiently.\nTypically, best practice approaches try and minimise impacts by sequencing projects based on their expected net\nbenefit to the community. Formally assessing projects against their expected net benefits can also discourage the\ninclusion of unnecessary features since proponents need to minimise costs to push projects “up the line”.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 91", "text_len": 4020, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Evidence suggests that poor project selection and sequencing is\nlikely to be contributing to this increased growth.\nProject selection\nThere currently appears to be a relatively low level of transparency around how the Queensland Government\nselects projects. That is, only a handful of recent Queensland Government-funded infrastructure projects appear to\nhave a publicly disclosed assessment including a cost benefit analysis (CBA)17.\nSimilarly, project announcements do not appear to be contingent on robust analysis being completed. Early\nannouncements that include untested cost and schedule estimates may place undue pressure on delivery and\nprocuring agencies to meet unrealistic expectations, leading to poor planning decisions (Staples 2025). This\nsentiment was reinforced by stakeholders:\nAnnouncing project budgets and timeframes before sufficient planning and investigation has been\nundertaken places unnecessary pressure on government delivery agencies as well as the\nconstruction industry. It sets an expectation within the community of what a project will cost\ntaxpayers that will forever be the benchmark against which project success is measured.\n(Australian Constructors Association, sub. 39, p. 12)\nFurther, stakeholders told the Commission that many projects proceed past the business case stage based on\noverstated benefits (Queensland Major Contractors Association, sub. 66, p. 20). Additionally, projects tend to\ninclude overly elaborate or unnecessary features that add costs without improving functionality (Advantage Project\nSolutions, sub. 69, p. 4).\nThese shortcomings are not unique to Queensland and are a common problem across Australian governments (PC\n2014, pp. 75–107).\nA high-level evaluation of a selection of recent projects was undertaken to assess whether Queensland\nGovernment project selection processes are robust. This assessment considered whether:\n• a robust assessment had been used during project selection\n• the business case was based on overly optimistic assumptions\n• where the business case did not pass a CBA but the project was progressed anyway\n• a higher cost option was selected over a lower cost alternative likely to deliver similar outcomes.\nBased on these criteria the Commission was able to identity several recent projects that demonstrate poor project\nselection.\nCross River Rail\nInfrastructure Australia (2017) identified \"material concerns\" with the business case used by the Queensland\nGovernment to justify the Cross River Rail project. These concerns included the estimated project benefits being\n\"significantly overstated\" such that it was unlikely that the project would deliver a net benefit as stated (the\nbusiness case estimated the project as having a benefit-cost ratio of 1.41, meaning benefits would exceed the\ncosts).\n17 Project assessments should however be appropriate for the stage of the project, noting that these assessments take time and\nare often costly.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 93", "text_len": 3231, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Even accounting for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, patronage growth\naveraged only 2.6 per cent for the three years leading up to 2018-19. Infrastructure Australia (2017) similarly noted\nin its evaluation of the business case, that \"this [6.9 per cent] is a rate of growth not previously seen in Australia\nover such a sustained period”.\nDespite these concerns, and Infrastructure Australia's (2017) decision to not include the project on its Infrastructure\nPriority List (which is one of several inputs considered by the Australian Government when making investment\ndecisions), the Queensland Government progressed the project at an anticipated cost of $5.4 billion.\nGiven these concerns were raised when the anticipated cost was $5.4 billion, expected cost overruns and\ncompletion delays (for example, O’Neal 2023 and Queensland Government 2024h) — whether unforeseeable or a\nconsequence of poor project planning — have significantly reduced the likelihood the project will deliver a net\nbenefit to the community.\nYouth Detention Centre at Woodford\nAn 80-bed youth detention centre in Woodford is estimated to cost $983 million (Queensland Parliament 2024) —\nequating to approximately $12 million per bed. When compared to per-bed cost estimates of other recent youth\ndetention centre projects, the Woodford Youth Detention Centre appears significantly more costly.\nFor example, the 32-bed West Moreton Youth Detention Centre at Wacol cost $150 million — equating to\napproximately $5 million per bed, while a 16-bed extension at the existing Brisbane Youth Detention Centre cost\n$27 million — equating to approximately $2 million per bed (Farmer 2020).\nWhile acknowledging potential differences in project size, location, and service delivery requirements, based on\npublicly available information, the driver(s) of this significant cost disparity appears unclear.\nCairns Marine Precinct Common User Facility\nIn 2022, the Australian and Queensland governments jointly committed $387 million towards the delivery of a\nmaritime Common User Facility (CUF) at the Cairns Marine Precinct (CMP) to allow the precinct to capitalise on\nfuture defence and maritime industry business. Based on publicly available information it is unclear if the CUF\npassed its initial CBA.\nIn late 2024, following the transfer of the ownership and delivery of the project to Ports North, a review of the CBA\nidentified several assumptions and estimates to be inconsistent with the requirements of the project. The project\ncost estimate was revised to $826 million (113 per cent higher than the original cost estimate).\nAt the time of writing, Ports North was preparing a business case optimisation report to “recommend the scope\nand additional funding required to support the construction of a commercially viable CUF that meets industry\nneeds (Advance Cairns 2025)”.\nQueensland Rail Station Upgrade Program\nWhile the Commission has not made a full assessment, Queensland Rail's $1.5 billion investment on train station\nupgrades, delivered under the Station Accessibility Upgrade Program, appears to have delivered upgrades\nexceeding those likely to be required to improve accessibility and safety outcomes.\nFor example, it appears that Queensland Rail undertook full station rebuilds, which required those stations to be\nclosed for extended periods of time — in some instances for more than a year — without fully considering lower\ncost options that may have achieved similar (or better) outcomes with less disruption.\nSimilarly, a combined $181.8 million (Queensland Government 2024a, p. 111) was spent upgrading Lindum,\nBundamba, and Banyo stations, despite each of these stations being surrounded by low density housing, an\nindustrial estate, and in the case of the former two, a floodplain.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 94", "text_len": 3988, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This resulted in site specific environmental and other approvals being\nomitted from project plans, and projects being developed without appropriately accommodating differences\nbetween rural, regional and metropolitan hospital needs and requirements.\nThe Sangster Review estimates that the CEP originally budgeted to cost $9.8 billion is now expected to cost $17\nbillion, with delays of between six months and three years estimated for 13 of the 15 projects. The Sangster Review\nidentifies these cost blowouts and project delays to be largely attributable to poor planning and decision making\nprocesses (Klok Advisory 2025).\nThe Commission would like to test our project assessments with stakeholders to determine if poor project\nselection is a pervasive issue, and identify examples of best practice.\nProject sequencing\nWhile it is not uncommon for project planning to be fragmented across government departments, or even across\nvarious divisions within a single department, fragmentation can be problematic where it reduces government's\nability to sequence its capital pipeline, and can result in government demand overheating the market (International\nMonetary Fund 2025).\nStakeholders raised concerns about the extent to which the Queensland Government's capital program may be\nimpacting the construction industry's ability to deliver the:\n• housing supply required to improve housing affordability in Queensland\n• essential infrastructure required to meet the needs of Queensland's growing population on-time and on-budget\n(see Master Builders Queensland CEO Paul Bidwell, as quoted in McKenna 2025; CSQ 2025b; Games\nIndependent Infrastructure Coordination Authority 2025).\nThe Sangster Review (Klok Advisory 2025, p. 36) found evidence to suggest that poor project sequencing may also\nbe resulting in intra-departmental projects competing with one another for resources. For example, it was noted\nthat despite Health Infrastructure Queensland19 (HIQ) engaging an infrastructure advisory body to undertake\nmarket sounding prior to launching the CEP procurement process — which identified significant market capacity\nconstraints and issues and recommended the use of a staged procurement process — HIQ progressed with the\nsimultaneous procurement of all 15 projects.\n18 The Review also states that a full business case has still yet to be undertaken on the Queensland Cancer Centre.\n19 The division of Queensland Health responsible for leading the planning, design, procurement and delivery of Queensland’s\ncapital infrastructure.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 95", "text_len": 3663, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

By paying higher prices\nto direct large volumes of resources towards 'priority' projects, during periods where the market is at or near\ncapacity, governments inadvertently inflate the prices faced by other projects (public and private). This can reduce\nthe purchasing power of other departmental budgets, and crowd-out private sector projects that are commercially\nconstrained (Reserve Bank of Australia 2018; Tulipwood Economics 2024).\nStakeholders told us that the inconsistent nature of the infrastructure pipeline can have a detrimental effect on\nproductivity (for example, Australian Constructors Association, sub. 39, p. 11). As periods of strong demand are\nfollowed by periods of subdued activity, contractors are reluctant to invest in their medium and long-term\ncapacity.\nConstruction requires the coordination and mobilisation of a complex and fragmented supply\nchain. The more clarity that can be given to industry on what is in the pipeline and the timeframes\nfor delivery the better these supply chains can managed to deliver the required outcomes …\nCertainty of pipeline is required for contractors to commit to their plan and provides them with\nthe confidence to invest and to enhance their own capability and capacity. (Australian Constructors\nAssociation, sub. 39, p. 11)\nInconsistent volumes of work can be particularly problematic where governments simultaneously fund a large\nnumber of similar infrastructure projects that rely on similar skills, such as the CEP. This burst in demand for\nparticular skills inevitably leads to skills shortages and project bottlenecks. This can create long-term cyclical issues\nas projects that are built at the same time often need to be replaced at the same time.\nStakeholders raised the need for a reliable, single source of truth on the forward infrastructure pipeline to provide\ncertainty and consistency (for example, Australian Constructors Association, sub. 39, p. 11). While the Queensland\nGovernment publishes a forward procurement pipeline, including construction procurement, 95 per cent of the\nprocurement opportunities listed are estimated to go to market by December 2025 (Queensland Government\nn.d.).20 The Commission understands that there is also an internal to government capital pipeline; although, it is\nuncertain how many additional projects are included in the internal pipeline above what is publicly available.\nBoth the Department of Transport and Main Roads (DTMR) and the Department of State Development,\nInfrastructure and Planning (DSDIP) also publish details about the Queensland Government’s planned\ninfrastructure projects. However, it is unclear whether any agency is responsible for overseeing and coordinating\nthe sequencing of Queensland’s whole-of-government capital program, to ensure it is commensurate with market\ncapacity.21\n4.2 Potential directions for reform\nTo reduce pressure on the construction industry, the Queensland Government should undertake a review of its\ncapital program to ensure its forward work program reflects key priorities, whilst being cognisant of market factors,\nincluding impacts on productivity.\nImproving the way the Queensland Government selects and sequences future projects will also be essential for\nimproving future infrastructure outcomes in Queensland.\n20 The forward procurement pipeline is the consolidated pipeline of each of the Queensland Government’s six buying categories’\npipelines (Queensland Government n.d.). Two of these buying categories relate to construction: ‘Building construction and\nmaintenance’ and ‘Transport infrastructure and services’.\n21 While the Coordinator-General does appear to play a role in the planning, delivery and coordination of large-scale\ninfrastructure projects, it does not appear that this role extends to overseeing the coordination of all public infrastructure\nprojects in Queensland, to ensure they are commensurate with market capacity.

This process appears to be excessively complex (Figure 5.2).\n22 The Australian Productivity Commission (2014) found that as contractors do not win all tenders, contractors will aim to recoup\ncosts imposed during the tendering process for both successful and unsuccessful bids via higher costs for the projects they do\nwin.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 102", "text_len": 3667, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

These ambiguities appear to introduce a\nhigh level of subjectivity into procurement decisions. While some flexibility is necessary given multiple objectives\nunder current arrangements, it risks poor outcomes if the procuring officers lack the necessary tools and\nexperience to make the appropriate decision and lends itself to influence by undeclared conflicts of interests and\nparties with vested interests.\nThe Commission has identified the Prequalification System and Ethical Supplier Mandate as key procurement\npolicies where their application appears to be dependent on discretionary decision-making from procuring\nagencies. Preferential treatment, for example under the Local Benefits Test (see following section; Queensland\nGovernment 2019a), similarly provides mechanisms for discretionary decision-making that do not seem beneficial.\nPrequalification (PQC) System\nThe current process to assess the performance of prequalified contractors and subcontractors under the PQC\nSystem also appears likely to allow for potential influence from interest groups.\nProcuring agencies are only required to use prequalified contractors and consultants when a project or commission\nvalue exceeds a particular threshold value (see Box 5.1). As such, this may be distorting the way in which procuring\nagencies estimate the value of their projects or consultant commission fees.\nBox 5.1 Queensland prequalification (PQC) System\nThe PQC System is the Queensland Government’s whole-of-government register of prequalified building\nconsultants and contractors.\nBuilding consultants and contractors must be prequalified and appropriately registered on the PQC\nSystem to be eligible to tender for any Queensland Government building project where the project or\ncommission value meets the following thresholds:\n• Managing contractors must be prequalified if they are directly engaged to work on a Best Practice\nPrinciple (BPP) project (i.e. a project either valued at $100 million or above, or that has been declared a\nBPP project).\n• Building contractors must be prequalified if they are directly contracted on a government building\nproject valued at more than $1 million.

This is likely to reduce competition and make tendering\ndecisions more susceptible to external pressures and undue influence, which in turn increases risks of adverse\noutcomes (in terms of project cost and productivity).\nAs part of initial consultation, stakeholders raised concerns that the requirement for subcontractors to be\nprequalified to work on BPP projects (prior to the temporary suspension) has effectively resulted in these\nsubcontractors being required to enter into union approved Enterprise Bargaining Agreements (EBAs), which offer\nsubstantially more generous conditions than otherwise available in the market. Due to the nature of the EBAs,\nthese contractors are then required to provide these more favourable conditions to their workers across all their\nprojects, essentially making their non-government work ‘uncommercial’.\nStakeholders have told us that this has had a significant impact on competition and project costs in Queensland,\nwith some subcontractors, particularly in the regions, making the decision to not tender for government projects.\n[The] requirement for PQC drives cost prices up in regional areas due to limited [resource] pool …\nthere is thus little differential between Tender responses from the Building Contractor when the\nsame subcontractor has tendered across multiple submissions … Removing the requirement of\nPQC would reduce the administrative burden on contractors and diversify the labour market and\nresource pool, which would increase competition and decrease prices. (Health Infrastructure\nQueensland, sub. 25, p. 4.)\nThere are elements of this [prequalification] system that have the potential to reduce the\nattractiveness to construction companies ... State-based policy does not always fully account for\nthe operation of the construction industry as a national industry, and rather than strengthening\nthe local industry, it can weaken it. (Australian Constructors Association, sub. 39, p. 14.)\nThe duplicative nature of the PQC System was also raised during initial consultation. For example, stakeholders\nadvised the Commission that much of the information required for prequalification duplicates what the\nQueensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC) and other regulators already collect. This is resulting in\ncontractors having to compile and present the same information (i.e. information about financials, experience, past\nperformance, and quality, safety and environmental systems), but in different formats for each.\nStakeholders also noted that in instances when contractors are wanting to work on Australian, state and local\ngovernment projects, contractors are required to be prequalified under each individual government’s\nprequalification scheme.\nConcerns were also raised about the need to ensure that PQC contract and project value thresholds align with\nmarket conditions. While contract and project values have increased significantly over recent years, contract and\nproject value thresholds under the PQC have not been updated.\nPerformance reporting of prequalified building contractors and subcontractors also appears to provide some\ndiscretion for procurement officers to influence how future tender opportunities are awarded. Performance reports,\nfor example, are completed by a departmental employee or a third party engaged by the department (and\napproved by the department) based on what appears to be a subjective scoring methodology.\nThe Commission is seeking further information on how this discretion is applied in practice, and whether there is\nsufficient transparency on how decisions are made. The Commission is also seeking stakeholder views on how\nduplicative requirements can be minimised.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 105", "text_len": 4321, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This includes instances\nwhere a contractor or subcontractor fails to meet wage and entitlement standards consistent with provisions set\nout in the Ethical Supplier Threshold (Queensland Government 2024e).\nWhile most of the Mandate process appears to sit within the responsibility of the Queensland Government\nProcurement Compliance Branch, the Tripartite Procurement Advisory Panel (the Panel) — prior to the lapse of its\nlatest membership24 — held sole responsibility for recommending how agencies penalised instances of non-\ncompliance. The Panel was appointed by government and comprised of an independent chair and deputy chair, 5\nunion representatives and 5 employer representatives.\nWhile in theory the use of an advisory panel can be an effective mechanism, in practice, its effectiveness is highly\ndependent on the independence of its recommendations, as well as the composition and impartiality of the\nmembers of the panel. If the panel’s settings are not appropriate, including improper controls to prevent external\nparties from influencing procurement decisions, there is the potential for poor outcomes in the form of inflated\nproject costs and lower project productivity.\nGiven the Mandate appears to serve little purpose but carries significant risk, creates compliance burden on both\nagencies and contractors, and duplicates existing legislative and contractual provisions, it is likely the costs\nassociated with the Mandate and Ethical Supplier Threshold would outweigh any benefits they provide. As such,\nthere appears to be compelling case to remove both from Queensland Government Procurement Policy.\nProcurement objectives beyond value for money\nMany of the Queensland Government's procurement policies are designed to achieve objectives beyond value for\nmoney. By focusing on alternative objectives, these policies implicitly preference contractors that are better at\ndemonstrating how they can deliver against these objectives, rather than contractors that can deliver the highest\nvalue for money for the Queensland community. This, in turn, incentivises firms to alter their business priorities,\nwith potential impacts on site productivity and project costs.\nStakeholders indicated that these alternative objectives are most effectively achieved organically, by having a\nproductive construction industry. For example, more productive firms have greater capacity to train apprentices,\nuse more sustainable materials, and provide better conditions for workers.\nProcurement policies should further consider that there really are no such thing as non-financial\nbenefits that exist independent of financial benefits. Social benefits can occur organically, as a side\neffect of working towards financial benefits. A business that is doing well financially can afford to\nhire and train more people, seek out better materials, and upskill groups that are often neglected\n– these are by products of financial benefits and done because it is in the financial interest of the\nbusiness to do so. (Civil Contractors Federation Queensland, pers. comm.)\nThe Supplier Code of Conduct\nThe Supplier Code of Conduct (Queensland Government 2023c) outlines the government’s expectations of\ncontractors. It includes 17 expectations of suppliers that are unrelated to fundamental value for money principles.\nWhile many of these expectations relate to legal obligations, there are numerous expectations that compel\ncontractors to contribute towards social and environmental government objectives. Stakeholders told us these\nrequirements unnecessarily add compliance costs to government projects.\n24 On 31 March 2025, the Queensland Government allowed for the previous appointment of the Panel to lapse while it\nundertakes a compliance review. This review is part of a broader Queensland Procurement Policy review currently being\nundertaken (Department of Housing and Public Works 2025c).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 106", "text_len": 4282, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

While the broad objective may\nbe sound, it is not clear that delivering environmental outcomes through procurement is a cost-effective approach.\nRather, it may simply result in contractors providing expensive site-specific solutions that deliver few real\nenvironmental and sustainability outcomes. As such, procurement policies are likely to be a poor policy instrument\nfor delivering this objective.\nBased on currently available information the costs associated with the Supplier Code of Conduct, in its current\nform, appear to exceed the benefits associated with it. If this is the case, the Supplier Code of Conduct should\neither be removed or be provided as a guide only.\nThe Queensland Government Building and Construction Training Policy\nAnother procurement policy that aims to achieve additional objectives is the Queensland Government's Building\nand Construction Training Policy (the Training Policy) (Queensland Government 2024j). The Training Policy\nmandates 15 per cent of total labour hours on large government projects be allocated to apprentices or trainees or\nbe dedicated to other forms of workforce training.25 The Training Policy aims to complement existing government\nsubsidies to correct for a perceived private sector underinvestment.\nAgain, it is not clear that procurement policies are an effective or efficient instrument for achieving higher\napprenticeship rates. Under current arrangements, contractors are required to employ apprentices at a minimum\nlevel across all government projects, rather than matching apprentices to the needs of the market. As no\nassessment is made about whether government projects are likely to provide training opportunities that match skill\nshortages in the market, the policy is blunt in its implementation and may draw apprentices away from other parts\nof the market.\nThe policy is also likely to be inefficient in the sense that it does not allow employers to match apprentices to those\nprojects where they can be most efficiently utilised (for example, by employing apprentices on projects where the\nproductivity differential between them and experienced tradespeople is less pronounced).\nStakeholders questioned whether the Training Policy was resulting in a net addition of apprentices, suggesting\nlarger government contractors tend to poach more experienced apprentices from smaller firms to satisfy\napprenticeship requirements, rather than providing new apprenticeship opportunities:\nContractors are required to ensure a certain number of apprentices and trainees on government\nprojects (which is passed down to subcontractors to implement), though there is no requirement\nthat they be new to the industry (e.g., 1st year apprentices). As a result, larger businesses working\non government projects are incentivised to entice 3rd or 4th year apprentices from local small\nbusinesses, offering higher wages. This leads to small businesses going through the more difficult\nearly years with an apprentice with greater levels of supervision and less productivity of the\nbusiness, only for the apprentice to leave once they become more productive. (Master Electricians\nAustralia, sub. 37, p. 17.)\nAdditionally, while workforce training is important for upskilling the industry, it is unclear that mandating\ncontractors to use labour hours on major government projects to undertake workforce training is efficient. Rather,\nallowing firms the flexibility to train their staff when it is more suitable for them, such as when workers are between\nprojects, may enable firms to utilise their staff more efficiently.\nStakeholders indicated that training targets incorporated into procurement policies are not necessarily effective, as\ncontractor’s willingness to upskill their workforce is often driven by recognised skills shortages.\n25 The Training Policy applies to Queensland Government building projects with a contract sum of $500,000 or greater, and civil\nconstruction projects with a contract sum of $3 million or greater. The Training Policy requires at least 60 per cent of the\ndeemed training hours be toward the employment of apprentices and trainees, with the remaining deemed hours allocated to\nother workforce training.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 107", "text_len": 4448, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 110, "text": "General procurement policies\nContractors also reported that training targets set by procurement policies and contracts were\neither unhelpful or had no impact on their willingness or ability to upskill their workforce. This is\nbecause the recognised shortage of skills is a primary driver for them to upskill their workforce.\nHowever, skilling targets or quotas are useful to ensure all of industry regardless of their\nappreciation for the skills shortage work to drive the overall skilling requirements. (Civil\nContractors Federation Queensland, pers. comm.)\nWhile there may be a case for increasing apprenticeship rates and workforce training, it is not clear that\nprocurement policies are the best instrument for achieving this outcome. It is likely that government absorbs the\ncost of these apprentice-worked hours through elevated project costs, but there is no clear way to determine the\nextent of these costs, or whether the policy is addressing skill shortages in the market.\nLocal benefits test\nDespite the prevalence of policies that preference local suppliers across Australian governments, there is little\neconomic rationale for their usage. In many cases they are unnecessary because local construction firms have a\nnatural advantage, given their close proximity and knowledge about operating with local conditions, supply\nnetworks and labour markets (PC 2014, pp. 472–475). For example, at the national level in 2023-24, 94 per cent of\nCommonwealth contracts were awarded to Australian suppliers (Commonwealth Department of Finance 2025).\nWhere policies result in genuine preferential treatment, they tend to make the targeted industries less competitive\nand less innovative, while also creating inefficiencies across the broader economy by redirecting resources away\nfrom more productive industries (OECD 2019; PC 2024b). Stakeholders flagged their frustrations with the added\ncosts local procurement policies impose for the questionable benefits they deliver:\nThe local procurement policies of Queensland government disincentivise the use of resources from\ninterstate or through offshoring, and require substantial effort in tendering, data collection and\nsystems to complete reporting for unknown benefits. Consult Australia recommends Queensland\ngovernment engage with other state and territory governments to explore alternative models that\nreduce the regulatory impose and increase available resources for project delivery. (Consult\nAustralia, sub. 28, p. 17.)\nSimilarly, stakeholders involved in renewable energy projects have raised concerns about the administrative burden\nof complying with the local benefits test (Queensland Renewable Energy Council, sub. 68, p. 3). The policy may be\nrestricting the commercial viability of renewable energy projects, especially smaller projects that do not generate\nsufficient profit to allocate resources towards searching for local suppliers.\nUnder the Local Benefits Test, procuring officers are responsible for deciding the weighting to apply to local\nbenefits. Given the latitude this provides procuring officers, it is likely to decrease transparency and increase the\nscope for external influence.\nStakeholders told us that smaller regional firms are constrained from competing for government tenders by the\nPQC system and the onerous reporting requirements associated with government projects (Project Legal, sub. 60,\np. 5; Master Builders Queensland, sub. 43, p. 11). Local businesses may benefit more from the removal of these\nbarriers to their participation in procurement policies and processes, rather than by using explicit preferential\nprocurement policies.\nQueensland Renewable Energy Procurement Policy\nElevated project costs are particularly problematic for Queensland's energy-generating Government-Owned\nCorporations (GOCs) as they operate in a commercially competitive environment. The Queensland Renewable\nEnergy Procurement Policy (QREPP) (Queensland Government 2024m) applies Queensland's broader procurement\npolicy to the construction of GOC-owned renewable energy projects.\nBy requiring GOCs to procure renewable energy projects under more restrictive procurement policies than their\nprivate competitors, GOC projects are likely to have inflated construction costs.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 108", "text_len": 4288, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Key conditions include: |  | \n |  | • Wage rates, including specified penalty rates and allowances for different tasks, projects and building |  | \n |  | types |  | \n |  | • 26 rostered days off (RDOs), requiring full site closure |  | \n |  | • Explicit stop work conditions relating to inclement weather conditions |  | \n |  | • Requirements for any changes to rosters, hours of work including overtime, and the selection of |  | \n |  | subcontractors, to be agreed in accordance with the relevant union. |  | \n |  | In addition to these provisions, BPICs provide union delegates significant powers on building sites, |  | \n |  | including powers to call site meetings, cease work due to safety concerns and review building material |  | \n |  | and employment records to ensure compliance with the policy. |  | \n |  | Contractors engaged on applicable Queensland Government projects are required to have in place legally |  | \n |  | binding and enforceable workplace arrangements with conditions of employment that meet or exceed |  | \n |  | the minimum conditions of employment set out in BPICs policies. |  | \n |  | Head contractors and subcontractors have as a result entered into enterprise bargaining agreements |  | \n |  | (EBAs) with the same conditions as outlined in the BPICs policies. |  | \n |  | According to stakeholders, BPICs-like conditions have become the industry standard for infrastructure |  | \n |  | projects in Queensland, because: |  | \n |  | • As discussed above, Tier 1 contractors and subcontractors tendering for BPICs projects have needed to |  | \n |  | have EBAs with BPICs-compliant provisions embedded in order to be eligible for government work.

The temporary\nsuspension applies to:\n• all new major government-funded projects\n• projects that have not reached the procurement stage\n• projects in procurement, where future stages have not been finalised, or where there is no approved EBA (or\nindustrial instrument) – on a project-by-project basis.\nThe temporary suspension is to remain in place until the Queensland Productivity Commission (the Commission)\nhas completed an assessment of the economic impacts of BPICs and the government has responded (Queensland\nGovernment 2024f). However, BPICs still apply on many sites where work was already underway at the time the\npolicy was paused.\nWhile BPICs increase wages and conditions for construction\nworkers, they are likely to impose costs on the community\nWages and conditions under BPICs appear to be substantially more favourable to workers than otherwise available\nin the broader industry. While these provide direct benefits to construction workers, concerns have been raised by\nstakeholders about impacts on:\n• the cost of delivering the Queensland Government’s capital works program\n• the broader economy, by diverting labour from private to public construction and bidding up construction\nindustry costs.\nBPICs wages and conditions are now embedded in EBAs for many Tier 1 firms and contractors, with many in place\nuntil July 2027. Stakeholders have told us that this has had a significant impact on project costs and competition.\nBPIC has reduced the attractiveness of Queensland to contractors as it has resulted in delivery\ncosts being substantially higher than other jurisdictions with little appetite from clients to accept\nthese higher costs. Further, non-EBA employers are reluctant to enter the Queensland market\nwhere there will be pressure to meet the benchmark that has been set through BPIC.

While this analysis differs from our modelling, in that\nit does not consider a counterfactual with no BPICs (i.e. it does not consider that the implementation of BPICs is\nlikely to have influenced wages rates on non-BPICs sites), the Commission also modelled an alternative scenario\nwhere wage rates are no higher on BPICs sites.\nThis analysis shows that even if wages were assumed to be unaltered by BPICs, significant net economic costs\nwould still be imposed on the community (see Table 6.2). These net costs are only slightly lower than the core\nmodelled scenarios ($18.4 billion versus $20.6 billion for the high scenarios). These results are in line with evidence\nprovided by stakeholders that a key driver of costs from BPICs are from productivity losses rather than wage rates.\nTable 6.2 Revised estimated net impacts, no wage differences, Queensland, $ million, NPV\nLow scenario High scenario\nConstruction workers 1,207 3,939\nTaxpayers -2,588 -10,542\nCommunity -725 -2,901\nLandlords 1,416 4,863\nExisting homeowners 476 2,069\nRenters and first home buyers -2,760 -10,727\nBusinesses -1,435 -5,140\nTotal -4,409 -18,438\nSource: QPC.\nThere appears to be a case for permanently removing BPICs from\nGovernment procurement policy\nGiven the apparent large and negative impacts that BPICs have on the broader community, there seems to be a\nstrong case for their permanent removal from Queensland Government procurement policy.\nA preliminary review suggests that most of the workplace health and safety obligations in BPICs are either covered\nalready in existing legislation and codes of practice or in relevant awards.\nFor example, the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 requires that any person conducting a business or undertaking\n(including construction businesses) have a duty to ensure the health and safety of workers. Under the Act, workers\nalso have a say on health and safety matters in the workplace through formal mechanisms — these were recently\nsignificantly strengthened under the Work Health and Safety and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2024. There are\nalso other provisions in the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 that should provide incentives for worker safety,\nincluding industrial manslaughter provisions.\nSimilarly, the Building and Construction General Award provides provisions for work during inclement weather,\nincluding that workers are not required to commence or continue work when it is unsafe to do so.\nWhere the BPICs are more prescriptive than in the award or relevant legislation, it is not clear that these\nprescriptive elements have provided any additional safety benefits. For example, the Construction BPICs specify\nthat where temperatures exceed 35 degrees or 29 degrees and 75 per cent humidity, there should be an orderly\ncessation of work. However, less prescriptive awards and legislation also make it clear that work should not be\nundertaken during hot weather, where it is unsafe to do so.\nThose additional conditions in BPICs appear to provide few safety benefits but impose large costs on project\nproponents. As such, BPICs appear to be an inefficient mechanism to achieve health and safety outcomes.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 117\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  |  |  | Low scenario |  |  | High scenario | \nConstruction workers |  |  | 1,207 |  |  | 3,939 |  | \nTaxpayers |  |  | -2,588 |  |  | -10,542 |  | \nCommunity |  |  | -725 |  |  | -2,901 |  | \nLandlords |  |  | 1,416 |  |  | 4,863 |  | \nExisting homeowners |  |  | 476 |  |  | 2,069 |  | \nRenters and first home buyers |  |  | -2,760 |  |  | -10,727 |  | \nBusinesses |  |  | -1,435 |  |  | -5,140 |  | \nTotal |  |  | -4,409 |  |  | -18,438 |  | ", "text_len": 3862, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Rather, these should be commercial decisions that reflect market conditions.\nThere may be benefits from government or industry action on some objectives currently covered by BPICs, for\nexample, the BPICs' objectives in relation to mental health, or encouraging greater workforce diversity to make the\nconstruction industry more appealing for new entrants. Where this is the case, these objectives are likely more\neffectively and efficiently addressed through other levers rather than BPICs.\n6.2 Options for proceeding\nBased on the potentially high costs and limited evidence of public benefits, the Commission’s preliminary view is\nthat BPICs should be permanently removed.\nHowever, as noted by many stakeholders, BPICs-like provisions are now embedded in EBAs until mid-2027 for\nmost Tier 1 contractors and subcontractors who undertake work on government projects.

{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 123, "text": "Contracting for efficiency\nStakeholders have raised concerns that contracting arrangements are outdated, cumbersome and are preventing\ninnovation. Stakeholders also noted that contractual arrangements typically contain excessively rigid specifications\nthat include both means and methods, rather than focussing on the outputs required. If true, this is likely to\nprevent innovation and unnecessarily increase construction costs.\n7.1 Current risk allocations may be suboptimal\nStakeholders have raised concerns that contractual arrangements with the Queensland Government do not\nallocate risk in a way that is efficient.\nSome standard government contract clauses are placing too much risk on contractors, which\ncannot be adequately priced up front by the contractor. These practices drive a 'race to the bottom'\nresulting in insufficient contingency, cash flow and profit. (Master Builders Queensland 2025b, p.\n6 as referred to in sub. 43, p. 11)\nRisks should be allocated to the contractual party best able to manage them and should align with the incentives\nof each contractual party. That is, risks should be credibly allocated to those who can mitigate them for least cost\nand for those that cannot be mitigated, to the party best able to absorb the specified risk (PC 2014). In practice,\nhowever, the allocation of risk is often more complex.\nGovernments allocate risk using different public infrastructure delivery models, with the most appropriate\ncontracting arrangement dependent on the type, size, level of uncertainty and cost of the project scope, as well as\nthe risk appetite and capability of the procuring agency. Ensuring project risks are allocated efficiently across\nstakeholders is also essential for ensuring that public infrastructure projects provide the greatest net benefit to the\ncommunity (PC 2014).\nWhere risks are inappropriately allocated, this is likely to result in increased project costs. For example, when\ncontractors are required to take on risk that they are unable to manage or price (due to a lack of reliable\ninformation, or because the risk is controlled by government), the contractor will either withdraw their bid or factor\nthis risk premium into their bid price, resulting in an increase in project costs.\nWhere contractors 'over-price' risk, this will result in the procuring agency 'overpaying' for the project; while in\ninstances where contractors 'under-price' risk, if the risk eventuates, the contractor may end up in a dispute with\nthe client for some level of compensation, resulting in the procuring agency potentially 'overpaying' for the project.\nIt is important to note that while reducing the level of risks borne by contractors may reduce the tender price, it\nmay not necessarily reduce the overall project costs. For example, where procuring agencies lack project\nmanagement and/or construction expertise, the allocation of these risks to government is likely to result in\nincreased project costs. It could be argued that in these instances, government may not be best placed to take on\nthese risks (PC 2014).\nThere are also likely to be significant issues for construction productivity where the misallocation of risk results in\ninefficient outcomes, either because contractors are disincentivised to use more efficient or innovative construction\nmethods, or because it distorts firm behaviours.\nFor example, stakeholders have mentioned that contractual arrangements often mean head contractors pass risks\nonto subcontractors who have limited ability to manage or mitigate them, which has contributed to a declining\nparticipation in public infrastructure projects by efficient subcontractors.\nAccording to the Australian Constructors Association (sub. 39, p. 18) this re-allocation of risk has contributed to the\nfragmented nature of the construction supply chain and the dominance of smaller firms, with each player seeking\nto minimise their exposure to risk.\nSimilarly, the Australian Constructors Association (sub. 39, p. 18) identifies the allocation of pricing risk to\ncontractors in an uncertain project environment as being one of the primary drivers of low margins and high\nnumber of insolvencies in the sector as well as the lack of investment in innovation in the industry.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 121", "text_len": 4281, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 124, "text": "Contracting for efficiency\nMost stakeholder concerns have been raised in the context of fixed price contracts, where contractors are required\nto provide a fixed price at the time of tender, despite there often being high levels of uncertainty around key\nelements of the project (including those controlled by government), which limits the tenderer's ability to accurately\nprice the project.\nMore broadly, stakeholders have raised concerns with the lack of collaboration and information sharing between\nparties as a key driver of perceived unfair risk allocations.\nThe lack of collaboration through procurement and into delivery has proven problematic… Risk\nallocation is best managed between the parties collaboratively so that each party understands the\ndrivers and challenges of the other and how to best manage the relevant risks and work together\nto minimise the occurrence and the costs of managing the risks. This does not mean that all risks\nare shared, rather that a collaborative conversation is held between all parties. This can be done\nfor all contract types, regardless of whether they are collaborative contracts such as alliances and\nECI's all the way through to construct only contracts. (Queensland Major Contractors Association,\nsub. 66, p. 26)\nThe overriding goal of contracting must shift from a focus on transferring all risks to the contractor\nat the outset - particularly unquantifiable risks - to establishing the rules by which the parties will\njointly manage these risks as they inevitably arise throughout delivery… While no contract can\naccount for all the unexpected events that will complicate delivery, contracts can incorporate\nmechanisms to encourage clients and contractors to work together to resolve issues fairly and\nreasonably and to avoid disputes. (Australian Constructors Association, sub. 39, p. 19)\nStakeholders suggested that one potential option for improving collaboration and the management of risk is the\nincreased use of digital models, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), throughout the procurement\nprocess, with calls for government to transition away from a 'digital by exception' to 'digital by default' approach\nto procurement.\nQueensland Major Contractors Association, for example, states that:\nEnabling and allowing the greater use of BIM and other solutions as part of the procurement and\ndelivery process will result in far more efficiency and productivity as the need for paper based\ndesign drawings is reduced, and all parties can review and approve designs in live time.\n(Queensland Major Contractors Association, sub. 66, pp. 27-28)\nConsult Australia (sub. 28, p. 10) notes that while Queensland has had a coordinated whole-of-government\napproach to BIM since 2018, adoption has been slow and the opportunities surrounding the use of digital\ntechnologies are yet to be fully leveraged.\nThe Commission is interested to hear from stakeholders about the extent to which an increased use of digital\ntechnologies is likely to improve collaboration and the perceived allocation of risk between parties. The\nCommission is also interested to understand what the key barriers to increased use of digital technologies (within\nthe procurement process) are and what policies and practices are likely to increase adoption.\n7.2 Standard contracts may reduce compliance\nburdens\nStakeholders have raised concerns about the increased use of non-standard contracts (including standard contract\nforms with significant variations) across Queensland Government projects.\nA significant challenge to the productivity of the construction sector is the variation in contract\nforms not only between jurisdictions, but within jurisdictions and even within a delivery agency.\n(Australian Constructors Association, sub. 39, p. 20)\nQueensland Productivity Commission 122", "text_len": 3812, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 125, "text": "Contracting for efficiency\nThere is now an increasing tendency to use heavily modified standard forms or revert to drafting\nbespoke contracts for individual projects. This has eroded the efficiency gains from standard forms\nand created more inefficiencies and disputes arising from their interpretation. (Queensland Major\nContractors Association, sub. 66, p. 27)\nMany stakeholders have raised concerns that this deviation from standard form contracts has resulted in an\nincrease in complexity of contracts, and higher tendering costs, with special consultants and lawyers often required\nto review and interpret contracts on behalf of contractors during each tendering process, as well as manage\ndisputes arising from differing interpretations of the non-standard contract.\nStakeholders have recommended the Queensland Government develop a suite of standard and common contracts\nthat can be applied with minimal variation, citing that a return to standard forms could save substantial time and\ncosts. Where variations are required, stakeholders suggest this should occur in rare circumstances and used where\nstrictly necessary and by agreement with bidders. According to the Australian Constructors Association (sub. 39, p.\n20), up until recently, this used to be standard practice in the Queensland Department of Transport and Main\nRoads.\nWhile the use of standardised contracts can provide efficiency gains for stakeholders by reducing the time and cost\nrequired to review, interpret and manage contractual obligations, there are likely to be instances where a standard\ncontract does not provide the flexibility or specific requirements needed to effectively deliver a project. However,\nthere appears to be merit in minimising contract variations, with variations only occurring when necessary.\nThe Commission would like to better understand whether the use of standard contracts can provide greater\nconsistency across Queensland Government agencies and greater certainty for industry, which elements lend\nthemselves best to standardisation, and whether moves to use standardised contracts would create any\nunnecessary risk.\n7.3 Risk aversion can be a barrier to innovation\nSeveral stakeholders have raised concerns that a culture of risk aversion within the Queensland Government\nprevents the use of more innovative solutions to infrastructure provision and construction.\nWhile there is an inherent balance between being overly risk averse and accepting excessive risk, several\nstakeholders raised that procuring agencies are currently erring on the side of being too risk averse, and this is a\nbarrier to innovation (for example, BuildSkills Australia, sub. 24, p. 17; Queensland Major Contractors Association,\nsub. 66, p. 37).\nIndustry bodies mentioned that while some procuring agencies initially welcome innovative approaches or\ntechnologies, they inevitably reject them due to risk aversion. According to Consult Australia (sub. 28, p. 9), the\nQueensland Government rarely considers the use of innovative technologies, even where they can be\ndemonstrated to have been used successfully in other jurisdictions or countries.\nQMCA used the Rockhampton Ring Road as an example project where cost-saving approaches used interstate\nwere declined in Queensland:\nThrough the project development phase, the client and their engineers were challenged over the\ndesign with different approaches and technical solutions that have been accepted interstate that\nwould have saved significant costs and improved the likely time for delivery, but these suggestions\nwere declined.

{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 126, "text": "Contracting for efficiency\nStakeholders raised that government risk aversion is enabled through overly prescriptive tender documents. While\nsome level of prescriptiveness in tender documents is necessary to ensure projects are delivered to a minimum\nstandard, there are concerns prescribed specifications are used mainly to make it easier for procuring officers to\nmake comparisons between competing tenders:\nAssessment panels often appear to want innovation avoided, to facilitate direct comparison of\ntenders, potentially due to risk aversion, avoidance of ownership, or incompetence. (Queensland\nMajor Contractors Association, sub. 66, p. 26)\nStakeholders suggested government procurement should make greater use of performance specifications, as they\nallow contractors to propose innovative approaches to deliver projects without compromising quality:\nPrescriptive specifications are seen as undermining productivity, ensuring uniformity but hindering\ninnovation and leading to outdated methods. They can blow out costs and have unintended\nconsequences. An alternative approach is to use performance specifications, which define how the\nfinal asset must perform (e.g., bridge capacity, start/end points, design life). This allows contractors\nto compete on the best solution to meet the brief, rather than just the price of a fixed product.\n(Queensland Major Contractors Association, sub. 66, p. 27)\nWhile there may be benefits from adopting a less prescriptive approach to government procurement of\ninfrastructure, there are also significant impediments that need to be considered.\nFor example, if government wishes to introduce more innovation by using less prescriptive approaches, procuring\nagencies would need to:\n• Ensure they have sufficient expertise (and time) to understand and assess the proposed solution, including any\nassessment of risk;\n• Have clear guidance on what is acceptable risk, and sufficient incentives for decision makers to make\nassessments and decisions on risk.\nStakeholders voiced concerns that concepts included in unsuccessful bids were then used by procuring agencies in\nfuture projects and when projects are retendered. This may be contributing to the industry’s poor uptake of\ninnovative solutions as tenderers are deterred from incorporating innovative approaches in bids.\nSome stakeholders suggested procurement policy should actively seek innovative proposals in bids. While there\nmay be some benefit in this approach, care needs to be taken that procurement does not seek innovation for its\nown sake, as this could reallocate risk to government, who may not be the best party to manage it. A procuring\nmodel that is focussed on maximising value for money, has appropriate guidance on risk, and is backed by\nsufficient technical expertise in procuring agencies, should allow contractors and subcontractors to utilise\ninnovative, lower cost solutions, without explicitly requesting their usage.\nGiven the potential for improved outcomes and lower costs, there seems to be benefit in exploring options, such\nas performance-based contracting, for increasing innovation in infrastructure provision. However, this may require\na significant investment in capability building and a commitment by government to appropriately delegate risk.\n7.4 Early contractor engagement may help improve\nproject outcomes\nStakeholders suggested that, under current procurement processes, procuring agencies were not collaborating\nwith contractors early enough in the project development process (for example, Consult Australia, sub. 28, pp. 8-9;\nHealth Infrastructure Queensland, sub. 25, p. 2). According to BuildSkills Australia (sub. 24, p. 17), early contractor\ninvolvement may help to improve constructability, reduce rework, and facilitate the adoption of innovative\ntechniques.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 124", "text_len": 3840, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 127, "text": "Contracting for efficiency\nAn early contractor involvement procurement model is considered particularly beneficial on projects that include\ndifficult-to-price risks. Working collaboratively at this stage of a project’s development can enable both the client\nand contractor to appropriately allocate risk and reduce costs (Infrastructure Australia 2012). This sentiment was\nalso echoed by stakeholders:\nEngaging with contractors at the planning stage will also allow for better identification and\nassessment of risk. This allows early discussion about appropriate risk allocation. (Australian\nConstructors Association, sub. 39, p. 13)\nWhile early contractor involvement can take an array of forms, it is most commonly used in the form of a two-\nstage contract, with the contractor engaged at the initial scoping stages of the project (Infrastructure Australia\n2012; PC 2014).\nInitial tendering under this contract form involves tenderers competing on their fees to develop the project design,\nnot based on their estimate of delivering the project. The winning contractor then works collaboratively with their\ndesign consultants and the client to revise the project brief and refine the project design.\nBased on the finalised project brief and design, the contractor will make an offer to the client to subsequently build\nthe project. At this point, the client has the option to either accept this offer, or to decline it and re-tender for\nanother contractor to construct the project based on the project brief and design delivered in the first stage.\nThe Queensland Government, through the Queensland Government Building Policy Guideline (Queensland\nGovernment 2023a), previously required major projects to be procured using a two-stage contract.\nWhile two-stage contracting can help to bring contractor involvement early in the design phase (with the\nexpectation it will help to increase innovation) it is not suitable for use in every circumstance and can be difficult to\nimplement in practice.\nFor example, the use of two-stage contracts was found to be problematic through the Queensland Government's\nHospital Capacity Expansion Program because of the prevailing market conditions, including capacity constraints,\nsubcontractor registration, and BPICs requirements (Klok Advisory 2025).\nThe Queensland Government has subsequently removed any requirement for major projects to use two-stage\ncontracts and has allowed other contract types to be used for all projects.\nAlliance contracting is another alternative contract type that involves early contractor engagement by essentially\nturning a project into a joint venture. Alliance contracts are often considered most useful in situations where the\nclient has limited experience assessing specific project risk (PC 2014).\nAlliance models require even greater collaboration between the client and contractor than two-stage contracts. For\nthis reason, the tendering process often requires key personnel from the client-side and tenderer-side to engage in\nworkshops and role playing scenarios to examine how effectively they work together. Subsequently, alliance\npartners are often selected on non-price considerations (PC 2014).\nAlthough dated, the New Perth-Bunbury Highway (NPBH) was an example of a seemingly successful project\ndelivered under an alliance contract model. This contract model was selected because it offered greater flexibility\nin achieving value for money and was considered the best approach to manage the project risks (Infrastructure\nAustralia 2012).\nAn additional benefit of the particular alliance used for the NPBH was that it included a subcontractor that was\nable to ensure a supply of raw materials at a time where there was strong competition from major resource\nprojects (Infrastructure Australia 2012). The Queensland Major Contractors Association (sub. 66, p. 20) raised the\nvalue in the early engagement of delivery partners that play a critical role in the supply chain.\nWhile the use of alliance contracting models may be appropriate for some projects, this will not be the case for all.\nIt does not seem to be used often in Australia, although stakeholders did suggest that this should change (for\nexample, see BuildSkills Australia, sub. 24, p. 17).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 125", "text_len": 4275, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The Staples Review of DTMR’s Queensland Transport\nand Roads Investment Program (Staples 2025) recommended that early market engagement during the planning\nphase should be embedded into major projects to help assess market capacity and test delivery timeframes and\npackaging approaches.\nThe Queensland Major Contractors Association made a similar recommendation while noting the lack of contractor\nengagement at the early project concept development stage:\nQMCA believes there is generally a lack of construction knowledge incorporated in the concept\nstage, and this actively hinders productivity in later stages. It should be recognised that a\ncontractors can provide solutions and pragmatic delivery ideas that can assist with not restricting\nproductivity during delivery… On large programs and projects establish an early-stage market\nsounding process that engages one or more contractors to help test concepts and ideas around\nwhat is practical to be built. This will help deliver more efficient and well thought out solutions\nleading to more efficient allocation of resources during the design and construction phases.\n(Queensland Major Contractors Association, sub. 66, p. 20)\nThe Commission is seeking further stakeholder feedback on the pros and cons of early contractor engagement\nmodels, including examples where they have been used successfully, what agency capabilities are required, the key\nbarriers to their uptake, and how incentives can be arranged to maximise success.\n7.5 Delays in the tendering process inefficiently tie\nup capacity\nStakeholders raised concerns with the length of time between when tender bids are submitted and when the\ntender is awarded. A lengthy tender decision process creates two problems. These relate to the tender's validity\nperiod, and the need for prospective contractors to put resources on hold while awaiting a decision.\nFirst, the tender will include quotes for construction materials that may only be valid for a certain period. While\ntenders often include 'tender validity periods', this period can still be long enough for volatile materials to\nsignificantly rise in price, with the tenderer responsible for this risk. Further, once the tender validity period does\nexpire, it is unclear whether tenderers can submit another tender with updated prices, or if their only recourse is to\nwithdraw their tender.\nSecond, as prospective contractors are required to quarantine staff in case they are the successful bidder, delays in\nawarding contracts can increase opportunity costs for businesses:\nThe procurement process for large projects appears needlessly long, potentially taking up to 18\nmonths… Even after tenders are submitted, the decision period can take many months, sometimes\nlonger than the time spent preparing the tender, leaving bid teams and proposed delivery teams\non hold. The process involves a contractor team not much smaller than the construction team\nitself. (Queensland Major Contractors Association, sub. 66, p. 25).\nAccording to the Australian Constructors Association (sub. 39, p. 14), Queensland has recently been poor at\nawarding tenders before the validity period expires:\nIn a recent independent survey of ACA members, undertaken by Oxford Economics, Queensland\nperformed below expectations against measures assessing the extent to which contracts are\nawarded within the original tender validity period. This was consistent with broader national\ntrends. Possibly this trend has some relationship to the volume of documentation that bidders must\nprovide and the time needed for tender evaluation boards to then review and evaluate what has\nbeen submitted.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 126", "text_len": 3870, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Further suggested remedies by stakeholders included shortening tender validity\nperiods to below 90 days and including key performance indicators for departments to minimise the time taken to\naward tenders.\nThe Commission is interested in further stakeholder feedback on the consequences of, and possible solutions to,\nthe effects of a delayed and lengthy tender decision process.\n7.6 Unreliable information about site risks leads to\nduplication of effort\nProcuring agencies often undertake preliminary investigations to gather information on site-specific project risks,\nsuch as geotechnical, environmental and utilities assessments, to inform their decisions about a project's viability.\nThis information is then distributed to tenderers.\nHowever, tenderers are often contractually precluded from relying on this information. This means each tenderer\nmust either replicate the process of gathering this information, or price in the risk that the information is\ninaccurate.\nThe Australian Constructors Association (sub. 39, p. 15) and Queensland Major Contractors Association (sub. 66, p.\n23) indicated that time and money are wasted through duplication. Given tenderers will seek to recoup the costs of\nthese investigations regardless of whether they are the successful tenderer, the client will inevitably pay for these\ninvestigations through higher bid prices (including for future projects).\nFurther, due to compressed tender timeframes, these tenderer investigations are typically not sufficiently detailed\nto appropriately assess the likely risks involved with any given project. This can lead to bids incorporating risk\npremiums that overestimate the true value of the risk (PC 2014).\nStaples (2025) recommended allocating adequate funding to complete these assessments during the business case\nphase of a project, as this enables more robust planning and reduces risk during procurement delivery. This\nsupports stakeholder claims that the client is best placed to undertake thorough investigations in advance of the\ntender process, and that allowing tenderers to rely on information provided would reduce bid costs.\n7.7 Contracting issues are exacerbated for small and\nregional firms\nStakeholders have raised concerns that compliance costs imposed by current contracting arrangements\ndisproportionately impact smaller, less resourced firms:\nQueensland Government building contracts now seem to require onerous reporting requirements\nto meet state government policy objectives (e.g. training policies) which small contractors do not\nhave the resources to meet. Government construction and procurement contracts need to be\nstandardised (at both state and local government level) and simplified for small value work.\n(Project Legal, sub. 60, p. 5)\nAs discussed above, stakeholders have also raised concerns that subcontractors are often required to manage and\nabsorb risks passed down to them from head contractors, despite often not having sufficient mechanisms to cover\nthe costs of these risks if they eventuate. For example, subcontractors may be required to absorb unexpected\nmaterial and labour cost escalations due to market volatility or changes to project scope, both of which are likely\nto be out of their control. According to stakeholders, this is further exacerbated by the fact that subcontractors\ngenerally work off smaller margins than larger firms.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 127", "text_len": 3573, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 130, "text": "Contracting for efficiency\nStakeholders have noted concerns about instances of procurement behaviours perpetuated by contractors that\nsystematically disadvantage small to medium enterprises (SMEs), such as bid shopping - where a head contractor\ndiscloses one subcontractor's bid to another to secure a lower price. They say this results in subcontractors either\nwithdrawing their bids or increasing their bid price to offset risk.\nStakeholders have also told the Commission that project bundling can disproportionately impact SMEs. While\nthere are likely to be efficiency gains through the government bundling projects together, often the trade-off is\nreduced competition, whereby the bundling of multiple projects may prevent smaller firms from tendering for\nwork.\n7.8 Where to from here?\nStakeholders have raised concerns that Queensland Government contracting arrangements are outdated,\ncumbersome and are preventing innovation. Stakeholders told us that contractual arrangements typically contain\nexcessively rigid specifications that include both means and methods, rather than focussing on the outputs\nrequired. If true, this is likely to prevent innovation and is likely to unnecessarily increase construction costs.\nWhile the Commission is still assessing submissions and is seeking further information from stakeholders, initial\nstakeholder suggestions indicate there are opportunities to:\n• make greater use of digital technologies to increase efficiency, encourage better information sharing and reduce\nrisk\n• improve contractual arrangements to encourage more innovation such as through greater use of collaborative\ncontracting, less focus on rigid specifications (and more on outputs) and greater use of performance incentives\n• simplify contractual processes through greater use of standardised contracts\n• improve the way risk is allocated, including for unexpected events\n• 'right-size' projects to encourage scope and scale efficiencies and encourage greater competition — this might\ninvolve bundling similar projects in some cases (for example, where it may be possible to encourage economies\nof scale or scope) and breaking up large contracts in other cases (for example, where this would encourage\ncompetition from smaller, innovative firms).\nThese issues have been raised in previous reviews and, at least to some extent, the Queensland Government\nalready has policies covering many of them. For example, the Queensland Government has guidance material on\ntwo-stage design and construct contracts, which is intended to facilitate more collaborative contracting.\nDespite this, stakeholders have advised the Commission that these policies are not being enacted in practice. It is\nnot clear why this is the case, and the Commission is seeking further evidence from stakeholders on what could be\ndone to improve contracting arrangements, including for example, if there are better incentive arrangements or\ncapabilities that need to be established within contracting agencies.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 128", "text_len": 3032, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

There is also a lack of publicly available information or other accountability mechanisms to\nincentivise local government performance.\n– Land use regulation constrains density, the supply of housing and leads to inefficient infrastructure\nuse. For example, almost 70 per cent of residential land in Brisbane within 1,000 metres of a train\nstation is effectively zoned as low density.\n• Because of this, development and housing construction costs are significantly higher than they should\nbe, with many developments becoming unfeasible, particularly affordable forms of housing.\n• While some reforms have been undertaken by government, more will be needed to increase land\nsupply and deliver the housing outcomes desired by the community.\n• To reduce the cost of construction, the Queensland Government should consider:\n– removing inconsistencies and ambiguities between planning and building regulation that have\nallowed regulatory creep in local planning schemes\n– increasing the consistency of local planning schemes across the state, by requiring regulation to be\nconsistent with the Queensland Development Code\n– allowing greater flexibility in the way local building regulations (such as height restrictions and\ngreen space provisions) are applied to allow some negotiation of outcomes between neighbours\nand developers.\n• To provide a more streamlined approvals system, the Queensland Government should consider:\n– introducing an alternative development assessment pathway for significant housing developments\n– modifying the roles for building certifiers and local government regulators to provide a more\nunified and consistent approvals system for smaller developments\n– simplifying approval requirements by developing consistent siting and design standards for houses\nand smaller attached housing developments\n• The Queensland Government should also increase the supply of development rights in identified, well\nlocated areas, by increasing the allowable densities in those areas.\n• Finally, regulators need to be held more accountable, including through the publication of data on\nlocal government performance outcomes.\n• While these reforms are likely to generate large benefits — zoning reforms alone could deliver net\nbenefits ranging from $18 - $48 billion — consideration needs to be given to increasing community\nsupport for reform, including by ensuring development benefits as many people as possible.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 131\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | Key points |  | \n |  | • Land use regulation seeks to reduce negative impacts arising from development, protect amenity, and |  | \n |  | coordinate the location and construction of infrastructure and public goods.

This causes idling of labour and capital and increases financing and administrative |  | \n |  | costs. There is also a lack of publicly available information or other accountability mechanisms to |  | \n |  | incentivise local government performance. |  | \n |  | – Land use regulation constrains density, the supply of housing and leads to inefficient infrastructure |  | \n |  | use. For example, almost 70 per cent of residential land in Brisbane within 1,000 metres of a train |  | \n |  | station is effectively zoned as low density. |  | \n |  | • Because of this, development and housing construction costs are significantly higher than they should |  | \n |  | be, with many developments becoming unfeasible, particularly affordable forms of housing. |  | \n |  | • While some reforms have been undertaken by government, more will be needed to increase land |  | \n |  | supply and deliver the housing outcomes desired by the community. |  | \n |  | • To reduce the cost of construction, the Queensland Government should consider: |  | \n |  | – removing inconsistencies and ambiguities between planning and building regulation that have |  | \n |  | allowed regulatory creep in local planning schemes |  | \n |  | – increasing the consistency of local planning schemes across the state, by requiring regulation to be |  | \n |  | consistent with the Queensland Development Code |  | \n |  | – allowing greater flexibility in the way local building regulations (such as height restrictions and |  | \n |  | green space provisions) are applied to allow some negotiation of outcomes between neighbours |  | \n |  | and developers. |  | \n |  | • To provide a more streamlined approvals system, the Queensland Government should consider: |  | \n |  | – introducing an alternative development assessment pathway for significant housing developments |  | \n |  | – modifying the roles for building certifiers and local government regulators to provide a more |  | \n |  | unified and consistent approvals system for smaller developments |  | \n |  | – simplifying approval requirements by developing consistent siting and design standards for houses |  | \n |  | and smaller attached housing developments |  | \n |  | • The Queensland Government should also increase the supply of development rights in identified, well |  | \n |  | located areas, by increasing the allowable densities in those areas. |  | \n |  | • Finally, regulators need to be held more accountable, including through the publication of data on |  | \n |  | local government performance outcomes. |  | \n |  | • While these reforms are likely to generate large benefits — zoning reforms alone could deliver net |  | \n |  | benefits ranging from $18 - $48 billion — consideration needs to be given to increasing community |  | \n |  | support for reform, including by ensuring development benefits as many people as possible. |  | ", "text_len": 8279, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

While measurement issues make it\ndifficult to quantify these effects, there are clear mechanisms through which land use regulation can impede\nproductivity. These include:\n• restrictions on housing density, such as minimum lot size, height restrictions and floor area ratios which impede\nthe achievement of scale economies\n• restrictions that limit the amount of developable land, which in turn, restrict development to locations that are\nmore expensive to build on, either because they require expensive new infrastructure or because they are less\nsuitable for construction\n• design conditions which may be unnecessary or inconsistent with building regulation requirements\n• regional variations that require different designs, uses of materials and construction processes across locations\n• approval processes that cause delays that result in resources being left idle or the inefficient sequencing of\nactivities\n• assessment processes that increase uncertainty\n• regulations that are unnecessarily complex or difficult to understand, requiring additional labour and specialised\nprofessional expertise (such as legal and urban planning)\n• regulations that inhibit innovation because they impede competition, scale economies, alternative design\nchoices and alternative construction or manufacturing methods.\nThe terms of reference direct the commission to give consideration of housing affordability, and productivity\nestimates in Chapter 2 suggest housing construction productivity performs much worse than other sub-industries.\nLand use regulation is likely to have a disproportionate impact on community welfare because it affects residential\nhousing supply.

Some appear to be very complex and difficult for non-experts and even many experts to\nnavigate — the planning scheme of Brisbane City Council (2023) alone is 2,526 pages.

Complexity also raises costs where it increases uncertainty about regulatory\noutcomes in advance of business decisions or increases the likelihood that mistakes will be made attempting to\ncomply with regulatory conditions. Unnecessary regulatory complexity is also likely to create barriers to entry and\nreduces competition.\nMuch of this complexity seems to reflect inconsistencies between the Planning\nAct and the Building Act\nSeveral stakeholders have noted there are significant inconsistencies between the Building Act 1975 (the Building\nAct) and the Planning Act, that create overlap and duplication, making it unclear who is responsible for setting and\ninterpreting standards for building design.\nThe interface between Queensland’s planning and building frameworks is a source of delay and\nconfusion, contributing to inefficiencies and uncertainty that ultimately affect housing delivery and\nconstruction productivity. (Planning Institute of Australia, sub. 13, p. 3)\nThere is no definitive delineation between the matters regulated under the Planning Act 2016 and\nthe Building Act 1975, which has resulted in duplication and, in some cases, conflicting\nrequirements. This can create legal and practical impossibilities for proponents and assessment\nmanagers seeking to comply with both regimes ... Critical terms such as \"building work\" are defined\ndifferently across the two frameworks, creating interpretive uncertainty. The absence of a conflict\nresolution hierarchy between the Acts further exacerbates this issue. (Master Builders Queensland,\nsub. 43, p. 22)\nThe current framework is riddled with confusion requiring complex and headache inducing zig zag\nreading between 2 legislative branches which contain multiple conflicting and similar definitions\nand numerous other subordinate documents which differ from region to region and this is only to\ndetermine the Type of Development, Category of Development and who the assessment\nmanager/s be for that development proposal. (Erin Dunn, sub. 64, p. 1)\nStatutory building surveying roles are made more complex by requiring that all necessary planning\napplications are obtained and consistent with the proposed building works. The Legislation seeks\nto separate jurisdiction between building and planning matters through Planning Act Section 8.\nHowever, planning and building have vastly different requirements, and it can be said that the\nnational decline of building regulatory systems is in part due to State and Territory decisions to\nplace regulatory control with planning departments. (Australian Institute of Building Surveyors,\nsub. 49, p. 6-7)\nThe Queensland Development Code (QDC) provides design and siting standards for building in Queensland, which\nmostly reflect the National Construction Code (NCC) and bring Queensland specific building codes into a single\ndocument. However, local planning schemes may vary state design and siting standards in the QDC, with most\ncouncils choosing to apply their own variations.\nWhile the QDC and the draft housing provisions provide consistent assessment benchmarks for\nhousing across the state, the current legislation allows each local government to vary these\nbenchmarks locally. (Project BA, sub. 48, p. 3)\nThe outworking of this, is that there is a plethora of requirements in planning schemes which significantly increase\nconstruction costs.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 138", "text_len": 3684, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

As a result, it is difficult to assess the efficacy of requirements in local planning schemes.\nStakeholders pointed to a wide variety of restrictions introduced into local planning schemes. For example:\nCouncil policies on height limits, lot minimums and character protections in residential zoning all\nseverely limit the developable land to a handful of large sites, particularly in the inner city where\ntransport access is barely relevant for access to employment. In fact, character restrictions apply\nto nearly 13% of all of Brisbane’s residential zoned land, and the majority of residential lots in the\nhighly desirable neighbourhoods within 5 kilometres of the CBD.\nCombined with Brisbane City Council’s reactionary 2017 “townhouse ban”, Council’s decisions\nhave put a squeeze on innovative mid-sized firms who would in a functioning market be\ndeveloping luxury mid-rise apartments in highly-desirable areas. (Greater Brisbane, sub. 11, p. 2)\nlocal governments should not create blanket overlays to capture majority of (or every) site for the\nregulation of certain aspects of development. For example, the Brisbane City Council’s Dwelling\nhouse character overlay, Sunshine Coast Regional Council’s Height of buildings and structures\noverlay. In both these examples, the overlays were created to circumnavigate legislative provisions\nintended to simplify or cut red tape (Project BA, sub 48, p. 16)\nApart from stakeholder views, there is considerable evidence to suggest that many additional regulatory\nrequirements in local and state planning schemes (including Priority Development Areas) are problematic. For\nexample:\n• Minimum parking regulations that impose unnecessary costs on households. Recent research surveying\napartment residents in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth found parking is often misallocated, with around 20 per\ncent of apartments oversupplied and 14 per cent undersupplied (De Gruyter et al. 2023). As each parking space\nis worth up to $100,000, the price of unused parking was estimated to cost residents more than $6 billion\n(Zheng 2023). De Gruyter et al. (2023) noted this was an inefficient use of space and exacerbated housing\naffordability issues.\n• While heritage regulations are important to protect buildings of historic and cultural significance, they can be\ncomplex and legalistic and provide an inefficient mechanism to protect heritage values. Because private owners\ntypically do not capture the wider community benefits of conservation, this typically creates disincentives for\nowners to fully maintain heritage properties, with many falling into disrepair (PC 2006). Protections can also risk\nworkplace health and safety and broader public health, by delaying or impeding maintenance and repair and\npreventing the timely removal of derelict buildings and hazardous materials.\n• Character zoning is unique to Brisbane and requires the retention of pre-1947 homes, and imposes a range of\nother conditions, including limiting development to two storeys, requirements that additional buildings must be\nbehind or beside an existing dwelling and limited to no more than one dwelling per 300m2 and must reflect the\nexisting character of the area (BCC 2023). These requirements impose significant additional costs with unclear\nbenefits.\n• Mandatory inclusionary zoning requires developers to include a proportion of properties in a development\nthat are below market rate. The Australian Productivity Commission (2022) found that mandatory inclusionary\nzoning can add additional costs, potentially reducing supply and worsening affordability.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 139", "text_len": 3975, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Research has found planning restrictions\ndesigned to protect Brisbane’s backyard and character have not prevented a loss of greenspace (Gallagher et al.\n2020a) or preserved heritage buildings (Gallagher et al. 2023) but may have encouraged urban sprawl (Gallagher\net al. 2020b).\nRoles and responsibilities are unclear, creating yet more cost\nApart from the additional (and varying) local government requirements, conflicts between the building and\nplanning acts create confusion about the roles and responsibilities of different actors in the system. As noted by\nthe Housing Industry Association (HIA) (sub. 32, p. 7):\nThere are a significant number of ‘grey’ areas in both planning and building legislation which are\napplied by councils, planning consultants and building certifiers differently.\nStakeholders told us this causes confusion and can result in inefficient staging of approvals.\nPlanning matters are addressed in isolation, with no regard for building compliance issues. By the\ntime the proposal reaches a Building Certifier for assessment under the Building Act, substantial\ninvestment may already have been made in architectural design, engineering, and surveying—\nonly to discover fundamental non-compliances, such as insufficient fire separation due to\nboundary proximity or inadequate stormwater management stemming from incompatible roof\ndrainage design. These disconnects highlight the inefficiencies and risks caused by complex\nassessment pathways. (Erin Dunn, sub. 64, pp. 1-2)\nMembers are reporting that they are utilising 80% of their time during the construction\nauthorisation assessment stage in resolving planning matters, leaving limited time to carry out\ntheir key role in assessing building design compliance. This leads to decisions conditioning\ncompliance, and leaving it up to trades to sort out how compliance is to be achieved during\nconstruction, rather than it being demonstrated in the design phase.\n(Australian Institute of Building Surveyors sub. 49, p. 7)\nThis confusion increases the chances of costly defects, undermines building design and increases the costs of\ndevelopment. As noted by Project BA (sub. 48, p. 4):\nThis ability to create local government housing provisions becomes complicated for the entire\nconstruction sector, where they are not experienced with the specific nuances with that area. The\noutcome of this is:\n- a burden on those in the design team in understanding site constraints, modifying building plans,\nand back and forth with non-compliances that were missed initially.\n- a burden on certification teams to understand site constraints and required approvals for non-\ncompliances, back and forth with local governments about local processes in development\npathways for identified non-compliances, back and forth with design teams to remedy any\nbreaches.\n- Degradation of well-designed building layouts which have been optimized for functionality,\nefficiency, materials and construction methodologies.\nAs a result, people tell us they are ready to leave the market altogether:\nThe uncertainty means I would never do another development in Brisbane despite my extensive\nexperience in the building industry over more than 40 years.

As noted by the Australian Institute of Building Surveyors\n(sub. 49, p. 4):\nThe legislative arrangements in Queensland related to the establishment of technical\ninfrastructure means that local government is able to choose if it will adopt State overlays and in\nso doing creates further complexity regarding the technical infrastructure that is applicable on a\ncouncil by council basis. There is also an ability for local government to vary elements of the\nQueensland Development Codes that are applicable within each council area, effectively creating\na fourth tier of technical infrastructure to be observed in any development activity.\nWhile some variation may be beneficial as a response to local conditions, unnecessary variation in regulation\nacross the state diminishes standardisation, increases compliance costs and limits opportunities for scale\neconomies and innovation (including modular construction methods).\nAs many builders or developers work across multiple local government areas, it often discourages\nthese businesses developing streamlined or more efficient systems as they need to remain tailored\nfor each council. (HIA, sub. 32, p. 11)\nMoreover, there are substantial regulatory variations between different state jurisdictions around\ninfrastructure projects, including those that are linked to housing delivery. This creates additional\ncomplications for contractors that work across more than one local government area or different\nlevels of government. When a contractor must learn a whole new set of rules, regulations, and\nspecifications to be able to expand into a jurisdiction that might be literally just across the street –\nit becomes significantly more difficult for the business to grow beyond their original local\ngovernment area. (Civil Contractors Federation, pers. comm.)\nZoning types also vary across local government areas. While local governments may use the same zones in most\ninstances, each council determines which uses are allowed in each zone, reducing actual standardisation (PC 2021,\np. 12). Local governments also introduce bespoke zoning. For example, while Logan City Council has 15 zoning\ntypes used in its plan, Brisbane City Council has 75 (BCC 2023; Logan City Council 2025).\nEnvironmental regulations are inconsistently applied\nEnvironmental regulations were also raised by stakeholders. While issues were raised about environmental\napprovals, particularly interplays between the Environment Protection and Diversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC\nAct), which is administered by the Australian Government, and state and local government regulation, it is beyond\nthe scope of this inquiry to consider the design of this regulation. Nevertheless, issues with environmental\napprovals are discussed in the next section.\nThere are, however, matters within the Queensland Government's sphere of control.\nFor example, several stakeholders raised concerns about a lack of consistency across the state regarding the\ndesignation and implementation of environmental overlays — particularly for flooding and bushfire risk. For\nexample, the HIA (sub. 32, p. 8) notes:\nThere is no need for regional issues such as bushfire, flooding and environmental management to\nhave unique requirements in all 77 council planning schemes.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 141", "text_len": 3632, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The Commission’s preliminary view\nis that the Planning Act should provide strict limits on what building matters can be regulated through Planning\nlegislation.\nThis is consistent with the position of Project BA (sub. 48, p. 16) who suggests amendments are required to clarify\nwhat is \"a provision about building work\" as referred to in section 8 of the Planning Act. Project BA contends that\nthis amendment should clearly define what can and cannot be regulated by local government instruments,\nincluding for example:\n• Removal of rights to regulate building matters, such as bushfire or flood hazard building matters, that are\ncovered by the NCC and/or QDC\n• Removal of rights to create blanket overlays, such as blanket character overlays or blanket height overlays\n• Other matters unrelated to the general use of the dwelling.\nStakeholders advocated for an independent review of the interface between the Planning Act and the Building Act,\nwith the objective of resolving areas of friction, removing regulatory overlap and reducing unnecessary or\ninefficient regulation made through government planning schemes.\nMost stakeholders thought this review should be conducted by a suitably qualified, independent body with legal\nand planning expertise.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 142", "text_len": 3220, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

These variations should be consistent with\ngood design principles including that regulation should be proportionate to risk and avoid being unnecessarily\nprescriptive.\nThe QDC should consider the benefits and costs of variations from a state-wide perspective (rather than merely\nlocal benefits), including their impact on construction productivity and housing affordability. Including these\nvariations in the QDC itself, rather than at the discretion of individual local governments, would help ensure that\nthey are well designed, deliver state-wide net benefits and allow them to be standardised across regions facing\nsimilar conditions.\nThe Queensland Law Society (sub. 63, p. 5) suggests that guidelines or standard provisions could be used to\nstreamline or limit provisions that could be adopted under a planning scheme or local law.\nCurrently, there is very little consistency across planning schemes and their provisions are often\ndifficult to interpret and apply. Therefore, we recommend introducing guidelines, examples or\nstandard provisions that clearly demonstrate how alternative provisions and other provisions that\nmay be adopted under a planning scheme, local law or resolution are to be drafted and operate.\nStandardisation of zoning types across the state should also be considered.

Both local governments (Local Government Association of Queensland, sub. 14, p. 2) and\nconstruction industry stakeholders have raised infrastructure charges as an issue that impacts construction\nproductivity and housing development. For example, the HIA (sub. 32, p. 10) argues:\nPressure on public funds has now resulted in a user-pays model which means infrastructure costs\nare embedded in the price of a house and land package.\nIf infrastructure charges are too low, this may act as a disincentive for local governments to allow development and\nprovide infrastructure. Conversely, if they are too high, they may be a disincentive for developers.29\nThe Henry tax review argued that poorly targeted infrastructure charges can impose a range of unintended\ndistortions on housing markets, saying ‘simple flat prices that do not well approximate actual avoidable costs can\nreduce housing supply’ (Henry et al. 2010, p. 426). For example, higher density developments may face higher\nprices for infrastructure than the actual marginal cost attributable to the development.\nConcerns about when and how infrastructure charges are levied are also common. For example, stakeholders have\nraised concerns that project viability may be impacted by the timing of charges or whether infrastructure\ncontributed during the development process are counted as credits against future charges.\nThe Australian Productivity Commission (2004, p. 177) has provided some best practice principles for ensuring\ninfrastructure charges are efficient and equitable and do not dissuade new housing construction:\n• necessary — with the need for the services concerned being clearly demonstrated\n• efficient — justified on a whole-of-life cost basis and consistent with maintaining financial disciplines on service\nproviders by precluding over-recovery of costs\n• equitable — with a clear nexus between benefits and costs and only implemented after industry and public\ninput.\nImplementing these principles into a fair and efficient charging regime is not a simple task, as there is a range of\ncompeting interests. Other jurisdictions have required independent reviews to assess these views and determine\nhow infrastructure charging should occur. For example, the then New South Wales (NSW) Productivity Commission\n(2020) completed an 8-month review before handing down its final recommendations on infrastructure charging.\nThere appears to be a strong case for conducting a similar review in Queensland. Submissions to this inquiry have\ncalled for reform or an independent review of infrastructure charging (for example see HIA, sub. 32, p. 10; Local\nGovernment Association of Queensland sub. 14, p. 2).\n29 First best policy would focus on ensuring that infrastructure charges reflect the cost of provision as this will help ensure\nefficient allocation of development. Second best policy might acknowledge that land use policy restricts development rights,\nand infrastructure incentive payments may be required to incentivise local governments.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 144", "text_len": 3235, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Often only a small part is time spent\nbuilding. Even after approvals are granted, delays can continue as projects seek construction\ncertificates and wait for essential infrastructure connections. Because construction is highly\nsequential, delays and disruptions can create ‘cascading failures’, which push up costs. (PC 2025a,\np.4)\nSimilarly, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (2022) described the development process as\noften being long and cumbersome.\nWhile there is little publicly available data on approval times, stakeholders told us that approval processes were\nunnecessarily long, cumbersome to navigate, inherently uncertain and lacked accountability. While many of the\ncase studies provided to the Commission were confidential, John Tozer (sub. 18, p. 2) provides a useful example\nwhere confusing back and forth approval processes, created excessive delays and resulted in significantly higher\nproject costs:\n… Council changes its mind yet again and now wants and approves all Council trees being removed\nfrom verge and insists on construction of footpath at road level. Which is essentially exactly the\nsame as was approved when subdivision commenced in April 2022, which they refused to allow us\nto construct for more than two years. Possibly the first time in history a Developer has proposed\nto save some Council trees but Council has insisted the Developer knocks them all down … Delays\nhave cost Owners hundreds of thousands of dollars in extra construction and financing costs as\nwell as approximately an extra $100,000 each in costs to 2 buyers of Lots, from Builders raising\ntheir quotes, by waiting up to 18 months extra for Council to make up its mind about the verge\nand issue Plan Sealing.\nSimilar sentiments were provided by other developers. For example, Camalee Investments (sub. 12, p. 1) contends\nthat approval processes have become so convoluted it is impossible to construct housing that is affordable:\nHere are the minimum number of different entities and hurdles we need to coordinate / engage /\njump over to get approvals & complete from the initial design to completion of the 6 townhouses.\nThese are all separate steps that generally require independent approvals before you can proceed\nto the next step and any one of these steps can bring the whole project to a stop. Some approvals\ntake 3 weeks, some take 6 to 9 months and that's per line item, some can go concurrently but most\nneed one step done before the next can start. They all lead to increased uncertainty in delivering\na project in a reasonable timeframe.\nApproval processes seem particularly problematic for multi-dwelling developments. Developers have asserted that\ntownhouses in Brisbane require more than 30 approvals from council and statutory bodies while houses require\nthree (Ludlow 2023). Townhouse approval processes appear to be much more complex than detached houses and\ntake much longer. The Housing Industry Association (HIA) (sub. 32, p. 5) submitted that:\n… in 2014 Brisbane’s new planning scheme introduced 22 additional requirements for townhouses\nand apartments.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 148", "text_len": 3791, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For example, most (56 per cent) planning matters that proceed to court involve a developer appealing a\ncouncil refusal (DSDILGP 2021). Most appeals are successful30, and the development is allowed. The proportion of\nplanning applications that result in appeals varies significantly across councils.31 This suggests that there is\nsignificant variation in the approval processes across councils, with many not operating as well as they should.32\nThese inconsistencies in the interpretation of planning legislation at the local government level can result in\nsignificant delays. For example:\nProject BA was required to engage in an almost 2 year Court proceeding to confirm and enforce a\nprocess that was already prescribed by sections 54(3) and 60(4) of the Planning Act. (Project BA,\nsub. 48, p. 8)\nEven in priority development areas, where approvals are supposed to be streamlined, approval processes can\ncause excessive delays. For example, a 2019 Moreton Bay application for a higher density mixed use development\nnext to a train station on a vacant site faced approval delays, because of a state assessment that it would cause\ntraffic issues on a state road, despite council support and approval and being in a Priority Development Area, the\nsite now hosts 'a forest of weeds', a dilapidated building and ‘unsightly’ fencing and neighbours are concerned\nabout vandals (Callinan 2024).\nPoor planning performance does not appear to be universal. For example, SARA, which is involved in assessing\ndevelopment applications that affect a state interest, appears to perform well. It adopts annual key performance\nindicators that include time to issue information requests and make assessments, proportion of decisions appealed\nand levels of customer satisfaction (with 79 per cent of customers satisfied with overall performance and 75 per\ncent with the pre-lodgement process in 2021-22) (Queensland Government 2022b).\nSimilar local government information is generally not publicly available in Queensland. However, the Commission\nunderstand that Queensland has the longest statutory timeframes for approval and many stakeholders provided\nexamples of long delays from extended local government approval timeframes.\nResearch has tended to show that local authorities tend to be more restrictive than higher level governments and\nare more responsive to obstructive stakeholders (Glaeser & Gyourko 2018; Hilber & Rober-Nicoud 2013). The\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) research estimated that Australia has the most\ndecentralised land use regulatory system across 25 developed countries (Cavalleri et al. 2019). Within Australia,\nQueensland appears to have a relatively more decentralised planning system than other Australian states and\nterritories.\n30 55 per cent of all appealed developments are allowed to proceed and 7 per cent are partially allowed.\n31 The proportion of planning applications that result in appeals varies significantly across councils from about 0 per cent in\nFraser Coast, Lockyer Valley and Mackay to 4 per cent in Redland and Brisbane and 5 per cent in Noosa\n32 A high rate of appeals, with a high rate of success, would imply that local government regulators are not applying or\ninterpreting regulations in line with their intent. It is likely that in those councils with high rates of appeals, the cost and\nuncertainty associated with approval processes would discourage applicants.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 149", "text_len": 3618, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

They estimate that current approvals for quarries take between 1 to 14\nyears and cost between $800,000 and $8,000,000:\n… over the recent period, six million tonnes of quarry production within KRA’s has been denied\nwith DA assessment processes extending beyond five years and costing Applicants and Councils\nmany millions of dollars. This has resulted in a reduction in confidence from the quarrying industry\nto invest in new and expanded quarries in Queensland. (Cement Concrete & Aggregates Australia,\nsub. 5, p. 10)\nInfrequent complex approvals for projects also impose high costs on councils. A local council may also not be best\nplaced to assess some projects of state interest, that provide wider benefits but impose costs locally.\nPrevious reviews have also observed planning problems impeding other industries. For example, inquiries\nreviewing the retail industry, have identified planning processes as impeding competition, including development\nassessment and approvals and appeals within the process (Harper et al. 2015; ACCC 2008, 2025; PC 2011a).\nStakeholders told us that community projects were also often subject to lengthy and complex approval processes.\nLocal and state government approvals are often difficult to navigate for other parts of governments and these\ncosts can be particularly adverse for smaller projects.\nWe are seeking more evidence about problems in relation to non-residential markets, which industries are most\nimpacted and how impediments materialise.\nEnvironmental approvals\nStakeholders also raised concerns that the Federal Government imposes duplicative environmental protections\nadding red tape costs and significant additional time in the total approval process.

It is not uncommon to secure local and state government approval for vegetation\nclearing only to be subject to a 2 – 4 year process with the Federal Government to determine if\nvegetation clearing is supported under the EPBC Act.

Some stakeholders recommended that the Commonwealth vacate this area. While this would remove the\nlayer of duplication at least temporarily, it may give rise to further regulatory fragmentation between jurisdictions.\nWhile it is beyond the scope of this inquiry to review environmental regulation and the interplay between federal\nand state legislation, the Commission is seeking stakeholder suggestions for relatively simple, effective options to\nhelp streamline environmental approvals.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 150", "text_len": 3511, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

(Queensland Law Society, sub. 63, p. 6)\nSome stakeholders have suggested that the role of building certifiers could be clarified such that they effectively\noperate as gateways for approval processes. For example, Erin Dunn (sub. 64, p. 2) suggests that all development\napplications involving building work should be first submitted to a private building certifier as the initial gateway,\nwith the certifier effectively coordinating the approval process.\nThis view is supported by the Australian Institute of Building Surveyors (sub. 49, p. 5) who suggest that building\ncertifiers should be the prescribed assessment manager for residential houses:\nFor assessable development (developments that require an authorisation before construction can\ncommence) involving a dwelling house (residence) and/or ancillary outbuildings (sheds, carports,\ngarages etc.) on residential land, regulations should be amended so that the appointed building\ncertifier should be the prescribed assessment manager. In this case, the local government role\nshould be limited to being a referral agency for any proposed non-compliance/s with town\nplanning instruments.\nThey note this would simplify the development process because this would mean that only a single development\napplication would be required, and it would clarify roles and responsibilities (certifier as the prescribed assessment\nmanager, councils as a referral agency) and provide a mechanism for preventing duplication and allow faster\nturnaround times.\nAny move to redefine the role of the building certifier as the prescribed assessment manager is likely to require\namendment to the Planning Act.\nThe New Zealand Government recently enabled the establishment of a private building approval company,\nBuilding Consent Approvals (BCA), to speed up approvals. The company is focusing on simpler approvals but aims\nto turn around low-risk developments much faster than local governments.

As\nnoted earlier (and in Box 9.1 below), the evidence suggests the use of mandated housing affordability provisions is\nlikely to result in fewer houses being built, reducing overall housing affordability.\nBox 9.1 Affordable housing provisions\nAffordable housing provision is not free. Where it is imposed mandatorily, the Australia Productivity\nCommission (2022) says it can add costs, reduce supply and worsen affordability.\nVoluntary affordable housing provisions — whether through streamlined development assessment\npathways or additional development rights — rely on windfall gains from avoiding regulatory costs or\nreceiving scarce rights. Reducing these regulatory barriers for some projects (but not most) may not\ndepress housing supply and affordability broadly. However, they also are unlikely to make a large impact\non the overall housing market.\nThe number of affordable housing units that are likely to be built from affordable housing mandates is\ngenerally small because the internal economics of developments can support only so many affordable\nunits and the number of projects in any year is not that high.\nSeveral states have affordable housing provisions in their planning systems. One analysis found that 2500\naffordable dwellings had been developed through the NSW Government’s inclusionary zoning regime\nbetween 2009-10 and 2020-21. South Australia delivered 5,485 affordable homes between 2005–15\nthrough an inclusionary planning target applying to new residential areas.\nLi and Guo (2021) found that when the affordable housing requirement across London was expanded\nfrom projects with 15 or more units to those with 10 or more units, there was a decline in new\ndevelopments of 10-14 units, and an increase in developments with 9 or fewer units (that is, where\npossible developers will divert their resources).\nInternational evidence suggests inclusionary zoning can act as a de facto development tax and increase\nprices and/or lower the overall supply of dwellings, worsening overall affordability.\nAffordable housing provisions in planning are likely, at best, to modestly benefit some lower income\nhouseholds and at worst, if poorly designed, constrain housing supply with attendant consequences for\naffordability.\nSources: Metcalf 2018, p. 20; Gurran et al. 2018; Gurran et al. 2021; Li & Guo 2021; Hamilton 2021; Mukhija et al. 2015; Rowley et al. 2022,\np. 57; Schuetz et al. 2011.\nProviding an alternative streamlined planning pathway may lead to more efficient and timely processing of\nplanning applications by removing roadblocks, allowing greater expertise and resourcing to be utilised, and\napplying a state mandate to support new housing where it is needed.\nIn designing a new development pathway, consideration needs to be given to both what thresholds (if any) should\napply before an alternative process can be enacted, and which body should be given responsibility for processing\ndevelopment applications under this centralised process.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 152\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | Box 9.1 Affordable housing provisions |  | \n |  | Affordable housing provision is not free.

{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 155, "text": "Approval processes\nOne option for enacting an alternative assessment pathway is to provide additional responsibilities to a state\ngovernment body such as SARA. SARA already provides an end-to-end service for developments that trigger a\n‘state interest’ threshold. It has a good reputation – the Property Council of Australia (2017, p. 8,15) has referred to\nit as a model for state referral services and the Australian Productivity Commission (2025a, p. 6) recently suggested\nthat it provides a starting point for other states to look to when implementing reforms that establish coordination\nbodies.\nAlternatively, consideration could be given to using an independent assessment pathway. For example, Western\nAustralia allows developers to opt into a process whereby dwelling developments can be determined by an\nindependent 'development assessment panel' (WA Government 2024a). These panels comprise two local\ngovernment members and three specialist, subject matter expert members appointed by government. The panels\nprovide a streamlined approval process for multiple home developments over $2 million.\nThe Commission is seeking stakeholders' views on the criteria for assessing whether a housing development is\nsufficiently significant to qualify for an alternative development assessment pathway, and the format of the\nproposed body for streamlining development assessments.\nRemove approval requirements for simple or standardised designs\nDevelopment approvals are not required in Queensland where a proposed development falls into an accepted\ndevelopment category. These proposals are low risk and compatible with planning intentions in an area. Each local\ngovernment sets their own rules for what are accepted developments.\nIn Brisbane, for example, houses and granny flats mostly do not require development assessment, unless there are\nother overlays such as character matters requiring further assessment. Multiple dwelling proposals generally\nrequire assessment — either code assessment (where the application meets local scheme assessment benchmarks\nand does not require public consultation) or impact assessment (where they do not meet relevant benchmarks and\npublic consultation occurs).\nStakeholders indicated that there is often a lack of clarity over the correct planning processes and which\ndevelopments are impact assessable. This often results in drawn out approvals and legal disputes.\nThe local government contended that the wrong type of application had been lodged, … as the site\nwas within a Mixed Use Zone, the proposal was categorised by the local planning scheme as\nmaterial change of use … requiring impact assessment. … The matter was not determined by the\nCourt because the local government (despite having in-house counsel), sought external legal\nadvice and ultimately agreed [with the procedural position] Project BA contended. (Project BA, Sub.\n48, p. 10)\nThe HIA (sub. 32, p. 12) also pointed to procedural delays that do not have clear rationale:\nMany council plumbing departments will refuse to issue a plumbing approval for a new house\nuntil an allotment has been registered. As there is often a long delay between planning approval,\ninfrastructure construction and final title registration, this means that builders can be\nunnecessarily waiting months for lots to be registered with the titles office prior to commencing\nconstruction.\nTo address these issues, some jurisdictions have introduced pre-approval processes or explicitly removed the need\nfor approval. For example:\n• The Victorian Government has exempted small second dwellings from requiring a planning permit in most\nresidential and rural zones if specified requirements are met. It has also removed the need for a planning permit\nfor a single dwelling on a lot of 300 square metres or more (Victorian Government 2025).\n• NSW is developing a Housing Pattern Book of designs and guidelines to support the construction of housing\nincluding terrace houses, dual occupancy homes, low-rise and mid-rise apartments (NSW Government n.d.). The\nproposed Distinctly Queensland Design Series takes a similar approach (Queensland Government 2024b).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 153", "text_len": 4174, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 156, "text": "Approval processes\n• The Tasmanian Government recently announced that plumbing services are 'deemed to comply' if they meet\nspecified requirements and constitute a low level of risk (Tasmanian Government 2025).\nThere seems to be a strong case for implementing similar processes in Queensland for activities that are deemed\nlow risk. This would have the advantage of simplifying the process for proponents and also reducing burden on\nlocal government planning departments.\nThe Queensland Government has committed to the development of a Queensland Housing Code, which would\nprovide standardised siting and design standards for single detached dwellings (houses on single blocks). While\nthis initiative will simplify planning and approval processes, consideration should be given to whether this could be\nextended to include smaller multi-unit developments.\nThe Commission is interested in stakeholders' views on other pre-approval processes or opportunities for\nremoving approval for standard processes or designs and in what circumstances this would be most appropriate.\nReviewing the Building and Planning Acts to ensure statutory\ntimeframes are adequate\nStakeholders said that timeframes for building and planning approvals are not always adequate and can at times\nconflict with each other. Approvals lapsing due to time limits on statutory timeframes can result in the need to\nreapply for approvals and further project delays:\nThe building act prescribes a demolition/removal condition which prescribes that works must\nsubstantially commence within 2 months or the application lapses. In many cases, this creates a\nsignificant burden in the re-issue of development permits, as other permits such as road traffic\npermits, after hours works permits, etc are also required, can’t be lodged until after a building\napproval for the works is obtained, and generally take more than 2 months to process, leading the\nbuilding approval lapsing. (Project BA, sub. 48, p. 18)\nStakeholders also explained that timeframes can unexpectedly increase for a range of reasons:\nThe timeframes for design and approval of developments are often also drawn out because of the\ncomplexity of technical infrastructure. Those involved in design will make best endeavours to\ndetermine what is required and design accordingly, only to find that something has been missed\nforcing redesign of elements to address deficiencies arising from that process. The processing of\napplications is also often protracted beyond expected timeframes because of unforeseen referral\nprocesses and also because of issues that arise therein which were not anticipated because of the\ndifficulty in understanding what is required up front. (Australian Institute of Building Surveyors,\nsub. 49, p. 5)\nAs such, there appears to be a need to review statutory timeframes to ensure they are adequate and do not result\nin approvals conflicting or unnecessarily lapsing.\nUse technology to improve planning processes\nTechnology can also be used to facilitate improved performance. For example, stakeholders have said there is the\npotential to:\n• use a single digital statewide portal for providing planning information and making planning applications\n• use artificial intelligence to speed up the development assessment process and provide concierge services.\nStakeholders provided some examples of the potential for technologies to improve the efficiency, accuracy and\ntransparency of planning processes (for example, Association of Consulting Architects, sub. 15, p. 3) and greater\nuse of electronic forms (Project BA, sub. 48, p. 17).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 154", "text_len": 3621, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

As result, the NSW Government\nextracts data from their online planning portal to produce council performance data (NSW Government 2025a).\nThe Commission is seeking further information on how designs (particularly for apartments and townhouses) or\nservices could be given pre-approval or the need for approval removed.\nImprove information on process timeframes and outcomes\nCurrently, there is no process for holistically monitoring or reporting development approval or assessment\ntimeframes and outcomes in Queensland. The absence of performance information on planning and development\napprovals is likely to reduce accountability and weaken incentives for improvement, particularly for local\ngovernments.\nImproving the availability of information on the performance of local governments in managing their planning and\ndevelopment obligations would:\n• provide greater visibility of local government performance, strengthening incentives to improve regulatory\nperformance\n• provide guidance to builders and developers on the regulatory effectiveness and efficiency of local governments\n• allow the setting of performance benchmarks.\nIn NSW, a Council League Table is publicly available with monthly details on several key planning performance\nmetrics for each local government council. Metrics are also compared against benchmarks detailed in a Statement\nof Expectations Order issued each year (NSW Government 2025b).\nImproving the public availability of local government data on planning performance appear meritorious, given the\npotential benefits and the present lack of such data. However, data collection, compilation and dissemination come\nat a cost that needs to be compared with the benefits.\nThe costs of data collection could be minimised if (as is the case of NSW) development approvals were lodged\nthrough a central planning portal, rather than with local governments.\nThe Commission is seeking stakeholder views on what performance information would be useful to collect and\nmake public, and whether the benefits are likely to exceed the costs.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 155", "text_len": 2907, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

SGS Economics & Planning (2016) identified a clear inverse\nrelationship between housing density and infrastructure costs.\nApart from the productivity enhancing effects of more efficient land use, higher density is likely to improve\naffordability and has also been shown to provide a range of other benefits, including reduced congestion,\nimproved liveability and better health and environmental outcomes (Box 10.1).\nImprovements to productivity would come through a reduction in transport times between homes\nand workplaces and an increase in ‘agglomeration benefits’ (i.e. self-reinforcing growth where\nmore jobs attract more workers; productive firms attract other productive firms; specialist firms,\nindustries and professionals congregate). More flexible residential planning that allows for greater\ndensity would also be highly likely to significantly reduce costs for building new homes.\n(Menzies Research Centre, sub. 35, p. 5)\nIt is not clear that the current patterns of urban land use (which are strongly influenced by land use regulation)\nreflect community preferences. While there is limited Queensland data about the types of housing many people\nwould prefer to live in, numerous studies have shown that planned and actual housing supply often does not\nmatch people’s preferences. While housing is disproportionately provided as detached houses on the city fringe,\nAustralian studies show people would prefer to live in more central locations and taking into account budget\nconstraints, at greater densities (Daley et al. 2018; Kelly et al. 2011; Newton et al. 2022; Curtin Business School &\nHames Sharley 2013; Infrastructure Victoria 2023).\nLand located close to services and amenities is in short supply.

This is largely the result of restrictive zoning,\nincluding the low density residential and character zoning that exists across much of inner and middle Brisbane.\nFigure 10.1 Zoning in Brisbane City Council\nSource: QPC analysis of Train Station and Brisbane City Council Zoning data.\nNote: Character 1 and 2 which allows low density housing is included with low density.

For example, almost 80 per cent and almost 50 per cent of land within 1,000 metres of the\ntrain stations for Noosa and Sunshine Coast, respectively, is zoned as rural or rural residential.\n• At least a third and up to three-quarters of residential areas in each local government area (except for Moreton\nBay) is preserved through rural residential zoning for extremely low-density residential development.\nStakeholders told us that even where land is zoned for higher density it is often in locations where there is little\ndemand for that type of housing.\nMost council planning schemes continue to assume apartments will be built in locations not\ndesirable to the market. Some examples include land adjacent to Capalaba Shopping Centre\n(Redland City Council) and land adjacent to the Park Ridge Shopping Centre and Mount Lindesay\nHighway (Logan City Council)\nPlanning schemes for regional parts of Queensland (Cairns, Townsville and Gympie) also zone\nproperties for apartment construction despite apartments never being built at a considerable scale\nin these locations. (Housing Industry Association, sub. 32, p. 6)\nThis means that planning schemes need to reflect market realities.

The more tightly controlled\nland releases (or upzoning) are the more consideration that needs to be given to market sounding.33\n10.2 Reform is likely to deliver large benefits\nGiven the benefits of higher density, current restrictions on the use of land in SEQ is likely to impose significant\ncosts on the community.\nTo demonstrate the potential benefits of planning reforms, the Commission has developed a stylised cost-benefit\nanalysis (CBA). The CBA considers the effect of increasing development rights in SEQ. The analysis does not\nconsider other supply constraints and assumes increased development rights translates into more housing supply\nand greater density in higher demand locations. This analysis draws on evidence from the outcomes of planning\nreforms undertaken in other jurisdictions.\nAs such, the modelling is not intended to provide a forecast or projection of future dwelling supply. Rather it\nprovides an estimate of the potential benefits that could be achieved through planning reforms that increase\ndevelopment rights.\nThe results suggest that reforms which result in greater housing supply and densities in desirable locations have\nthe potential to deliver very large benefits to the Queensland community:\n• Targeted zoning reforms in well located areas, including around transport networks in SEQ is projected to\ndeliver up to 330,000 additional dwellings, reduce dwelling price growth by up to 64 per cent (relative to the\nbase case) and deliver net benefits up to $48 billion.\n• Dispersed zoning reforms to provide more development opportunities both in infill areas and on the urban\nfringe, are projected to deliver more dwellings (up to 330,000), reduce dwelling price growth by up to 56 per\ncent (relative to the base case) and net benefits of up to $18 billion.\n33 For example, broad upzoning, as occurred in Auckland, allows the market to determine where development should occur.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 162", "text_len": 3648, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For example, ShapingSEQ, which\noutlines the Queensland Government's long-term plan for urban growth, envisages upwards of 60 per cent of all\nnew housing to be consolidated in existing urban areas, requiring more apartments, units and townhouses\n(Queensland Government 2023b).

Local governments are delegated control of most of the levers that influence\nboth the nature of development and where it occurs. However, because the costs of development are likely to be\nconcentrated locally (with impacts on existing residents, networks and infrastructure) and the benefits are\ndispersed (improved affordability, reduced general infrastructure costs and improved productivity), local\ngovernments, generally, do not have strong incentives to increase development opportunities.\nThere are several options that could be considered to increase development rights through zoning reform.\nUsing State Government powers to increase the supply of\ndevelopment rights\nMost successful international and domestic reform efforts have focused on national or state governments taking\ngreater responsibility for land use regulations, including plan making and assessing development applications.\nFor example, after years of declining affordability, the New Zealand Government undertook a series of ambitious\nreforms to increase housing supply (Box 10.2). These reforms included the national government directly involving\nitself in plan making and setting regulations constraining how local governments can use zoning and have been\nassociated with significant increases in housing supply and improved affordability.\nOther Australian state governments are also becoming more involved in planning decisions. The NSW\nGovernment, for example, has introduced reforms that 'upzone' land close to transport hubs to allow higher\ndensities, and provide additional planning capacity for 138,000 new homes (NSW Government 2023, 2024b). Some\nstakeholders advocated for the Queensland Government to liberalise planning, for example:\nRecent movements by the Victorian and NSW Governments — and especially the very recent\nannouncement by the ACT Government — of broad-based upzoning makes the entire market\nmore tractable, accessible and open. (Greater Brisbane, sub. 11, p. 1)\nThe Victorian, South Australian and Western Australian governments have or are proposing to become more\ninvolved in development assessment. In March 2024, the Western Australian Government implemented reforms to\nallow housing projects of over $2 million and all social housing projects to opt in to being assessed by the State’s\nDevelopment Assessment Panels. South Australia introduced a single planning system, replacing local\ngovernments in plan making and development assessment.\nThe Queensland Government has a relatively hands-off approach to planning, delegating significant powers to\nlocal governments. However, the State retains significant powers to control the planning system and could play a\ngreater role.\nFor example, the Queensland Government has previously used Priority Development Areas and Temporary Local\nPlanning Instruments (TLIP) to take control of local plan making and assessment, including the Bowen Hills Priority\nDevelopment Area and the Kurilpa TLIP, which suspends the Brisbane City Council’s planning scheme to allow\ngreater density. It has also opened a streamlined assessment pathway for social housing across the state.\nGiven the inherent impediments to reform facing local governments, the state could take a significantly stronger\nrole in planning and zoning to increase the supply of development rights, particularly in areas where increases in\ndensity are likely to provide significant benefit.\nAs an initial step, the State Government could identify well located areas near activity centres and surrounding\ntransport hubs in SEQ and regional cities where housing densities could be increased. To achieve change, the State\nGovernment could increase the allowable densities in these areas by amending local planning schemes or setting\nrules for locations that local governments must implement in their planning schemes.\nLike New Zealand, prior to implementing change, the Queensland Government should ensure the community is\nfully engaged by clearly communicating the need for change and consulting with local government and affected\ncommunities to minimise any negative impacts.

In these cases, a complementary approach would be to design\nbetter local land and housing supply targets and hold local governments publicly accountable for delivering on\nthose targets.\nThe NSW Productivity Commission (2021) recommended that housing targets be:\n• transparent and evidence-based\n• sufficiently forward-looking to ensure timely services provision and allow for community engagement\n• flexible enough to evolve with the economy and societal trends\n• supported by strong governance that monitors progress and mitigates risks and uncertainties as they arise.\nThe NSW Government has designed and set new housing targets for local governments, requiring councils to allow\nmore new housing developments, including in well located areas. They released 5-year Local Government Area\n(LGA) housing completion targets for 43 LGAs, and one target for regional NSW. Reforms have also addressed\nbarriers to the timely issuing of development approvals, including financial incentives for councils to help achieve\nhousing completion targets and improve planning performance.\nGiven Queensland urban councils are geographically large, targets set at the local government level may not be\nspecific enough to achieve optimal outcomes. For example, LGA level targets may not achieve efficient use of\ninfrastructure or deliver the right mix of density to maximise community benefits. This may mean targets would\nneed to be more granular, to ensure housing is delivered where people want to live.\nCurrent monitoring of performance (in SEQ) occurs through the Growth Monitoring Program. The most recent\npublished report (2021) estimates that many councils are not meeting land supply and planning approvals targets\n(DSDMIP 2022). However, some of the measures may not be providing useful measures of supply relative to\ndemand and the data is not provided in a timely manner to the public.34\nPublic reporting of performance can be an important accountability mechanism and can help to incentivise\nimproved outcomes. Local governments could be required to annually publish outcomes, including the increase in\nzoning supply and development rights in well located areas, and new land and housing delivered. This could also\ninclude whether targets have been met, and, where they have not been met, the reason. The Queensland\nGovernment could consolidate and publish this performance information on a regular basis.\nWhile Queensland currently reports on land supply targets through the Land Supply and Development Monitoring\n(LSDM) program, stakeholders have expressed concerns about the suitability of this reporting as a true\naccountability measure. Several stakeholders have called for independence of the Growth Monitoring Authority to\nbetter report on housing supply targets (Planning Institute of Australia, sub. 13, p. 5).\nIt is not clear that setting targets alone would create sufficient incentives for local governments to increase land\nsupply for development.\nIn Queensland, more strategic direction from the State Government is needed to support Local\nGovernment implementation - particularly through detailed planning guidelines and practical\ntools, not just numerical supply targets. (Real Estate Institute of Queensland, sub. 67, p. 11)\n34 For example, the years of approved supply benchmarks shift over time relative to historical approvals, rather than a measure\nof demand. The years of approved supply measure is calculated by dividing the total number of uncompleted dwelling approvals\nfor the LGA as at the reporting period by the average dwelling building approvals of the previous four years. Noosa for example\nhas experienced tightening planning approval supply and worsening housing affordability but improving performance against\nbenchmarks.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 166", "text_len": 4035, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The advantage of\nthis approach is that it sets outcomes and provides incentives but allows local governments and communities to\ndecide how to achieve them.\nA similar approach has been adopted under the National Housing Accord, with a $3 billion New Home Bonus\nprogram providing performance‑based funding to incentivise states and territories to achieve more than their\nshare of the one million well‑located homes target (Australian Government n.d.). The NSW Government will also be\nproviding incentives to local governments to meet housing targets and improve performance through their Faster\nAssessments program. The program includes $200 million of financial incentives for councils to help achieve\nhousing targets and improve planning performance. Guidelines have yet to be released (NSW Government 2025c).\nThe Queensland Government has made financial incentives available through a $2 billion Residential Activation\nFund. As noted earlier, this approach may not be the most efficient form of incentive if it discourages efficient\ninfrastructure use. However, this approach may better align existing infrastructure funding with housing targets,\nincentivising local governments to allow more development in well located areas and alleviate financial pressures\non faster growing councils.\nThe Commission is seeking stakeholder views on whether and how new housing targets should be set, whether\nthere may be significant costs or risks with the public reporting of local government performance, how effective\nfinancial incentives and penalties may be in improving performance, and whether local governments currently face\nfinancial disincentives to allowing more housing.\nProvide mechanisms to allow residents to opt-out of zoning types\nA third complementary reform option is to provide some flexibility for existing residents to determine local zoning\nat a small geographic level. This may help alleviate residents' concerns about change by allowing residents to\nagree to development that best matches their preferences.\nUnder traditional arrangements, resident groups who seek to avoid negative impacts from development are left\nwith few options but to lobby against development. This often leads to broad prohibitions against some types of\ndevelopment, particularly those of greater density, even in areas where residents are not necessarily opposed and\nwould benefit from it. There are examples from overseas jurisdictions where existing residents are incentivised to\ndetermine allowable development and increase densities. For example:\n• Israel allows residents to bypass normal planning restrictions on building size where outcomes can be\nnegotiated between developers and existing residents (Box 10.3).\n• Houston, in the U.S. has a system that allows residents to opt-in or opt-out of zoning restrictions on a small\nareas basis (Box 10.4).\nWhile the approaches above are materially different from the current approach to development approvals in\nQueensland, they enable negotiations to occur between residents and developers to achieve mutually beneficial\noutcomes.\nDesigning a reform for Queensland circumstances would require significant policy work and initial piloting to\ndetermine if it is workable. For example, determining the appropriately sized geographic areas for local decision-\nmaking and the level of resident support required for opting out of the zoning system would be a challenging\nissue.\nThe Commission is seeking stakeholders' views on how an approach enabling more local community control over\nland use could be developed in a Queensland context. For example, views on the geographic level at which\ndecisions would be best made and on how consensus could be reached at a local level would be helpful.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 167", "text_len": 3995, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For existing owners, the\ndeveloper provides compensation, either in the form of a cash payment or an upgraded new dwelling.\nMunicipalities maintain some control over allowable building heights, but these controls are limited.\nWhile the priority of the scheme is to replace dangerous older dwelling stock, the scheme now delivers a\nthird of new Israeli homes — accounting for 37 per cent of Israel’s housing construction and half of Tel\nAviv’s new construction.\nSource: Alster 2024.\nBox 10.4 Case study 3 – Local control in Houston\nRather than a system of zoning regulation, the US city of Houston has a code of ordinances that set a\nrange of minimum features such as lot size, setbacks and minimum car-parking requirements. This is\ncombined with private deed restrictions that restrict how land may be used, including effective density\nlimits.\nHistorically, Houston has remained affordable since low regulatory barriers have made building houses\nrelatively easy. However, the density limits enacted through the city ordinances, combined with a\npermissive attitude to building outwards led a rapid urban sprawl.\nIn recognition of the costs associated with this sprawl, in 1988 Houston City Council implemented\nreforms giving landowners automatic permission (subject to some conditions) to build on smaller lots,\nallowing subdivision and townhouses.\nThis was implemented alongside mechanisms for residents to opt out of allowing this type of\ndevelopment in their area. The mechanism to opt out is relatively simple, requiring a petition with a\nsimple majority of property owners or no dissents in an area.\nThis system allows small sections of the community to opt out of densification where most residents are\nstrongly opposed and to opt in where owners foresee benefits.

For existing owners, the |  | \n |  | developer provides compensation, either in the form of a cash payment or an upgraded new dwelling. |  | \n |  | Municipalities maintain some control over allowable building heights, but these controls are limited. |  | \n |  | While the priority of the scheme is to replace dangerous older dwelling stock, the scheme now delivers a |  | \n |  | third of new Israeli homes — accounting for 37 per cent of Israel’s housing construction and half of Tel |  | \n |  | Aviv’s new construction. |  | \n |  | Box 10.4 Case study 3 – Local control in Houston |  | \n |  | Rather than a system of zoning regulation, the US city of Houston has a code of ordinances that set a |  | \n |  | range of minimum features such as lot size, setbacks and minimum car-parking requirements. This is |  | \n |  | combined with private deed restrictions that restrict how land may be used, including effective density |  | \n |  | limits. |  | \n |  | Historically, Houston has remained affordable since low regulatory barriers have made building houses |  | \n |  | relatively easy. However, the density limits enacted through the city ordinances, combined with a |  | \n |  | permissive attitude to building outwards led a rapid urban sprawl. |  | \n |  | In recognition of the costs associated with this sprawl, in 1988 Houston City Council implemented |  | \n |  | reforms giving landowners automatic permission (subject to some conditions) to build on smaller lots, |  | \n |  | allowing subdivision and townhouses. |  | \n |  | This was implemented alongside mechanisms for residents to opt out of allowing this type of |  | \n |  | development in their area. The mechanism to opt out is relatively simple, requiring a petition with a |  | \n |  | simple majority of property owners or no dissents in an area. |  | \n |  | This system allows small sections of the community to opt out of densification where most residents are |  | \n |  | strongly opposed and to opt in where owners foresee benefits.

However, determining and garnering that support can be difficult, and successful reform efforts are\nusually preceded by significant engagement effort.\nAs noted in the previous chapter, New Zealand reforms to increase density in Auckland were preceded by\nsignificant efforts to promote the benefits of reform. As a result, a broad coalition of groups came to support\nreforms, including younger cohorts, environmentalists, social housing providers, developers, builders and urbanists.\nThe use of independent rigorous analysis was also used to build bipartisan support and inform community\nperceptions.\nRecent reforms to increase density in NSW and New Zealand have followed inquiries by both jurisdictions’\nproductivity commissions. These inquiries presented the public and decisions makers with a broad range of\nevidence and ensured the benefits such as improved local amenity, and lower environmental costs and commuting\ntimes were acknowledged, not just the costs (NSW Productivity Commission 2024, pp. 22-32).\nKey challenges\nA key issue making reform challenging is that the benefits tend to be dispersed across the broader community\nwhile the costs are often concentrated locally. This means that different parties have different incentives when it\ncomes to supporting or opposing individual developments (Figure 11.1). For example, immediate neighbours of a\nproposed development are likely to have stronger incentives to oppose development since they face significant\nreal or perceived costs, including disruption during construction, local congestion and other loss of amenity.\nHowever, the broader community is less likely to express support for individual developments since the benefits\n(such as increased affordability, reduced congestion, and greater access to shops and eateries), are more dispersed.\nFigure 11.1 Members of the community have varying incentives to support new housing developments\nSource: QPC.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 172", "text_len": 2276, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 175, "text": "Incentivising change\nThis means that broad support for increased density across the broader community is often countered by\nopposition at the local level, where existing residents commonly oppose developments located close to them.\nExacerbating these issues is a tendency for existing residents to over-estimate the costs of higher density and\nunder-estimate the benefits. Despite these concerns, studies show increasing density tends to be associated with\nincreased amenity (Ahlfeldt and Pietrostefani 2019b) and high-rise developments tend not to impact dwelling\nvalues nearby (Tulip and Lanigan 2021), despite community perceptions.\nImprove information on the benefits of reform\nThe evidence suggests opposition to increased density largely stems from public perceptions around two\nphenomena — that new supply will reduce incumbent residents’ amenity and/or house values and scepticism that\nincreased supply would help to improve affordability (Susan McKinnon Foundation 2023; Nall et al. 2022; Garvin\n2023).\nThese perceptions can lead to strong opposition to new housing, which, in turn, can increase pressure on policy\nmakers to implement more restrictive zoning regulation, additional character and heritage preservation and other\nimpediments to increases in density (such as more complex and costly development assessment criteria).\nPolitical scientists and legal scholars have recently found that economic illiteracy is also a contributing factor in\nwhy people oppose new housing (Nall et al. 2022):\nUsing data from two nationally representative surveys of urban and suburban residents, we posit\na further cause of the housing shortage: public misunderstanding of housing markets. Through\nvignettes describing a 10% shock to regional housing supply, we find that only about 30–40% of\nrespondents believe that additional supply would reduce prices and rents. … It also appears to be\nspecific to housing: respondents generally gave correct answers to questions about supply shocks\nin other markets.\nThe findings have been duplicated in Australia, with one third of surveyed Australians believing that more housing\nwould result in higher rather than lower prices (Garvin 2023). Similarly, only 27 per cent of Australians polled\nthought building more homes would decrease housing prices (Susan McKinnon Foundation 2023). Often described\nas ‘supply scepticism’, this can contribute to people opposing new supply, particularly apartments.\nEnsuring that a case for reform is developed and properly communicated will help ensure community discussion is\nbased on rigorous analysis and contributes positively to better policy making and planning decision-making.\nAt a local level, processes where residents are clearly informed of proposed development, and concerns are seen to\nbe taken seriously, are more likely to be successful because they can avoid the intensification of opposition\n(Davidson et al. 2013, p.153). Providing more information earlier to clarify the benefits and costs of a proposed\ndevelopment can help reduce the development and entrenchment of community opposition arising from initial\nuncertainty.\nEnsure community views and preferences are properly represented\nCommunity engagement is an important part of the decision-making process. As such, it needs to be conducted\ncarefully to ensure that it is representative of community views.\nTraditional consultation processes tend to give voice to strong local opponents of development dominating the\ndebate at the expense of those indifferent to or likely to benefit. This can occur as traditional consultation\nprocesses often suffer from self-selection bias.\nFor example, existing residents may have strong incentives to oppose change if they perceive change as\nproblematic (including the disruption likely to occur during development) and so are likely to engage consultation\nprocesses. However, those most likely to benefit from development (i.e. those affected by housing shortages) are\nmore dispersed, and unlikely to vocally support local initiatives. For example, a housing development in a local\nstreet is likely to be vocally opposed by existing residents if they perceive it will have negative consequences for\nthem, but unlikely to equally be vocally supported by those seeking a home (Duranton & Puga 2020).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 173", "text_len": 4325, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

According to the Susan\nMcKinnon Foundation (2023), renters and people under 55 are more likely to think providing more housing is more\nimportant than preserving local character.\nCitizen panels are one form of consultation that has been adopted in many international jurisdictions to ensure\nthat community consultation is representative (see Box 11.1).\nThey involve the careful selection of members of the public, including members of groups which are traditionally\nmore difficult to engage, to ensure consultation is representative of the entire community. To facilitate\nparticipation, panel attractive models of engagement are often used, simplifying the process and minimising costs\nto participants.\nBox 11.1 Citizen panels in Lower Hutt, New Zealand\nFrom 2016 to 2023, Lower Hutt, a regional council within the greater Wellington area, implemented a\nreformed planning system which delivered medium- and high-density housing in residential areas of the\ncity. This was achieved by enabling medium densities, mixed use, a wider range of housing styles and\nsizes and reducing parking requirements.\nPrior to reform, the region had low projected population growth, poor economic outcomes, a struggling\nretail sector and poverty on the outskirts of the city. However, there had been a modest uptick in\npopulation growth as undersupply of housing in Wellington City led to out-migration. This placed\npressure on rental affordability and drove higher house prices in Lower Hutt. These issues were\ncomplicated by Lower Hutt’s topology. Situated within a valley and constrained by steep hills, mountains\nand the sea, outward development was constrained, leaving increased density as the only realistic option\nto increase housing supply.\nA unique feature of this reform process in Lower Hutt was the engagement of a ‘citizens panel’, a\nrepresentative body designed to complement the voluntary submissions made to the local government.\nThis mechanism helped provide decision makers with a more representative view of the population’s\nperceptions about higher density. The panel showed that 69 per cent of the community supported\nrezoning for medium-density, compared to only 44 per cent using the traditional submissions process.\nThis allowed decision makers to be confident that the decisions they made to increase density were\nsupported by the community.\nSource: Maltman & Greenaway-McGrevy 2024.\nAnother option for building consensus for change includes the use of independent hearing panels. In New Zealand\nthese panels consist of independent experts who undertake open public consultation and recommend changes to\nlocal planning schemes to government.\nWhile independent hearing panels have been used with mixed success in New Zealand cities, when implemented\nproperly, these panels have been able to successfully engage the community on change.\nTo better support reform effort and ensure more informed consultation, existing guidance (DSDILGP 2017) could\nbe reviewed, updated and provided to state and local government planning regulators on best practice\nconsultation. Similar guides from other jurisdictions (for example, WA Government 2024b) could be drawn upon.\nTo assist final development of recommendations, the Commission is seeking stakeholders' views on regulators'\ncurrent approaches to community consultation and engagement, how they could be improved, and what could be\nincluded in guidance on these issues.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 174\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | Box 11.1 Citizen panels in Lower Hutt, New Zealand |  | \n |  | From 2016 to 2023, Lower Hutt, a regional council within the greater Wellington area, implemented a |  | \n |  | reformed planning system which delivered medium- and high-density housing in residential areas of the |  | \n |  | city.

If incentives are closely tied to the decision\nabout whether to upzone, and homeowners can make the choice for themselves, then developers\ncan offer strong-enough incentives for new development to make homeowners the most powerful\npolitical engine in support of densification (Alster 2024).\nThe achievement of mutually beneficial outcomes would support construction productivity by allowing developers\nan opportunity to build to a more efficient scale, design or method, while simultaneously benefiting the affected\ncommunity.\nClear limits on negotiable conditions would need to be developed, to ensure negotiated outcomes do not produce\nadverse outcomes (such as run-off that creates problems for those who are not immediate neighbours), and so\nthat costly or protracted negotiations can be easily avoided. Further, community members may need some\nassistance in reaching a negotiated outcome with a developer, possibly with mechanisms to help ensure outcomes\nare beneficial to the community.\nWhile local governments may already allow for some relaxation of regulations in certain circumstances, there could\nbe opportunities to extend their prevalence, so they become a more standard feature to complement the\napplication of planning regulations.\nHowever, some consideration needs to be given to the design of any policies designed to enable negotiated\noutcomes so that:\n• there is sufficient regulatory flexibility to incentivise negotiation — parties are unlikely to participate in\nnegotiations if there is no possibility of an allowable negotiated outcome (such as removing a height restriction\nin return for more greenspace) and the benefits generated are worth the expense of entering a negotiation\n• parties have the capacity to undertake a negotiation — including that all parties have access to information,\nunderstand their obligations and are capable of consenting to an agreement\n• agreed outcomes are enforceable.\nTo assist further development of recommendations, the Commission is seeking stakeholders' views on how the\nbenefits of development could be better shared with the community, and the mechanisms for doing so, including\nfacilitating direct negotiation between developers and residents.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 175", "text_len": 2820, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

These\ninclude the use of building and plumbing codes to set desired standards of construction as well as provisions\nfor the certification of buildings against these standards.\n• Financial regulation — regulations administered by the Queensland Building and Construction Commission\n(QBCC) intended to ensure the financial integrity of the building and construction industry in Queensland, protect\nconsumers, and reduce the risk of insolvencies and disputes. These include financial reporting requirements and\nthe need for certain contractors to establish project trust accounts.\n• Matters affecting modern methods of construction (MMC) — current regulatory settings may impact on\nnew and innovative construction methods and products.\n• Workplace health and safety regulation — regulations designed to minimise the risk of accidents and injuries.\nThese include both rules around safe work practices, hazard identification and training, as well as associated\nadministrative and reporting requirements.\nRegulations affecting land use (including planning policies and restrictions) and the labour market (such as\noccupational licensing) are canvassed in other parts of this interim report.\nConsistent with the terms of reference, this part will primarily focus on regulation within the control of the\nQueensland Government. However, where there are identified critical issues that fall within the scope of local\ngovernment or Australian Government policy, the inquiry will seek to provide options to inform engagement on\nthese matters.\nMuch of the material covered in this part is highly technical in nature. For example, the National Construction Code\n(NCC), which is Australia’s primary set of technical design and construction provisions for buildings, and forms the\nbasis for Queensland’s building code, is over 2,000 pages and includes hundreds of technical requirements for\nresidential and commercial buildings (PC 2025a). The Commission will not be commenting on the technical\nelements of these regulatory requirements.\nNevertheless, the Commission is seeking opportunities to improve the operation of regulation where there:\n• is a strong case for removing regulation, where is it unlikely to compromise worker or consumer safety\n• seem to be opportunities to improve the way regulations are implemented and enforced or\n• is a compelling case that needs to be investigated in more detail.\nNot all matters that were raised during the Commission’s initial round of consultation have been considered in this\npart. We will continue to review submissions and assess reform options as we develop the final report.\nStakeholders are encouraged to make submissions to raise further matters relating to the regulation of building\nactivities, where these are likely to have a significant effect on construction productivity.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 179", "text_len": 3347, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Structural failures, such as the one seen in the Opal Tower in Sydney in 2018, and fire hazards, like\nthe 2014 Lacrosse Tower fire in Melbourne, highlight the serious consequences of these risks.\nThe potential impacts associated with unsafe and poorly designed buildings include physical harm to occupants,\nfinancial losses for owners and insurers, and likely broader impacts on the community in the event of a major\nincident. Given the extensive number of buildings in Australia, their high economic value, and the substantial costs\nof repair or reconstruction, even a small percentage of buildings being unsafe or poorly designed would represent\na significant problem.\nIn an ideal world, all stakeholders would have complete and accurate information about building safety, and the\nfull costs and benefits of construction decisions would be borne by the relevant parties. This would incentivise the\nconstruction of safe buildings, as consumers would likely demand high safety standards and builders would bear\nthe full costs of any safety failures.\nHowever, there are two key issues that mean markets may not always deliver buildings to the standards expected\nby the community without some form of regulation:\n• Information asymmetries — purchasers of construction services often lack the necessary information to\naccurately assess the safety and quality of work (particularly for more complex structural features). This can\neither lead to poor decision-making or require consumers to conduct expensive and time-consuming searches.\n• Externalities — the costs of building failures, such as injuries, deaths, or property damage, are often borne by\nindividuals other than the purchaser and so may not be factored into the decision-making process. Typical\nexternalities include environmental pollution, the use of hazardous materials (e.g. asbestos) and negative safety\noutcomes.\nThe use of building codes\nBuilding codes and standards are a key regulatory response to these market failures. Modern building codes date\nback to the Metropolitan Buildings Act 1944 (UK) and have been used to establish minimum standards for the\ndesign, construction, and maintenance of buildings, in areas such as structural and fire safety, health and\nsanitation, and light and ventilation. Effective enforcement of these standards can:\n• reduce information asymmetry by setting a baseline of safety and quality that consumers can expect\n• mitigate the risk of building failures and potential hazards that could lead to harm or economic loss.\nBuilding codes can also provide a clear standard against which liability can be assessed, helping ensure that\nbuilders bear the full costs of any issues that arise due to their work.\n12.2 The regulatory framework in Queensland\nAs shown in Figure 12.1 there is a range of Queensland legislation that establishes the standards and processes for\nbuilding and construction activities, with responsibilities shared between the state government (which determines\nrelevant requirements in legislation) and local government (which has responsibility for local standards and\ndevelopment assessment). This includes:\n• the Building Act 1975 (the Building Act) and Plumbing and Drainage Act 2018 (the Plumbing Act) and their\nsubordinate instruments, which regulate building and plumbing standards. These legislative instruments also\ngive legal affect to:\nQueensland Productivity Commission 181", "text_len": 3596, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This is because any observed improvements in safety and quality may also\nbe due to advancements in construction techniques, materials, and technology, commercial reputation as well as\nheightened public awareness and demand for safer buildings (CIE 2012).\nDespite the existence of stringent building codes, there is still the potential for defects and casualties from unsafe\nbuildings if codes become excessively complex (making compliance difficult and lead to unintentional violations)\nor there is ineffective compliance (for example because builders or consumers lose confidence in the standards)\nand enforcement.\nThe Australian Productivity Commission has noted that the NCC is ‘sound in principle’ and that when it is\n‘implemented consistently across all jurisdictions, [it] encourages scale, efficiency and transferability’ (PC 2025a).\nThe introduction of Australia’s single national, performance-based building and plumbing code has been\nestimated to have delivered significant economic benefits ($1.1 billion annually) through nationally consistent\nrequirements, improved productivity, increased flexibility and the ability to use new and innovative materials (CIE\n2012).\nHowever, many industry stakeholders have expressed concerns about an increase in complexity and cost\nassociated with compliance with the NCC and that NCC 2022 has caused a ‘significant burden’ to builders (Liu\n2025). This is a view shared by the Australian Productivity Commission, with their chair, Danielle Wood, recently\nstating:\nWe think there should be a good look at the NCC which is one source of regulatory burden where\nwe think there's scope to improve.

(ABCB 2011)\nHowever, building codes appear to have moved beyond providing minimum safety and quality standards to also,\nin the view of industry, driving ‘market best practice’ and other societal goals (Master Builders Queensland, sub. 43,\np. 17; Housing Industry Association, sub. 32, pp. 18-21). In addition, many changes to the NCC have been adopted\ndespite them not being the option estimated to have the highest net benefit — and in some cases have been\nadopted despite analysis showing they would result in significant net costs to the community (see Box 12.2\noverleaf).\nThe evidence suggests that recent changes, including additions to NCC 2022 related to ‘liveable housing’ and\nenergy efficiency requirements, have increased construction costs for builders, who are likely to pass them on to\nconsumers in the form of higher prices (Lia 2022). While these changes are also likely to provide some benefits,\nsuch as improved accessibility and energy performance, regulatory impact analysis undertaken showed these\nbenefits were unlikely to justify the costs they impose.\nSubmissions to this inquiry reflected different stakeholder views on these requirements and their impact, with\nindustry advocating for exemptions or voluntary implementation, while others supported their retention in\nQueensland's building codes (Housing Industry Association, sub. 32, pp. 18-21; Master Builders Queensland, sub.\n43, pp. 17-21; Australian Network for Universal Housing Design, sub. 3; Australian Glass & Window Association,\nsub. 33; Melbourne Disability Institute, sub. 22; Q Shelter, sub. 55).\nThe Commission has not sought to verify the various claims made by stakeholders, noting the Regulatory Impact\nStatement (RIS) provided opportunities for stakeholder engagement. The independent economic analysis\nundertaken, which suggested both the energy efficiency and accessibility standards would result in a net cost to\nthe community, was subject to public consultation and assessed as compliant with best practice regulatory\nprinciples by the (then) Commonwealth Office of Best Practice Regulation.\nThere is scope for Queensland to ‘opt out’ of standards that do not have a demonstrated net benefit\nAs noted, the ABCB Intergovernmental Agreement states that any changes to the NCC should generate a net\nbenefit. Making changes to the NCC, without demonstrated community benefit, can undermine the effectiveness\nof, and confidence in, the NCC and the amendment process. Ultimately, such a result leads to poorer outcomes for\nthe industry, consumers, and society as a whole.\nIt is therefore within the purview of the Queensland Government to amend or ‘opt-out’ of any provisions of the\nNCC via the QDC and QPWC, if they are deemed to not be in the State’s interest. While the ABCB\nIntergovernmental Agreement commits each jurisdiction to minimise variations to the NCC, it also provides for\nvariations where:\nthere is a net benefit as evidenced by a Regulatory Impact Assessment conducted in accordance\nwith assessment processes in each jurisdiction. (ABCB 2020, p. 25)\nWhile there is benefit to national harmonisation of building rules, through the NCC, builders are not restricted from\nadopting stronger efficiency or accessibility standards where they believe there are benefits from doing so.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 184", "text_len": 3722, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Impact analysis (including in some instances a RIS) has been undertaken on the\nproposals, with some expected to result in significant costs. For example, it is claimed that the provision for\ncommercial electric vehicle charging is expected to result in a net cost of at least $1.5 billion (Keating 2024).\nThe ABCB has stated, in March 2025, that:\nwe have not yet provided our final advice to Building Ministers and, therefore, no decision has\nbeen made about the content, publication or commencement of any future edition (ABCB 2025).\nGiven the potential impacts on housing affordability, the Queensland Government should ensure that future\nchanges to building codes including for NCC, have been through robust regulatory impact analysis and\ndemonstrate they provide net benefits to the community.\nFrequent changes can also result in increased regulatory burdens\nStakeholders have expressed concerns about the cost to purchase Australian Standards, the rate at which building\nstandards and code changes occur and that there is insufficient adjustment time between changes (Housing\nIndustry Association, sub. 32, pp. 18-20; Master Builders Queensland, sub. 43, pp. 19-21). Similarly, stakeholders\nstated the rapid pace of change was increasing the rate of building defects and rectification works, sometimes\nsimply because a builder was unaware of a new requirement. The Housing Industry Association has also previously\nclaimed that the NCC amendment process can result in uneven building activity, with a spike in building before a\nNCC change comes into effect, followed by a sharp decline (Suljanovic 2024).\nHowever, some stakeholders consider that regular updates to the NCC are needed to ensure Australia’s building\nstock remains resilient and that lengthening the time between updates could also increase compliance costs for\nindustry and reduce the benefits of a harmonised NCC (Liu 2025; Perinotto 2024; Sweeney 2025). Australian\nSustainable Built Environment Council (sub. 58, p. 1) stated:\nContinued commitment to a regular NCC review cycle is essential to minimise duplication, support\ncompliance, enable economies of scale and provide industry with certainty.\nProviding greater advance notice of changes to the NCC and allowing more time for implementation are likely to\nbenefit industry as it would improve compliance rates and allow businesses to plan and adjust their practices and\nallocate resources effectively (Coglianese 2015).\nThe Queensland Government has already committed to ‘provide a clear and consistent approach to\nimplementation timeframes for future NCC updates’ (Department of Housing and Public Works 2025a).\nConsideration could also be given to either increasing the NCC amendment cycle (for example, every five years),\nlike that implemented by the Tasmanian Government, or imposing a moratorium on future changes for a set\nnumber of years.\nWhile this would provide more certainty for the industry and allow more time for businesses to adapt to changes,\nthis would need to be weighed against the risk of codes becoming outdated, not keeping pace with advances in\nbuilding technology, changes in societal expectations, or other emerging issues.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 186", "text_len": 3712, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

A new leadership group has been\nappointed.

But beyond these operational\nchanges, the key question is whether the regulatory framework QBCC operates under provides the right incentives\nto effectively and efficiently deliver its activities.\nThe Commission is seeking to understand whether there are any elements of the regulatory framework the QBCC\noperates under that act as barriers or provide poor incentives to improve regulator performance.\nOne area of opportunity could be in the organisation’s overarching governance, which has been described as the\n'crucial ingredient' in good regulatory performance (OECD 2021). There are a number of features of good\ngovernance, which should have the end goal of better performance and consumer outcomes, including technical\nrigour, objectivity and predictability (OECD 2021).37\nIn this light, the QBCC and Queensland Government should evaluate the outstanding recommendations of the\n2022 QBCC governance review and, if they are still considered appropriate, prioritise their implementation.38\nNotable recommendations where work is continuing, or has yet to commence, includes strengthening and\nenhancing staffing capability and implementing a 'contemporary and sustainable funding model' (Queensland\nGovernment 2024i).\nThere may be opportunities to improve measures of performance\nClearly articulated objectives and robust outcome-based performance indicators are also important for the\ngovernance of regulators.\nUnless clear objectives are specified, the regulator may not have sufficient context to establish priorities,\nprocesses and boundaries for its work.

In response, the QBCC has recently\nintroduced measures such as a customer improvement plan, however, it is too early to tell if these measures have\nbeen successful.\nPromisingly, the Queensland Government has also recently introduced the legislative changes, as part of its\nBuilding Reg Reno (Tranche 3), to enable ‘user-friendly electronic services’ and support digital licensing for QBCC\nlicensees (Queensland Government 2025c).\nThe Commission is considering if there are other options that would help ensure QBCC is focussed on continual\nimprovement and is interested in any stakeholder views on this matter.\n12.6 Additional regulatory issues\nStakeholder submissions also raised some additional regulatory issues related to contract values and the\nQueensland Home Warranty Scheme. The Commission is interested in further views on these issues.\nThreshold for insurable works\nIn Queensland, individuals and companies must hold a QBCC licence to carry out building work that is valued over\n$3,300. In addition, most residential building work (including renovations and repairs) in Queensland valued at\nmore than this value (including materials, labour and GST) must have cover under the Queensland Home Warranty\nScheme. The Scheme protects Queensland homeowners if a builder fails to complete the work or the building has\nstructural defects. To fund the Scheme, a builder pays premiums to the QBCC on behalf of the customer.\nAs the threshold value has been fixed at this value since 2000, stakeholders have raised concerns that it has not\nkept pace with construction costs or inflation. The current threshold for insurable works is significantly lower than\nother states. The threshold in South Australia, the Northern Territory, and the ACT is $12,000, while in New South\nWales and Western Australia it is $20,000 (HIA 2022a).\nHousing Industry Association (sub. 32, p. 17) stated that the threshold for insurable works under the Queensland\nHome Warranty Scheme should be raised to a ‘minimum’ of $20,000. It has also previously been suggested that\nthe threshold should be indexed annually (MBQ 2022, p. 3).\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that insurance claims under $11,000 occur far less than for higher thresholds (MBQ\n2022, p. 3). If the threshold was raised, consumers would still retain protection through the QBCC’s dispute\nresolution services and the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT) which manages disputes up to\n$25,000 (Housing Industry Association, sub. 32, p. 17).\nThe Queensland Government has previously announced it would undertake a review of both licensing and\ninsurance thresholds as part of its Building Reg Reno staged package of reforms (Department of Housing and\nPublic Works 2025a).\nThe Commission welcomes stakeholder views on this issue.\nDeposit caps\nIn Queensland, a contract for domestic building work valued above the $3,300 threshold must comply with the\nform and content requirements for domestic building contracts set out in Schedule 1B of the QBCC Act. The\nmaximum deposit for a Level 1 contract, up to $19,999, is 10 per cent (with some exceptions). The maximum\ndeposit for a level two contract ($20,000 or more) is five per cent (QBCC 2021b, p. 3 & 9). The premium for\nQueensland Home Warranty Scheme also needs to be paid from the deposit by whichever occurs earlier: the\ncommencement of works or ten business days from contract being entered into (QBCC 2021b, p. 6).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 189", "text_len": 3649, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Master Builders Queensland argues the 5 per cent deposit cap has not kept\npace with pre-construction costs which include design assessment for energy efficiency, site safety plans, a training\nlevy, portable long service leave levy and approval fees. It also argues there are significant challenges for small\nbusinesses who encounter cash flow issues and financial stress and can lead to project delays and affect security of\npayment (Master Builders Queensland, sub. 43, p. 12-13).\nMaster Builders Queensland has therefore recommended raising the maximum deposit cap for a domestic building\ncontract to ten per cent, to support contractors’ ability to fund up-front costs and manage their cash flow (Master\nBuilders Queensland, sub. 43, p. 14). Further, the Housing Industry Association have previously argued that\nwarranty scheme premiums could be paid separately to deposits:\nThis allows the contractor more money to adequately prepare for starting the building works and\nto use the full amount of the deposit for its intended purpose (HIA 2022a, p. 12).\nThe Commission welcomes stakeholder views on this issue.\n12.7 Regulatory review\nGiven the complexity of building regulation and the potential costs of regulatory or policy error, it is not possible\nfor the Commission to conduct an in-depth review of every regulatory standard affecting the building industry.\nNevertheless, there have been concerns that the stock of building regulation is affecting the productivity of the\nindustry (for example, see PC 2025).\nAs noted in Chapter 3, stock reviews are a useful tool for managing the stock of regulation since they allow for a\ntargeted in-depth review of regulatory areas.\nThe Commission is seeking stakeholder views on areas of regulation, that are significantly impacting productivity,\nthat would benefit from this approach.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 190", "text_len": 2045, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Whether due to misconduct or as a result of unfavourable\nmarket conditions outside a business’s control, the consequences of financial distress extend beyond those\nimmediately affected to other industry participants and customers. This could involve:\n• other contractors failing to receive payment (and possibly themselves entering financial difficulty)\n• impacts on workers and apprentices whose employment may be impacted by financial difficulties for their\nworkplace\n• end customers not receiving a good or service for which they have already paid.\nAccordingly, governments have sought various policy solutions that seek to reduce financial risk in the\nconstruction industry. However, most policy instruments impose obligations on a wide range of industry\nparticipants, even though only a small fraction of the industry may be responsible for the harm that is being\ntargeted. Consequently, where a problem warranting government intervention is identified, any obligations on\nindustry should be the minimum required to achieve the objective in order to avoid unnecessary costs on\nbusinesses and consumers.\nThis chapter explores two frameworks that distinguish the Queensland construction industry from other\njurisdictions, namely minimum financial requirements (MFR) and trust accounts.\nMinimum financial requirements\nQueensland building and construction contractor licensees are required to provide financial information to the\nQueensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC) under the MFR regime. These reporting requirements\nwere reinstated in 2019 following their removal in 2014. Exemptions are in place for some licensees who hold\nprofessional indemnity insurance (QBCC 2021d).39\nThe Queensland Building and Construction Commission (Minimum Financial Requirements) Regulation 2018 (the\nMFR Regulation) prescribes financial viability obligations that contractors must meet. Licensees are required to\ndemonstrate their ongoing financial sustainability to the QBCC through annual financial reporting.\nThe QBCC specifies a contractor’s allowable annual turnover (measured by maximum revenue) as:\n• a function of working capital (measured by net tangible assets)\n• subject to satisfying a current ratio of $1 in current assets for each $1 in current liabilities.\nThese requirements have the potential to impact industry capacity and productivity by limiting the pool of\ncontractors available to complete construction work. As detailed in Box 13.1, there are no comparable financial\nrequirements applied to the building and construction industries in other Australian jurisdictions.\n39 The exempt licence classes are building design – low rise, medium rise, and open; builder, project management services;\nhydraulic services design; site classifier; fire protection – water-based fire system stream—design and electrical electrical—\ndesign—fire alarm systems. Nominee supervisor licensees, site supervisor licensees, occupational licensees, building certifiers\nand pool safety inspectors do not have to meet any MFR obligations.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 194", "text_len": 3290, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For instance, under the\nVictorian Building Act 1993, building practitioners are subject to general financial probity requirements\n(for example, no outstanding judgement debts) but no specific MFR thresholds. Victorian builders must\nalso obtain domestic building insurance for work valued at more than $16,000, with insurance eligibility\nsubject to a financial assessment process. This implicitly imposes minimum standards on Victorian\nlicensees, but the requirements are not prescriptive in nature as is the case under Queensland regulatory\nrequirements.\nLikewise, in New South Wales, licensed builders and tradespeople must obtain home building\ncompensation cover for each home building project over $20,000. Again, eligibility for cover is subject to\nproviding a profit and loss statement and statement of personal assets and liabilities, but there are no\nprescribed thresholds that licensees must meet.\nSources: Building Commission NSW 2025; Victorian Managed Insurance Authority 2025.\nWhat problem do MFRs try to address?\nThe underlying problem that MFRs target is the rate and consequences of insolvencies on the construction\nindustry and the broader community. It is difficult to establish a robust counterfactual to inform how Queensland\ninsolvencies would have trended in the absence of these requirements. Nevertheless, it is possible to observe the\nextent to which Queensland insolvency rates have diverged from those of interstate jurisdictions without MFRs.\nFigure 13.1 displays standardised changes in insolvency rates for Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia.\nOver the last decade, Queensland insolvencies have followed much the same trend as states without comparable\nMFR obligations. Indeed, there is no significant change in insolvencies corresponding to the repeal of MFR\nreporting obligations (in 2014) and their reintroduction (in 2019).\nFigure 13.1 Standardised changes in insolvency rates by jurisdiction\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\nSource: QPC based on ASIC 2024.\nNote: Standardisation involves subtracting the average from each series and dividing by the standard deviation, allowing for magnitudes\nof changes to be comparable across jurisdictions. The formula for standardising insolvencies for a given state in a given quarter is\n(quarterly insolvency – average quarterly insolvencies) / standard deviation of insolvencies.\nThe findings are also consistent with a 2022 EY report commissioned by Master Builders Queensland, which found\nthat Queensland’s building and construction industry insolvency rates were broadly comparable to those in other\nAustralian jurisdictions that did not have similarly stringent MFR frameworks in place (EY 2022).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 195\nnaem\nmorf\nsnoitaived\ndradnatS\nNSW VIC SA QLD\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | Box 13.1 Arrangements in other jurisdictions |  | \n |  | The Commission is not aware of any comparable requirements in other Australian jurisdictions, nor do |  | \n |  | minimum financial requirements (MFR) appear to be used in other industries.

{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 198, "text": "Financial regulation\nIs MFR regulation effective and efficient?\nAvailable evidence indicates that MFR obligations impose material compliance costs without a clear reduction in\ninsolvency rates. For example, the aforementioned 2022 EY report for Master Builders Queensland estimated\nannual compliance costs of at least $78 million (EY 2022). These were estimated to be distributed across contractor\nlicensees as follows:\n• $689 per annum for small businesses\n• $3,416 per annum for medium businesses\n• $13,408 per annum for large businesses.\nThis compliance burden may be elevated for licensees in rural and regional areas, where access to legal,\naccounting and financial advice may be constrained compared to metropolitan areas.\nMFRs could also have the unintended consequence of discouraging business growth (with flow on effects to\nemployment, investment, and efficiency in the industry), as companies remain small to avoid higher reporting costs\nusually imposed on larger building and construction licensees. Falta and Gallery (2011) analysed data between\n2001 and 2006 for small and medium construction licensees regulated by the then Queensland Building Services\nAuthority (QBSA). They found that as many as 32 per cent of licensees were categorising themselves into lower\nlicence classes than would be implied by their financial position. While this analysis pertains to a previous\nregulatory framework, the underlying principles and efficiency applications remain broadly applicable to the\ncurrent regulatory arrangements, which potentially reduce industry capacity and productivity by limiting the ability\nof contractors to take on additional construction work.\nStakeholders noted that because financial requirements are calculated on national revenue, some contractors with\nnational or multijurisdictional operations have needed to establish separate Queensland entities, which has\ninvolved additional administration costs (Australian Constructors Association, sub. 39, p. 25). Stakeholders also told\nus that delayed or unpredictable payments to subcontractors can affect their ability to meet MFR requirements,\neven if their businesses are otherwise viable (Master Plumbers Association Queensland, sub. 62, p.5).\nRecent changes to MFRs in Queensland\nIn February 2025, the Queensland Government removed the requirement for individual operators in self-certifying\nlicence categories (with annual revenue below $800,000)40 to provide annual reports under the MFR regime. These\nobligations applied to more than 50,000 operators, equivalent to 97 per cent of all individual licensees. These\nlicensees will still need to meet MFR standards and the QBCC will retain its ability to audit licensees to ensure\ncompliance (Department of Housing and Public Works 2025b).\nThe removal of these reporting requirements is expected to reduce regulatory burden. It is unclear whether the\nremaining MFR reporting obligations are well-targeted, considering they now apply predominantly to larger\noperators. As outlined in Box 13.1, other Australian jurisdictions apply financial requirements via building insurance\napplications, which has the effect of aligning financial requirements with the scale of the work being undertaken.\nThis could be a potential option for consideration if MFR obligations were reduced or removed.\nThere appears to be an in-principle case for removing all remaining MFR reporting requirements, unless it can be\ndemonstrated that MFRs deliver net benefits to the Queensland community. The Commission is therefore seeking\nany further stakeholder views on the costs and benefits associated with the remaining MFR measures in effect and\nwhether there is scope to remove or streamline MFR obligations further.\n40 SC1 (annual revenue not exceeding $200,000) and SC2 (annual revenue not exceeding $800,000)\nQueensland Productivity Commission 196", "text_len": 3855, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This can lead to suboptimal levels of construction activity if parties\nopt not to enter into contracts because they are unable to ascertain risk. This also constrains productivity if\nbusinesses are reluctant to invest due to this uncertainty.\nCompounding this, the construction industry is dominated by small businesses with fewer than five people. As a\nresult, the industry is highly fragmented, with projects often divided into discrete tasks undertaken by various small\nbusinesses and contractors. This characteristic of the industry can have significant implications for construction\nproductivity if the financial difficulty of one operator causes larger disruptions to a building project.\nSlow or non-payment is potentially an underlying driver for insolvency. Analysis of trade receivables data indicates\nthat 5.2 per cent of payments in the construction industry are more than 60 days in arrears, the third-highest\nproportion of any industry (Pollack 2024). However, this proportion was less than half the 11.9 per cent rate\nobserved for the construction industry in June 2022 (Adams 2022).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 198", "text_len": 2412, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

As a\nresult, subcontractors can be exposed to risks from a head contractor’s other projects where they do not hold any\ninterest. There are also inherent timing issues for subcontractors if contract payment milestones are not aligned\nwith the completion of work by subcontractors. Master Plumbers Association Queensland (sub. 62, p. 4) raised\nconcerns about current processes linking subcontractor practical completion to overall project completion, and\ninstead proposed legislating decoupled definitions to avoid delayed payments.\nSeveral stakeholders told us that non-payment of subcontractors remains a significant issue within the\nconstruction industry (Master Plumbers Association Queensland, sub. 62, pp. 3-4; Master Electricians Australia, sub.\n37, p. 10; AMCA, NECA and NFIA, sub. 47, p. 3). Master Electricians Australia (sub. 37, p. 27) conducted an industry\nsurvey, which found that over 60 per cent of respondents had been unpaid in the last 5 years due to contractor\ninsolvency in both the commercial and residential sectors, with 87 per cent owed up to $100,000. Sixty-five per\ncent did not receive any of the money owed, and of these, 21 per cent of non-payments were by a residential\nbuilder, with most respondents finding the legislative framework difficult to understand.\nIs trust account regulation effective and efficient?\nTrust accounts aim to improve business confidence by providing processes for securing payment (Building Industry\nFairness Reforms Implementation and Evaluation Panel 2019). As stated by Building Trusts (sub. 42, p. 1):\nThe purpose of trust accounts is to protect subcontractors’ funds by ring-fencing payments that\nare owed to them, ensuring that money intended for subcontractors is not used to prop up other\nparts of the business.\nHowever, perceptions regarding the efficacy of trust accounts appear to differ across the construction industry.\nSome industry stakeholders have maintained that insufficient analysis was undertaken on the extension of the\nregulation to the private sector, and that the changes are having a perverse impact on industry without achieving\nenhanced security of payment (Housing Industry Association, sub. 32, p. 15; Australian Constructors Association,\nsub. 39, p. 25; Master Builders Queensland, sub. 43, pp. 35-36). Other stakeholders have expressed concerns about\nthe pause to the trust account rollout, instead advocating for stronger payment protections (Master Electricians\nAustralia, sub. 37, p. 11; AMCA, NECA and NFIA, sub. 47, p. 3; Master Plumbers Association Queensland, sub. 62, p.\n4).\nAny trust account requirements should facilitate efficient financial management\nA framework for enhancing security of payment will be more effective if it aligns as closely as possible with efficient\nfinancial management practices. Where regulation causes industry participants to depart from such practices\nwithout a commensurate reduction in excessive risk-taking behaviour or financial misconduct, the cost of\nregulation is likely to exceed any realised benefits. Indeed, a potential unintended consequence of trust accounts is\nthat the constraints on cash flow could increase the likelihood of a head contractor being unable to meet a\npayment obligation, even though the business’s operations are otherwise financially sound Australian Government\n2025b, p. 15). This would run contrary to the intent of improving payment outcomes and reducing insolvency risk\nin the construction industry.\nConsequently, there is a need to better understand how businesses and individuals would be likely to operate\nwithout trust account requirements (as in other Australian jurisdictions), how trust accounts induce changes in\nbehaviour, and what implications this has for construction productivity.\nIn essence, the BIF Act has introduced provisions that prohibit head contractors on a building project from using\nretentions or project funds as part of their cash flow or on other projects. At present, there is a lack of publicly\navailable evidence that illustrates how or whether trust accounts materially impact cash flow and how widespread\nthese challenges are. Most information is anecdotal and does not reveal the scope or scale of impacts.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 199", "text_len": 4478, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Contractors are\nlikely to incur material administrative, legal and accounting costs to understand and comply with trust account\nrequirements, and bear holding costs of having large amounts of working capital sitting in trust accounts and not\notherwise available to their business.\nQBCC data indicates that there were 1,319 active PTAs as at 31 March 2025, with a total building contract value of\n$35.2 billion. Of these, 634 PTAs were for private sector contracts with a total contract value of $24.5 billion\n(implying an average project value of $38.7 million). 516 RTAs had also been opened as at 31 March 2025. For\nhead contractors, the main compliance tasks associated with managing trust accounts include:\n• opening and closing trust accounts with approved financial institutions\n• notifying the QBCC, contracting party and subcontractor beneficiaries when certain events occur (for example,\nchanges to the name and/or financial institution of the account)\n• managing deposits into and withdrawals from trust accounts\n• record keeping and accounting (including ledgers, monthly reconciliation statements and other documentation)\n• training and legal advice to meet regulatory requirements.\nThe time involved with these tasks is likely to vary across projects, making it difficult to approximate compliance\ncosts across industry. While the analysis below predates the more recent stages of the phased rollout, industry has\npreviously estimated that:\n• trust accounting requirements alone could cost $178,000 per $3 million project (6 per cent of project costs) (HIA\n2019, p. 14).\n• construction costs could rise up to 3 per cent for smaller builders (compared to 1.5 per cent for larger builders),\ndue to a lack of economies of scale and administrative resources (Master Builders Queensland 2017a, p. 19).\nDeloitte Access Economics (2016) estimated that the introduction of trust accounts would deliver an overall net\nbenefit to the community, even though there would be a significant cost to head contractors of $1.5 billion over 20\nyears. However, the analysis relied on the assumption that subcontractors would reduce their pricing to reflect a\nreduced risk of delayed or non-payment. If no (or lower than modelled) savings eventuate, then the regulation\ncould result in a net cost to the community. At this stage, it is unclear to what extent such savings have been\nrealised. Contract pricing will be determined by a range of market factors, so it may be difficult to attribute a\nchange in pricing to perceptions of reduced risk.\nAlthough not specific to Queensland’s legislation, analysis commissioned by the Australian Small Business and\nFamily Enterprise Ombudsman (2018, p. 4) estimated that the cost of running a trust account was only 0.1 per cent\nof annual revenue for businesses with 20 employees, but this increased to 2 per cent of annual revenue for\nbusinesses with between 2 and 10 employees, and 3.5 to 4 per cent of annual revenue for sole traders.\nMaster Builders Queensland (sub. 43, pp. 35-36) noted a forthcoming report from EY, which has reviewed the\nperformance and efficacy of Queensland’s trust account arrangements based on consultation with stakeholders\nand their experience with the framework. Preliminary results indicate that whilst the framework has increased\nindustry fiscal discipline, there have been increased compliance costs without evidence of increased payment\nsecurity.\nWhile recent amendments are likely to have reduced the level of administrative burden for builders and\nsubcontractors, concern remains regarding their potential extension to private sector projects—especially the\nburden faced by builders for smaller projects valued between $1 million and $10 million, who may have limited\nadministrative resources to comply with legislation (Housing Industry Association, sub. 32, p. 15). This may act as a\nbarrier to smaller builders working on larger projects (such as small apartment buildings and townhouses), which\nwould have ramifications for housing supply and affordability.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 200", "text_len": 4376, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

In 2010, ‘inadequate cash flow or high\ncash use’ was cited in 35 per cent of Queensland insolvencies; by 2024 this was cited 49 per cent of the time.\nSimilarly, insolvencies attributed to trading losses have increased from 27 per cent to 52 per cent since 2010 in\nQueensland.

For example, stakeholders told us that resolving disputes through\nQCAT can take multiple years to conclude, with difficulties sourcing independent expert advice and enforcing\nQCAT orders (Housing Industry Association, sub. 32, p. 16; Master Plumbers Association Queensland, sub. 62, p. 5).\nThe Housing Industry Association (sub. 32, p.16) proposed that Queensland should allow for arbitration clauses in\ndomestic building contracts, citing South Australia as a jurisdiction where this approach has improved timeliness of\ncase resolutions.\nThese alternative mechanisms may only indirectly increase the likelihood that sufficient funds are on hand to meet\nobligations to subcontractors (for example, through the ability to liquidate assets).

Currently, around 3 to 5 per cent of all building construction in\nAustralia incorporates MMC methods (PC 2024).\nMMC takes multiple forms\nMMC varies from simple components to fully complete volumetric systems. Components are fabricated off-site in\nfactory-controlled settings enabling them to be standardised and manufactured concurrent with land preparation.\nMMC also incorporates new technologies such as digital tools, 3D printing, robotics, and artificial intelligence into\nthe design and construction process (PC 2024, p. 81).\nPrefabricated and modular construction include:\n• 1D prefab - simple linear components that involve some form of prefabrication to ease on-site erection. For\nexample, beams or columns needing to be bolted together (HIA 2022b, p. 4)\n• 2D prefab - pre-sized, pre-cut and pre-shaped components that are assembled on sites. This can include\nstructural panels for walls, floors or internal/external cladding systems. 2D prefab is easier to transport and lends\nitself to customisation\n• 3D prefab - pre-assembled modular components that can comprise a small building or pods (i.e., bathrooms,\nkitchen). 3D prefab typically comes fully finished only needing to be joined together on-site\n• Hybrid system - containing elements of more than one system, typically both 3D and 2D systems (Built Offsite\n2016, p. 23).\nCurrently, MMC is mostly used in the provision of health, education and commercial facilities and other\ninfrastructure. Its use for housing in Australia has been limited (prefabAUS n.d., p. 23), with significantly higher use\ninternationally (see Box 14.1).\nBox 14.1 Successful international examples of MMC\nInternationally, modern methods of construction (MMC) has achieved some success.

Between 2021-23, 17.5 per cent of\nworkplace fatalities in Queensland were in the construction industry, while 9.8 per cent were in manufacturing (Safe\nWork Australia n.d.).\nMMC also has the potential to harness the productivity benefits of data and digital technologies. The use of\ncomplete and accurate digital models for DfMA, inclusive of all elements such as fittings, can ensure the design is\naccurate to a few millimetres (Evans-Greenwood et al. 2019, p. 3-4). This aids manufacturers to explore the best\nmaterials, optimise processes, better understand specifications and tolerances and minimise components\n(prefabAUS 2022).\nPrefab and modular construction techniques could allow projects to be completed 20 to 50 per cent faster and\nreduce construction costs by as much as 20 per cent (Bertram et al. 2019). While upfront costs can be higher than\nconventional methods (Welsh School of Architecture 2006, pp. 35–36), savings can come through reduced waste\nand greater efficiency, such as better alignment with building schedules, and control of delays associated with\nweather conditions, specialist trades availability and supplies delivery.42\nA relevant example is the La Trobe building in Melbourne, one of Australia's tallest prefabricated buildings. This\ntower was completed in 30 per cent less time (19 months instead of 26 months) than a neighbouring tower of\nsimilar size that used conventional methods (Evans-Greenwood et al. 2019, p. 6).\nThe Australian Productivity Commission (2024) undertook stylised modelling to assess the impact of removing\nbarriers to MMC, assuming a 10 to 20 per cent uptake and an increase in residential construction output by 2 per\ncent. This modelling estimated real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Australia would increase by 0.15 per cent (or\n$4.1 billion) due to increased residential construction output and by 0.06 per cent (or $1.7 billion) due to high non-\nresidential construction output. The modelling also estimated a decrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) by 0.08\nper cent and 0.04 per cent respectively.43\nMMC also offers other potential benefits, including:\n• Sustainability through minimal material wastage, use of low carbon materials and environmentally conscious\ndesigns (prefabAUS n.d., pp. 25–26).\n• Imposing less disruptions on neighbourhoods in infill locations by being on-site for significantly less time and\nproducing less noise, even allowing for night work (Evans-Greenwood et al. 2019, p. 8).\nAdoption of MMC faces several challenges\nMMC faces several challenges to its adoption. A producer of MMC products stated:\nDifferences in planning approvals, building codes, and procurement practices across jurisdictions\noften mean MMC projects are assessed through a traditional lens, disadvantaging innovation.\n(Modscape & Modbotics, sub. 4, p. 2)\nWhile these challenges may be significant and could slow more widespread uptake, it is important to understand\nthe underlying causes of each barrier in order to assess if there is a role for government intervention.\n42 For example, multiple buildings being produced in one location saves specialist trades contractors travelling to different sites,\nand MMC suppliers can manage inhouse inventories requisite to planned/projected production.\n43 The PC notes that benefits will not be strictly additive as the residential and non-residential sectors compete for labour and\nresources.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 207", "text_len": 4169, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Financial institutions have often been cautious about funding MMC projects,\nstemming from unfamiliarity with the processes, perceived higher risks compared to conventional builds, and\npayment schedules that differ from on-site construction. For conventional construction, lenders usually provide\nprogress payments at key stages such as excavation, frame, truss or roof installation. For prefab and modular\nconstruction, finance is typically required upfront. Few companies can take on the associated financial risks, such as\nshort-term cash flow constraints or insurance coverage costs (Housing Industry Association, sub. 32, p. 14). While\nthese financial hurdles may create barriers for MMC, these do not constitute an obvious market failure and may\nsimply represent the higher risk faced by financers.\nMMC also encounters several market challenges. For MMC techniques to offer cost savings to consumers,\nprefabricated and modular manufacturing firms need sufficient volume to reach economies of scale (Bertram et al.\n2019, p. 23). This volume is mainly driven by consumer demand which is still low.\nIf volume is achieved, efficient value chain management will be crucial to ensure arrival of components align with\nconstruction schedules. Supply chains for MMC components and systems are often less developed than those for\nconventional materials (Zhang et al. 2024, p. 2).\nTransportation of components can face size and weight restrictions, particularly for larger volumetric modules in\ninner city locations. In remote locations where MMC has the potential to rapidly deliver housing despite skilled\nworker shortages or after major weather events, difficult terrain and a lack of appropriate infrastructure can make\ndelivery of components too complicated and costly to be feasible.\nAlong with these challenges, is entering a sector that can struggle to cope with innovation:\nThere is a favouring of conservative approaches (“do things the way they have always been done”)\ndue to a lack of cross-project knowledge sharing and little perceived gain from innovation on a\nsingle project. (Queensland Major Contractors Association, sub. 66, p. 37)\nResistance also arises from a perception that new techniques might replace demand for the services of the existing\nworkforce (PC 2025, p. 30).\nWhile these market challenges no doubt act as inhibitors on the uptake of MMC, these challenges appear to be\ncommon to most emerging technologies.\nRegulation can be an inhibitor to innovation, including MMC\nRegulatory settings can have a substantial influence on whether firms in an industry adopt innovative methods, can\nmake innovative methods unnecessarily expensive or difficult to access. Regulators and industry alike have\nexperienced challenges in recognising and facilitating emerging methods under existing regulatory frameworks.\nRegulation from all levels of government dictate how a house can be built, where it can be built, and what it should\nlook like. These regulatory requirements lead to a significant focus on ensuring work is compliant while also\nensuring it is finalised on time and within budget. The risk of trying innovative techniques while trying to balance\nthese priorities is generally too high for many builders (PC 2025a, pp. 31–32).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 208", "text_len": 3854, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Changing goal posts create uncertainty and fear that new\napproaches will be rapidly out of step with new requirements (PC 2025a, p. 5). In their submission, the Green\nBuilding Council of Australia (sub. 65, p. 5) stated that:\nEach departure from an agreed compliance trajectory undermines prior investments, slows the\nuptake of innovative systems developed to meet new standards, and erodes investor and workforce\nconfidence.\nThe National Construction Code (NCC) and the standards it references are typically tailored towards conventional\nconstruction methods and lack a clear, standard definition for what constitutes MMC. While the NCC provides\nsome flexibility for how requirements are met — providing a range of deemed to satisfy provisions and\nperformance measures — neither provide clear direction for innovative construction methods. This can create\ninconsistency in approaches and uncertainty in approvals (HIA 2022b, pp. 40–41).\nThe current planning and approval processes also don't always provide a good fit for off-site construction. Like the\nNCC, planning regulations are developed with on-site construction in mind and are overseen by local governments\neach with significantly different regulations and design rules. This can include requirements that prevent the use of\nbuilding materials or construction methods that are suited to offsite construction and transport (HIA 2022b, pp.\n31–34). A lack of harmonisation across jurisdictions is also inhibiting the ability of modular builders to achieve scale\n(Amplify, sub. 40, p. 2) or standardise components.\nStaged inspection and approval processes can also create a barrier. For instance, inspections are required on-site at\ncertain steps during the construction process, such as completion of the framing work. For complex building\nproducts, approval is done at the end after the product has been built, risking issues with compliance approval.\nThis is particularly problematic where parts associated with the structure, such as fire protection, plumbing and\nelectrical components are hidden and difficult to assess. While this differs depending on the degree of\nprefabrication, manufacturers and builders can be reluctant to take on additional risk (HIA 2022b). Assembly can\nalso occur so quickly that it is difficult for quantity surveying to take place on the construction site (Evans-\nGreenwood et al. 2019, p. 8).\nPrefabricated and modular building components often face slow, challenging and costly certification processes.\nThe NCC and Australian Standards generally require individual elements to be tested against specific tests, rather\nthan a complete assembly. This means modular/prefabricated components will often need multiple tests rather\nthan assessing holistic performance. For example, when certifying MMC building components through the non-\nmandatory CodeMark Australia Scheme, there are difficulties in determining what performance requirements need\nto be assessed and how qualitative conformance requirements can be demonstrated. This is complicated further by\ninsufficient technical expertise and testing facilities (HIA 2022b).\nGovernment should focus on removing regulatory barriers\nWhile there are many issues facing MMC that may be critical to its success, such as supply chain integration,\nfinance and customer familiarity, they do not appear to be the result of clear market failures. As such, there does\nnot appear to be a strong rationale for direct government intervention. Rather, many of the challenges associated\nwith MMC are typical of nascent products or technologies that are attempting to disrupt entrenched players in\nexisting markets.\nThere are already indications that the market is beginning to embrace MMC by addressing some of these market\nchallenges. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) recently partnered with prefabAUS to simplify the process\nof buying prefabricated housing and alleviate some of the financial barriers. They will enable customers to access\nprogress payments of up to 60 per cent (or 80 per cent for an accredited CBA prefab manufacturer) of the contract\nprice prior to the building being affixed on the land. Previously, customers had to fund up to 90 per cent of the\nupfront costs (CBA 2025). In November 2024, banks, superannuation funds and other institutional investors agreed\nto work together to address financial barriers to MMC (Husic 2024).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 209", "text_len": 4612, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For example, material suppliers\nstarting or acquiring prefab and modular businesses (PC 2025a, p. 27).\nHowever, there are significant regulatory hurdles that are preventing more common use of MMC. Given the\npotential for MMC to drive productivity growth in constructions, there is a strong prima facie case for reviewing\nregulatory settings to identify and remove unnecessary barriers to more widespread adoption of MMC.\nHowever, it is important that government does not 'pick winners' and elevate MMC over other forms of\nconstruction, including by removing regulations that are necessary or apply to other parts of the industry. Rather\nthe focus should be on removing unnecessary barriers that unduly penalise MMC over conventional construction\nmethods, with the aim of creating a level playing field and technology neutral regulatory approaches.\nBox 14.2 Government action to support modern methods of construction (MMC)\nThe Queensland Government has undertaken several initiatives to support prefab and modular\nconstruction. These include:\n• QBuild providing support for research, development, and training using MMC techniques, and\ndeveloping standardised designs as reference models aligned with the National Construction Code\n(NCC) 2022 and Modern Home Standards\n• committing to 50 per cent of the infrastructure pipeline to incorporate elements of modular\nconstruction by 2030 (DSDIP 2024a)\n• an additional 600 modular social homes by December 2025 (PC 2025).\nAt the national level, the Australian, state and territory governments, under the revitalisation of the\nNational Competition Policy (NCP), committed to removing barriers to MMC. The following measures\nhave been incorporated into the NCP reform agenda:\n• legislating consistent national definitions of MMC\n• a national voluntary manufacturer certification scheme\n• providing ‘regulatory neutrality’ between MMC and conventional construction methods in both\ngovernment planning schemes and consumer protection legislation (Commonwealth Treasury 2024).\nTo support these reforms, the Australian Government has offered state and territory governments a share\nin $120 million to incentivise the removal of barriers (Australian Government 2025a).\nIn 2019 the Australian Government provided $2 million to the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre to\nestablish the Prefab Innovation Hub. The Hub supports the manufacturing sector’s adoption of new\ninnovations and increased industry and researcher collaboration (AMGC 2020).\nThe Australian Building Codes Board (ABCB) has considered how MMC's compliance with the NCC could\nwork better under the Building Product Registration Scheme. It suggested jurisdictions work with their\nconformance assessment bodies to identify applicable reference products to compare with prefabricated\nand modular components to aid assessment, reducing regulatory uncertainty (ABCB 2024b).\nIn October 2024 the ABCB published a Prefabricated, modular and offsite construction Handbook to act as\na guide in applying the NCC to prefab and modular buildings.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 210\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | Box 14.2 Government action to support modern methods of construction (MMC) |  | \n |  | The Queensland Government has undertaken several initiatives to support prefab and modular |  | \n |  | construction.

However, these options provide explicit or implicit subsidies to the industry, and as such require a\nstrong rationale.\nFor example, government procurement should be technology neutral, and outcomes focused — by encouraging\none technology over another, this can work against innovation and increase costs. However, as discussed in Part A\nof this report, there are likely to be benefits from reframing procurement policies to remove any barriers to\ninnovation, including MMC.\nIt is generally accepted that government should support education and upskilling to improve productivity and the\nQueensland Government provide significant support for skilling in trades. However, skills shortages are not unique\nto the construction industry or in prefab and modular production. Therefore, incentivising workers into the industry\nmay come at the cost of other segments of the economy.\nGovernment should focus on removing unnecessary regulatory barriers\nAnother solution consistently raised by stakeholders is the removal of regulatory barriers, particularly where they\nfavour on-site construction as a result of their design or execution.\nThe Queensland Government should follow through on its commitments to the revitalised National Competition\nPolicy (NCP) reform agenda. While Queensland is a signatory, state and territory governments are given discretion\non how or if these reform proposals are adopted. Queensland should consider the costs and benefits of each\nreform.\nProviding clear, consistent definitions of MMC within the framework of the NCC could allow regulators, builders,\nand financiers to align their expectations, and reduce uncertainty (HIA 2022b). It is likely that greater harmonisation\nacross jurisdictions would enable suppliers to drive scale into their pipeline by creating a single large market (PC\n2024).\nRegulatory neutrality in planning schemes and consumer protection legislation will allow MMC to compete with\nother construction methods on a level footing. This means including consistent definitions, removing or providing\nalternatives to rules that impose unnecessarily barriers and acknowledging MMC as a building technique (HIA\n2022b, p. 49).\nSome stakeholders have suggested a moratorium on regulatory changes is needed to enable innovative\ntechniques, including MMC, to adapt to regulatory settings and build scale.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 211", "text_len": 2960, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

All stakeholders reinforced the importance of safety, but suggested workplace health and safety\nresponses are not proportionate to risk, with examples provided of entire worksites being shut down over isolated\ninstances, or being enacted as cover to achieve other industrial outcomes.\nWork Health and Safety regulation is an area that has become increasingly weaponised by certain\nunion officials and it is being used to achieve industry outcomes that have no relationship to the\nhealth and safety of workers.

For\nexample, in the absence of a WHS duty, an employer may require certain work practices or deadlines that result in\nriskier behaviour or ignore certain hazards altogether. Employers often have a greater ability than employees to\nminimise such risks.\nThere are also costs imposed on the broader community from workplace death and injury in the form of costs to\nthe health care system, impact on families and lost productivity (Industry Commission 1995). Workplace Health and\nSafety Queensland (WSHQ) notes that the economic costs to Queensland from work-related fatalities, injuries and\nillnesses is estimated to be over $4.5 billion annually (WHSQ 2024).\nThis rationale has particular application to the building and construction industry given it is inherently less safe\nthan many other industries (Box 15.2).\nBox 15.2 Construction safety statistics\nThe construction industry had the highest number of fatalities and the second highest number of serious\ninjuries in 2022-23. Activities typically occur on sites with a high degree of variability making them hard\nto control perfectly. According to Safe Work Australia, in Queensland between 2018-19 and 2022-23\nthere were on average:\n• 2.3 fatalities per 100,000 construction workers, higher than the all-industry average of 1.6 fatalities.\n• 10.0 serious worker compensation claims per 1 million working hours in the construction industry,\nhigher than the all-industry average of 7.9.\nSource: Safe Work Australia 2025a, n.d.\nNotwithstanding this rationale, there is some alignment of the incentives for employers and workers to minimise\nhealth and safety risk. For example, while workers have an obvious incentive to avoid injury, employers also have\nstrong incentives to avoid workers being injured since they involve significant costs to the firm, including lost\nproductivity, and risk of litigation and industrial action. However, successful management of these issues also\nrequires a 'culture of care' and full participation of an informed workforce (Industry Commission, 1995).\nBox 15.3 WHS and productivity\nIndustries that are the most dangerous, such as construction, have the most to gain by better managing\nWHS risks. WHS regimes can impact productivity in two ways:\n• where they improve WHS outcomes, productivity will be improved through less worker downtime due\nto poor health or injury. A Deloitte report (2022) commissioned by Safe Work Australia, estimates that\nwere work-related injuries and illnesses removed, through productivity gains, wages would rise by 1.3\nper cent per year on average. Deloitte (2022) also estimates that in the absence of any new work-\nrelated injuries or illnesses over 2008-18, on average Australia’s economy would have been $28.6\nbillion larger each year ($4.58 billion larger each year in Queensland).\n• where they are unnecessarily restrictive, duplicative or create perverse incentives because they poorly\nallocate risk, regulations can impose excess burdens on construction firms, which will reduce\nproductivity.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 215\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | Box 15.2 Construction safety statistics |  | \n |  | The construction industry had the highest number of fatalities and the second highest number of serious |  | \n |  | injuries in 2022-23.

This means designing and implementing policies that reduce\nworkplace risks and injuries (that is, are effective) while minimising unnecessary costs to businesses and society.\nWHS frameworks are more likely to operate effectively and efficiently when regulatory provisions:\n• are demonstrated to be necessary to reduce health and safety risks\n• are evidence based, including using data and feedback to evaluate and refine policies and improve effectiveness\nover time\n• are proportional to the health and safety risks the regulation seeks to address, considering the costs involved\n• are clear and easy to follow for businesses to comply with\n• provide flexibility to duty holders to adopt approaches suited to their circumstances, by focussing more on\ndesired outcomes rather than prescriptive methods of compliance\n• provide for joint management of safety by managers and workers, with aligned incentives (Industry Commission\n1995; Safe Work Australia 2014).\nFurther, the actions and behaviour of the regulator is also an important determinant of good practice. Key issues\ninclude whether the regulator is:\n• appropriately resourced to carry out its activities\n• incentivised to respond proportionately to workplace incidents or risks\n• sufficiently experienced or competent to carry out its duties effectively.\nRegulatory burdens seem to be growing\nCompliance burdens seem to be growing\nWHS regulations impose costs on businesses through administrative and compliance burdens related to\ninformation returns, hazard identification, risk management plans and other record keeping obligations. WHS\nregulations also require businesses to invest in systems and equipment, and devise processes, to manage risks in\ntheir workplace. There are also costs in engaging with regulators through their compliance and enforcement\nactivities.\nAccording to the Business Chamber Queensland (formerly CCIQ), Queensland businesses are reporting an\nincreased compliance burden. A 2017 survey conducted by CCIQ reported that 'dealing with WHS regulation and\nregulators' was the second biggest 'red tape imposition' for respondents – with 27 per cent indicating a 'high' level\nof burden (CCIQ 2017, p. 14). By 2023, the proportion of respondents reporting a ‘high’ level of burden had risen\nto 38 per cent (BCQ 2023, p. 19).\nWhile information on specific examples of regulatory burden is limited, stakeholders, across a range of sectors,\nhave expressed concern with the costs incurred in complying with WHS. Small businesses, which make up a large\nproportion of the construction industry, are often significantly affected as a result of their limited resources and\nexpertise (Seyfarth Shaw 2018).\nStakeholder comments made to the 2018 Boland Review of the Model WHS Laws also raised concerns about the\ncomplexity and cost of complying with WHS regulatory regimes. This feedback indicated that the length and\nstructure of the Model WHS Laws made it difficult for some businesses to determine what applied and how it\nneeded to be carried out. Concerns were also raised about how the number of Codes of Practice causes confusion\namong businesses, with the Australian Federation of Employers and Industries stating that ‘when the guidance\nmaterial is more complex to follow than the Act and regulations, there is a problem’ (Australian Federation of\nEmployers and Industries 2018, p. 27).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 216", "text_len": 3760, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For example, Master Builders Queensland has previously stated\nthat some administrative processes (for example, related to safety management plans) appear to be more focused\non 'ticking a box' and that ‘often more time is spent writing these documents than actually taking time to properly\nunderstand the risks on site and control them in the most effective way’ (Master Builders Queensland 2017c, p. 11).\nStakeholders have also noted that there are regulatory requirements that result in duplicate reporting of workplace\nsafety incidents to both Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC) and WHSQ (National Electrical\nand Communication Association, sub. 41, p. 5; Master Builders Queensland, sub. 43, p. 34). The Queensland\nGovernment has committed to remove this duplication through the recently introduced Queensland Building and\nConstruction Commission and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2025 (Queensland Government 2025c).\nRegulations are subject to frequent change\nSince the development of the Model WHS Laws and the commencement of the WHS Act, there have been\nnumerous changes made to WHS regulations in Queensland. While some of these changes are because of national\nreviews of the Model WHS Laws, many have also been progressed unilaterally — resulting in a number of\nQueensland-specific WHS provisions.\nThis is contrary to the aims of the original Model Laws to facilitate a consistent national approach to reduce\ncompliance and administration costs for both businesses operating in multiple jurisdictions (quantified in 2011 at\n$31 million for Queensland businesses) and governments in reducing duplication of effort in reviewing legislation\nand guidance materials (Queensland Parliament 2011; Safe Work Australia 2014; Seyfarth Shaw 2018).\nMany of the recent regulatory changes seem to have resulted in a more stringent WHS regulatory environment.\nKey safety provisions do not appear to be operating effectively\nA key feature of both the Model Laws and the WHS Act is the role of ‘health and safety representatives’ (HSRs) in\nthe workplace and the right for WHS entry permit holders to enter workplaces. Under the original 2011 legislative\nprovisions:\n• ‘Appropriately trained’ HSRs are able to direct workers, in their work group, to cease ‘unsafe work.’\n• A HSR may, in exercising a power or performing a function, whenever necessary, ‘request the assistance of any\nperson’. This allows a person assisting a HSR (provided they have not had a WHS entry permit suspended or\nrevoked or been disqualified) “to have access to the workplace if that is necessary to enable the assistance to be\nprovided.”\n• WHS entry permit holders are required to provide notice ‘as soon as is reasonably practicable after entering a\nworkplace’ for the purpose of inquiring into a suspected contravention of the Act that relates to, or affects, a\nrelevant worker.\nSince this time, these provisions have been amended on multiple occasions and been the subject of ongoing\ndisagreement between stakeholders representing both employers and employees. Current provisions, reflecting\nchanges last made to the Act in late 202444:\n• Provide HSRs to direct workers to cease work, after giving a ‘cease work notice’ to workers and the PCBU\n• Allow an HSR to accompany a WHS permit holder and request the assistance of a ‘suitable entity’ for the HSR\n(e.g. a union that is relevant to that worker.

However, there has been concern from\nindustry stakeholders that these powers, intended to protect safety on worksites, have allowed HSRs considerable\npower and influence. For example, stakeholders contend that stop work notices have been used spuriously to\nfurther industrial aims unrelated to safety.\nSeveral stakeholders have provided case studies and examples of instances where the identification of, in their\nview, minor workplace health risks or incidents, localised to particular areas, have resulted in disproportionate\nresponses, including site-wide shutdowns or toolbox meetings being held across multiple construction sites. As\nnoted by Master Plumbers Queensland:\n… in some instances, localised issues, in a confined area have led to full-site shutdowns. The\nresponse to these incidents can vary significantly between sites, often influenced by differing site\nmanagement practices or industrial environments (Master Plumbers Association Queensland, sub.\n62, p. 1).\nWhere minor WHS matters are not resolved quickly or responses are disproportionate to the issue, they can\ndisrupt time sensitive activities and critical works such as concrete pours, beam lifts and road closures, derailing\nscheduling and causing further delays down the line, with significant impacts on productivity (Australian\nConstructors Association, sub. 39).\nConcerningly, stakeholders have noted concerns about raising WHS matters in a constructive way, with allegations\nof intimidation meaning members of the workforce (including sub-contractors) are fearful to raise concerns about\nhow WHS matters are being dealt with (by both unions and builders) on many construction sites.\nStakeholders were also concerned with what they saw was a ‘lack of action’ by health and safety regulators in\nenforcing relevant provisions, potentially due to lack of resources or gaps in the WHS Act.\nSafety outcomes have not improved\nDespite the apparent increased regulatory burden, there does not appear to have been a significant improvement\nin outcomes over recent years.

The Australian Constructors Association\nconcludes that:\nOne way to solve this structural labour shortage is to divert increasing numbers of workers from\nother industries or demographic segments into construction … at the whole-of-economy level, this\nis a zero-sum game. The reality is that construction must come to terms with a future of relatively\nfewer workers in the face of a relentless increase in the demand for built environment assets … The\nonly sustainable path through this future is productivity growth. (Australian Constructors\nAssociation, sub. 39, pp. 7-9)\nIn the face of both immediate pressures and growing structural pressures, multiple ways to increase the\nproductivity of the construction workforce may need to be considered.\nThis part of the report will consider labour market issues in the Queensland construction industry to the extent that\nthey are impacting productivity, where the Queensland Government can influence outcomes and where there may\nbe significant opportunities for reform. Guided by stakeholder input and evidence from recent studies and reports,\nthis part prioritises the examination of four policy areas to improve the capacity, capability and flexibility of the\nstate’s construction workforce:\n• Apprenticeship and training pathways — to produce a pipeline of future workers with the right mix of\nappropriately skilled workers for the construction industry, and to assist in efficient matching of workers to\nemployers.\n• Occupational licensing — to ensure that licensing requirements are ‘fit-for-purpose’ and do not create\nunnecessary barriers of entry into the Queensland construction workforce for local or interstate workers, while\nproviding safeguards to ensure work is undertaken with appropriate skill and care.\n• Skilled overseas migration — to draw from international labour markets to fill skills gaps in the state’s\nconstruction workforce that cannot be adequately addressed by local recruitment.\n• Labour hire licensing — to improve flexibility to the Queensland construction workforce so it can better meet\nconstruction work demands, while ensuring workers are protected.\nThis part of the report complements other chapters that investigate issues that can improve labour productivity in\nthe construction industry and construction productivity more generally.\nHow labour force policy settings can affect productivity\nLabour market settings are important for this inquiry where they materially affect productivity in the construction\nindustry. In this context, generalised labour shortages are usually not in scope because, while they affect output,\nthey may not, in themselves, affect labour productivity. Specific labour shortages, however, can affect productivity\nwhere shortages in one area prevent the efficient sequencing of activity. Similarly, labour markets that do not\nmatch skills to need or that fail to adequately skill the workforce can cause project delays, produce work defects or\ninhibit innovation, all potentially resulting in lower productivity.\nGovernment can influence labour markets through its policy settings. However, there must be a strong rationale\nfor doing so and the benefit should outweigh the cost of government intervention. For example, where a market\nfailure prevents the efficient matching of workers and jobs, there may be a role for government to play in\naddressing the market failure if the benefit in doing so outweighs the cost.\nAn important consideration is the impact of labour market policy on construction productivity, which can be\npositive or negative (Figure D.2).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 226", "text_len": 3812, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

In these cases, better social outcomes and economic (including productivity)\noutcomes can often complement each other, and sometimes there can be trade-offs. For example, improving\nworkers’ health and safety can boost labour productivity, but sometimes a safer workplace necessarily requires\nmore cautious work practices, which may reduce labour productivity, at least in the immediate term.\nGood policy process can help ensure the best outcomes are achieved for the community. This includes clear\nspecification and robust analysis of the policy problem, identification of policy options (including non-regulatory\nand no-change options), rigorous use of cost–benefit, or similar, analysis and community consultation to identify\nthe impacts and implications of options to inform government in their decision-making.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 227", "text_len": 2674, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Traineeships are typically shorter in duration (one to two years) but still\ninvolve a combination of on-the-job work experience and off-the-job training (Naidu & Frazer 2024, p. 55). Off-\nthe-job training is offered by a range of providers, predominantly Technical and Further Education (TAFE) and\nregistered training organisations (RTOs), which consist of private and industry not-for-profit operating models. The\nuniversity sector also supports skills requirements in the construction industry, but it accounts for only a small\nshare of overall VET delivery (PC 2020b, p. 5).\nThis section focuses on the trades-related rather than the university system given the apprenticeship and VET\nsystems’ greater contribution to construction-related training, the limited policy leverage of state governments\nover the university system, and the emphasis placed on the apprenticeship and VET system by stakeholders during\nconsultation.\nHowever, the role of the university sector in the functioning of the construction industry should not be\nunderestimated. Universities train important sections of the construction workforce, such as engineers, surveyors\nand other professionals – shortages and deficiencies in these occupations can impede the operation of the broader\nconstruction industry. Moreover, universities have a role in supporting innovation, both through their education of\nskilled professionals in the latest technological and other developments, and through their research function.\nApprentices and trainees can be placed with a single employer or be employed by a group training organisation\n(GTO). GTOs place apprentices and trainees with one or more host employers, who are responsible for on-the-job\ntraining and work experience, while GTOs are responsible for organising off-the-job training, handling recruitment,\narranging job rotations and managing payroll. Such arrangements are typically beneficial for small and medium-\nsized employers, who may not have the capacity to provide these support services.\nResponsibility for training and apprenticeship policy in Queensland is shared between the Australian and\nQueensland governments. In Queensland, the Further Education and Training Act 2014 regulates RTOs and GTOs,\nprovides for training contracts between apprentices and employers, and determines which qualifications can be\ncompleted as apprenticeships and traineeships. RTOs are also regulated by the Australian Skills Quality Authority.\nIn its 2020 review of the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development, the Australian Productivity\nCommission did not find “evidence of a VET system in crisis” (PC 2020b, p. 2). However, it did find that there were\nopportunities to lift participation and improve training quality. Changes to VET qualifications design have\nsubsequently been agreed by Australian Skills Ministers (Box 16.1). The Australian Productivity Commission also\nrecommended that reform efforts should be focused on improving completion rates through more screening and\nmatching of prospective apprentices, and by aligning the timing of employer incentives with periods where the risk\nof cancellation is highest (PC 2020b, p. 28). Although the Australian Productivity Commission’s commentary was at\nthe national level and not confined to the building and construction industry, stakeholders have raised similar\nissues in their submissions to this inquiry.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 229", "text_len": 4560, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The leading causes of dissatisfaction arose\nfrom programs that did not teach relevant skills or were not sufficiently focused on practical skills. A recent\nnational survey of 999 apprentices and trainees in construction trades found that 96 per cent were employed after\ncompleting their training, with 93 per cent improving their employment status. Ninety-four per cent reported that\nthey were satisfied with skills learnt on-the-job, while 89 per cent were satisfied with off-the-job training (NCVER\n2025).\nRecent trends in apprenticeships in Queensland\nAs of September 2024, there were approximately 50 per cent more construction apprentices in-training in\nQueensland compared to four years prior (Figure 16.1). This growth has been driven by Covid-era initiatives such\nas the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements (BAC) and Completing Apprenticeship Commencements (CAC)\nschemes (DEWR 2023b),46 which led to 80 per cent more commencements during their operation compared to the\ntwo-year period prior to their introduction. While commencements have fallen in the two years since the BAC and\nCAC schemes closed, there were still 40 per cent more commencements than in the two years prior to their\nintroduction.\nAs discussed in Part A on procurement, apprenticeship numbers may also be influenced by the currently\nsuspended Best Practice Industry Conditions (BPICs) and the Queensland Government Building and Construction\nTraining Policy, which mandates that 15 per cent of hours worked on large government projects must be\nundertaken by apprentices and trainees. However, it is unclear how effective and efficient they have been in\nincreasing net apprenticeship numbers.\nAlthough the number of apprentices in-training has risen since the BAC and CAC schemes were introduced,\nwithdrawals have significantly outpaced completions since 2021. However, as apprenticeships typically take up to\nfour years to complete, it is anticipated that the commencements throughout 2021 and 2022 should lead to higher\ncompletions throughout 2025 and 2026.\n46 The Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements and Completing Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy schemes\nopened on 5 October 2020 and closed on 30 June 2022.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 230\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | Box 16.1 Recent training system reforms |  | \n |  | In December 2024, Australian Skills Ministers endorsed a new approach to vocational education and |  | \n |  | training (VET) qualifications design aimed at improving quality and reducing complexity (DEWR 2024a). |  | \n |  | While made in the context of the entire training system, the reforms have potential implications for |  | \n |  | training and development in the construction industry: |  | \n |  | • transitioning from the traditional “unit-first” approach to a “qualification-first” approach, whereby the |  | \n |  | emphasis is on designing a coherent portfolio of knowledge and skills, rather than packaging |  | \n |  | competency units that attempt to reflect all functions and tasks |  | \n |  | • allowing qualification developers to better describe job functions and tasks or knowledge and skills |  | \n |  | outcomes to promote adaptability |  | \n |  | • consistently embedding foundation skills (language, literacy, numeracy and digital literacy - LLND) as a |  | \n |  | holistic outcome of a qualification, rather than as a narrow component of every individual unit of |  | \n |  | competency |  | \n |  | • strengthening principles to underpin VET qualifications development, including drawing on data and |  | \n |  | evidence, removing duplication and unnecessary specification to enable flexible and high-quality |  | \n |  | delivery, and drawing on broad industry and educator expertise when developing qualifications. |  | ", "text_len": 5283, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 234, "text": "Apprenticeships and training pathways\nTaken together, recent trends in apprenticeships appear broadly favourable, both in terms of the number of\napprentices and as a proportion of the building and construction workforce. However, the escalating demand for\nconstruction work as the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games approach and governments’ commitments\nto facilitating higher levels of housing construction in the face of low affordability will place pressure on labour\nsupply.\nWithin this context, turnover is a challenge for the construction industry, with an annual exit rate of 8 per cent\n(Master Builders Australia 2024b, p. 4). Although the average age of workers in construction is lower than the\neconomy average (ACA 2023a, p. 4), construction workers generally exit the industry earlier due to the physical\nrequirements of the work.\nThe Australian Productivity Commission (2025a, p. 38) has found that the age distribution of dwelling construction\nworkers is currently more favourable than for the economy as a whole, but there is still the potential for pressures\nto emerge in specific occupations. The Housing Industry Association (HIA 2024a, p. 12) found that the occupations\nmost susceptible to an ageing workforce were plasterers, bricklayers and floor finishers, and to a lesser extent\nglaziers, tilers, cabinetmakers and painters, due to the decline in the number of workers in these occupations aged\nunder 25. In the white-collar professional occupations, the Australian Institute of Building Surveyors (sub. 49, p. 9)\nestimated that one third of building surveyors are also likely to reach retirement age within the next 10 years. On\nthe other hand, carpenters, electricians and plumbers were considered among the least susceptible to age-related\nexits, as growth had been observed in both the overall size of the workforce as well as the size of the workforce\naged under 25.\nConstruction Skills Queensland (CSQ) (2025b) projects that Queensland will face an average aggregate shortfall of\nmore than 18,000 construction workers per year over the next eight years, peaking at 50,000 in 2026-27. It is likely\nthat shortages will not be spread evenly, with certain occupations likely to experience more intense shortages. CSQ\nprojects demand for construction workers in the building industry over this period to be focused on carpenters\nand joiners, building and plumbing labourers, painting trades workers, plumbers, electricians, concreters, and\nplasterers.\nQueensland faces a challenge to provide a coordinated response that can meet the immediate and growing\ndemand for construction work. In particular, more will be required of the apprenticeship system if labour\nshortages, especially in high demand occupations, are not to become an increasing drag on construction output\nand productivity.\nIssues with the apprenticeship and training system\nThe Australian Productivity Commission has presented a decision-making framework for apprentices and\nemployers for deciding whether to undertake an apprenticeship or take on an apprentice (Table 16.1). A diverse\nrange of considerations factor into these decisions.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 232", "text_len": 3175, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

These issues generally fit across several broad\nthemes:\n• information barriers faced by prospective apprentices and workers\n• deficits in and underutilisation of the existing training system\n• financial barriers facing businesses and workers.\nThese issues and proposals merit a deeper investigation and evaluation than this inquiry can provide. Many require\na rigorous evaluation by those with expertise and experience in the field, while some issues strike at underlying\nproblems with the VET system, and the constraints in which it operates – that is, it is a wide-ranging system,\ninvolving government agencies, many industries, individual businesses, prospective workers and public and private\nemployees. It interacts with school education and labour market regulatory regimes and exists within a federal\narchitecture with responsibilities shared across jurisdictions.\nWith the Queensland Productivity Commission’s (the Commission) inquiry focusing on productivity in the\nconstruction industry, areas have been identified for improvement based on stakeholder feedback.\nProspective workers encounter information barriers\nIncomplete or conflicting information for prospective trainees and apprentices can be an impediment to making\nsound decisions on their training and ultimately to construction productivity. Information barriers can stem from a\ngeneral lack of awareness about what it is like to work in the construction industry, future industry prospects, and\nthe precise training pathways that will best equip them to succeed in the industry. The Australian Productivity\nCommission noted that the mismatch of skills training was in part driven by gaps in information and career advice,\nwhich is often fragmented or duplicated across multiple websites, leading to suboptimal decision making about\ntraining pathways (PC 2020b, p. 12).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 233\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  |  |  | Benefits |  |  | Costs | \nApprentice |  |  | • Desire to work in occupation\n• Improved skills\n• Training wages\n• Future wages\n• Government incentives |  |  | • Training costs incurred by the apprentice\n• Opportunity cost of alternative\nemployment\n• Lack of career information\n• Negative community and individual\nattitudes\n• Rigid structure or length of training and\nwork\n• Risk of problems with employer |  | \nEmployer |  |  | • Productive contribution of apprentice\n• Wage discount\n• Giving back to the community\n• Government incentives |  |  | • Training wages\n• Supervision costs\n• Training costs incurred by the employer\n• Group training fees\n• Administration costs\n• Extra maintenance due to apprentice errors\n• Risk of non-completion\n• Risk of poaching |  | ", "text_len": 3693, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

While the review found that the system was not in need of major systemic changes, it did\nrecommend reforms to better prepare and support employers, apprentices and trainees throughout\ntraining contracts in order to narrow the gap in completion rates between male and female apprentices.\nThe review found that females accounted for around 4 per cent of construction apprenticeship\ncommencements and were less likely than males to complete their apprenticeship. On the other hand,\nfemales were more likely than males to complete a construction traineeship, despite representing only\n11 per cent of total construction traineeships.\nThese trends in apprenticeships and traineeships are also reflected in longer-term career outcomes. There\nwere 46,000 females working in the Queensland construction industry in 2024, a 16 per cent increase\nfrom 2023 (CSQ 2024a, p. 9).

In Queensland, initiatives such as CSQ’s Year13 seek to counter these problems by\nproviding tools for high school students to investigate their compatibility with the choice of careers in construction\n(CSQ 2024b, p. 19).\nStrategies to reduce information barriers can be both formal and informal in their design. Stakeholders\nrecommended the introduction of readiness assessments for prospective apprentices to ensure that candidates\npossess sufficient motivation, literacy and numeracy skills, practical dexterity, and understanding of the trade\nenvironment to commence and complete an apprenticeship (NECA, sub. 27, p. 10). This could help to counter high\nattrition rates and avoid wasted time and resources for both industry and candidates, increasing employer\nconfidence when engaging new apprentices. This process could also interact with mentoring strategies by\nidentifying individual learning or support needs at the outset, enabling targeted intervention and tailored support\nplans.\nMeasures to retain apprentices\nInformation barriers are not confined to the initial decision to enter training for the construction labour market.\nApprentices and trainees also benefit from support and access to information during their placement to ensure\nthey have a clear view of their progress and remain in touch with industry networks.\nStakeholders pointed to evidence showing that structured, industry-specific mentoring is among the most effective\ninterventions to increase retention, completion, and overall apprentice wellbeing, especially for mature-age\napprentices, women, First Nations people, and other priority cohorts (HIA, sub. 32, p. 23; NECA, sub. 27, p. 10). An\neffective mentoring system consists of regular scheduled check-ins, clear escalation pathways for workplace or\npersonal issues, and access to trained mentors with direct experience in the given trade.\nSeveral stakeholders emphasised the effectiveness of GTOs for improving recruitment, retention, and completion\nrates for apprentices in the trades. GTOs allow apprentices and trainees to spend their entire apprenticeship or\ntraineeship with a single host employer or to rotate across several host employers. This can increase flexibility for\nemployers who may not be in a position to support an apprentice or trainee for the full term of their\napprenticeship or traineeship.\nSmall businesses tend not to have the necessary experience and resources to provide apprentices with\ncomprehensive mentoring and support, with inconsistent work and host turnover raising barriers to completion\n(Queensland Unions, sub. 59, p. 26). GTOs can address this gap by ensuring that apprentices are matched with host\nemployers based on their skills and potential for success (NECA, sub. 27, p. 8). GTOs can also bolster job security by\nhelping to smooth boom-bust workforce cycles. If a business faces financial difficulties or ceases operations, GTOs\ncan intervene to secure alternative placements for the business’s apprentices (Plumbing Industry Climate Action\nGroup, sub. 56, p. 6).\nStakeholder submissions have highlighted the potential for significant productivity gains from engaging cohorts\nthat are currently underrepresented in the construction industry. Although stakeholders have pointed to successful\npilots and other localised projects, improving productivity at an industry level will require solutions to be deployed\nat scale across wide geographical areas while retaining the personalisation that makes mentoring and\npre-apprenticeship support mechanisms effective. Policies designed to reduce information barriers for employees\nand employers may not require substantial financial resources but do need to be coordinated to avoid duplication\nand confusion about potential pathways and opportunities. High quality evaluations of the efficacy of these\nprograms will be required to inform decisions on their adoption.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 235", "text_len": 4237, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

However, their effectiveness in supporting construction productivity\nis dependent on attracting a pipeline of qualified educators and ensuring that capacity is matched to demand\nacross the state. Jobs and Skills Australia reported shortages of VET teachers in every Australian jurisdiction, with\nshortages particularly acute for teachers, trainers and assessors in building and engineering trades (Jobs and Skills\nAustralia 2024, p. 110).\nSeveral stakeholders have drawn attention to challenges with RTOs and TAFEs attracting and retaining qualified\ntrainers and assessors in specialised fields (PICAG, sub. 56, p. 8). For example, several stakeholders noted that there\nis limited RTO capacity for some qualifications and in some regions in Queensland. Fire Protection Association\nAustralia (FPAA, sub. 23, p. 1) noted that the Certificate IV in Fire Systems Compliance is only offered in full by two\nRTOs in Queensland, resulting in only 45 course completions across 2022 and 2023.\nIn order to remain fit-for-purpose, training pathways must stay up-to-date with the evolving requirements of\nemployers and the building and construction industry generally. Stakeholders raised concerns that some\nqualifications are not sufficiently responsive and can lag behind current industry practices, technological\nadvancements, and the evolving complexity of fire safety, electrical, and mechanical systems (AMCA, NECA and\nNFIA, sub. 47, p. 4). Not only does this necessitate additional training by employers to address these shortfalls, but\nup-to-date training in modern construction practices is essential to reduce the risk of building defects (Australian\nSustainable Built Environment Council, sub. 58, p. 2).\nSome stakeholders also suggested that existing capacity is not being used as effectively as it could be:\n• The National Electrical and Communications Association (NECA, sub. 27, p. 9) reported that several public TAFE\nfacilities and other Government-owned buildings in Brisbane and regional centres are considerably\nunderutilised, with the potential for Industry RTOs to use these facilities to deliver qualifications.\n• Some stakeholders also raised concerns that available RTO capacity was not always being utilised productively.\nFor example, electricians could previously complete Authorised Person (AP) requirements for electrical work as\npart of onboarding, but must now complete a dedicated RTO course (MEA, sub. 37, pp. 7-8). Not only does this\nuse up RTO capacity, but limited class intake leads to delays in electricians being able to complete electrical\nwork.\nMeasures to increase training capacity\nStakeholders suggested measures to increase training capacity, including:\n• NECA (sub. 27, p. 9) recommended the adoption of ‘Trade to Trainer’ programs, whereby Industry RTOs deliver\ntraining to assist experienced workers seeking less labour-intensive work, or carer or lifestyle changes, to\ntransition into technical training roles.\n• NECA (sub. 27, p. 9) also noted its ongoing trial of a ‘pop up’ RTO campus model, utilising a community hall as a\ntrade school facility on the NSW South Coast, where it delivers a Certificate III in Electrotechnology - Electrician\ntwo days a week. This has contributed to the employment of nearly 40 new electrical apprentices in fewer than\n12 months. NECA also pointed to the success of a block release training model targeted at organisations with\nfly-in-fly-out models.\n• Stockland (sub. 29, p. 3) is investigating opportunities to collaborate with the TAFE sector to create local Skills\nExchanges to build up a skilled workforce through its own large-scale construction sites.\n• Master Electricians Australia (MEA, sub. 37, pp. 21-22) suggested a greater role for technology in delivering\ntraining. MEA considered that the continued requirement for face-to-face training is a constraint to the\nproductive use of limited qualified trainers and limited physical training facilities. Virtual reality (VR) technology\ncould be adopted (possibly starting with non-accredited training) to deliver training remotely, with the ability to\nvalidate progress and completion.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 236", "text_len": 4409, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This may suggest that some prospective\nconstruction workers are being forced to acquire additional qualifications with limited incremental benefits to their\nskill set, which is likely to place additional pressure on an already constrained training system.\nThe Australian Productivity Commission (2023b, 2025a) has supported consideration of microcredentials in its\nrecent reports, arguing that microcredentials provide an opportunity for workers to quickly obtain specific new\nskills, and can therefore help address acute skills shortages. They are generally cheaper than more formal\neducation, and more likely to be undertaken by the existing workforce, with employers also being more likely to\nfund them.\nStakeholder consultation has highlighted various training offerings, each with strengths and drawbacks as currently\nadopted in the construction industry. Establishing which models are likely to be most effective in addressing\ntraining constraints and how these should be funded is beyond the capacity of this inquiry. Importantly,\nconstruction is not the only industry where training systems are under pressure. As such, it is relevant to bear in\nmind that resources deployed for the construction industry will need to be diverted from other productive uses.\nFinancial barriers may constrain uptake of apprenticeships and training\nTraining for an occupation should be considered an investment with all parties seeking to maximise the return on\nthe resources they have invested under uncertain prospects.\nFrom the perspective of labour market entrants, there are financial costs to efficiently acquire the necessary skills\nand subsequently make themselves available for work in the industry. Financial costs for prospective employees\ninclude not only the direct cost of training, but potentially also the cost of moving, the cost of obtaining relevant\nequipment and the loss of income from entering the training system for those in work. There is also considerable\nuncertainty regarding future wage outcomes, security of work, and job satisfaction relative to other labour market\nopportunities.\nFor employers who invest in training by taking on an apprentice, there is a risk that the apprentice fails to complete\ntheir placement, leading to wasted resources. Even if a placement is completed, employers may miss out on the\nbenefits of the time and resources they invest in an apprentice if they move to a competing firm. For example, in\nthe electrical sector, MEA (sub. 37, pp. 19-21) reported that small businesses are discouraged from taking on\napprentices because they often lose them to larger firms who are able to offer higher wages in the later years of an\napprenticeship – this results in small businesses receiving minimal return on their investment, despite having\ncommitted substantial time and supervision. There may be broader benefits to the worker and the industry from\nthe small business’s investment, but these do not fully accrue to the small business itself.\nConstruction employers face competing demands for the allocation of scarce resources. For instance, time and\nfunds spent dedicated to apprentices and training offerings could be spent on other employees, or on other\nfactors of production (for example, capital equipment). Employers and students in regional areas also face higher\ncosts when students undertake studies at distant university and training campuses, such as accommodation costs\nand the unavailability of students for work.\nMaster Plumbers’ Association Queensland (MPAQ, sub. 62, pp. 2-3) for example, estimates the ‘true’ cost of\ntraining a single apprentice as exceeding $250,000, with only two per cent of this figure covered by government\nfinancial incentives.\nStakeholders pointed to financial barriers to entry for mature apprentices (HIA, sub. 32, pp. 22-23; AMCA, NECA\nand NFIA, sub. 47, p. 6). NECA (sub. 27, p. 7) reported that people over the age of 21 can comprise up to 50 per\ncent of applicants, but constitute less than 5 per cent of NECA Apprenticeships’ annual intake. Adult apprentices\nare more expensive to employ and, hence, more difficult to justify, particularly for small businesses. This wage\nbarrier significantly disadvantages women, who are more likely to pursue a trade career later in life.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 237", "text_len": 4519, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 240, "text": "Apprenticeships and training pathways\nUse of financial incentives and subsidies\nIncentive systems have been one of the strategies used to support training and apprenticeships. The purpose of\nthese incentives is to assist employers when the resources involved with engaging, supervising and training\napprentices are not commensurate with the productivity generated by these employees in the early stages of their\ncareer (Master Builders Queensland, sub. 43, p. 27; DEWR 2024c, p. 53). In the absence of such initiatives,\nworkplaces may not be sufficiently incentivised to engage trainees and apprentices if there is a risk that\napprentices do not complete their apprenticeship or move to another workplace and therefore the returns on the\ninvestments made in training are not realised.\nCommon policy instruments to address financial barriers typically include a range of incentive payments to\nemployees and employers, wage and other subsidies, and tax breaks. A range of incentive schemes already exist at\nthe state and Commonwealth levels (Box 16.3).\nBox 16.3 Government financial incentive schemes\nAs of 1 July 2024, the Australian Apprenticeships Incentive System payments are structured as follows:\n• Employers of apprentices in priority occupations will be eligible to claim up to $5,000 over 2\ninstalments ($2,000 at 6 months and $3,000 at 12 months) using the Priority Hiring Incentive\n• Apprentices in priority occupations can also receive up to $5,000 in 4 instalments over 24 months\nusing the Australian Apprentice Training Support Payment\nQueensland Government incentives and subsidies for apprenticeships and trainees include the following:\n• Contributions to the cost of training for priority apprenticeships and traineeships paid directly to\neligible Skills Assure Suppliers (Queensland Government 2025b)\n• Travel and accommodation allowances paid directly to apprentices and trainees (DTET 2025)\n• Discounted workers’ compensation insurance premiums for apprentices (WorkCover Queensland 2023)\n• 50 per cent rebate on payroll taxes for apprentice and trainee wages (Queensland Revenue Office\n2025)\nBetter targeting of financial incentives and subsidies\nIt is difficult to evaluate the adequacy of these payments and how they contribute to construction productivity\nbased on the information available to the Commission. In its 2020 study, the Australian Productivity Commission’s\nview was that employer incentives are unlikely to provide a strong return on investment, often paying businesses\nfor training that would have occurred anyway, and being likely to change the behaviour of only a few. Instead, they\ncould be better targeted or redirected to other mechanisms that provide a greater return on investment (PC 2020b,\npp. 27–28).\nThe Strategic Review of the Australian Apprenticeship Incentive System made the following recommendations with\nimplications for productivity (DEWR 2024c):\n• direct employer incentives to small and medium employers engaging apprentices in priority locations, by\nremoving employer incentives for large employers. This recommendation was based on evidence that large\nbusinesses are more likely to hire apprentices based on business needs rather than available government\nincentives\n• develop ways to recognise previous experience and fast-track apprenticeships to make them more appealing to\nthose entering an apprenticeship later in life\n• develop means for apprentices to demonstrate the transferability of the skills they develop in their training\nbetween different employers and occupations.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 238\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | Box 16.3 Government financial incentive schemes |  | \n |  | As of 1 July 2024, the Australian Apprenticeships Incentive System payments are structured as follows: |  | \n |  | • Employers of apprentices in priority occupations will be eligible to claim up to $5,000 over 2 |  | \n |  | instalments ($2,000 at 6 months and $3,000 at 12 months) using the Priority Hiring Incentive |  | \n |  | • Apprentices in priority occupations can also receive up to $5,000 in 4 instalments over 24 months |  | \n |  | using the Australian Apprentice Training Support Payment |  | \n |  | Queensland Government incentives and subsidies for apprenticeships and trainees include the following: |  | \n |  | • Contributions to the cost of training for priority apprenticeships and traineeships paid directly to |  | \n |  | eligible Skills Assure Suppliers (Queensland Government 2025b) |  | \n |  | • Travel and accommodation allowances paid directly to apprentices and trainees (DTET 2025) |  | \n |  | • Discounted workers’ compensation insurance premiums for apprentices (WorkCover Queensland 2023) |  | \n |  | • 50 per cent rebate on payroll taxes for apprentice and trainee wages (Queensland Revenue Office |  | \n |  | 2025) |  | ", "text_len": 4813, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

SMEs, especially those who have not taken on an apprentice before, often need additional\nsupport around providing apprentices with training and navigating the apprenticeship system (DEWR 2024c, p. 67).\nLow training wages were also found to deter people from not only taking up an apprenticeship but also impacting\non their ability to afford to follow it through to completion. Master Builders Australia (2024b, p. 34) has\nrecommended adapting the Vocational Education and Training award to allow for more flexible patterns of work\nand part-time apprenticeships.\nMEA (sub. 37, p. 19) recommended that the Queensland Government provide targeted financial support to SME\nbusinesses for training hours spent by a qualified electrical worker supervising an apprentice during the first and\nsecond years when greater direct supervision is required. This funding would help offset the cost of lost\nproductivity from qualified electrical workers who dedicate time to apprentice supervision and could encourage\nmore SMEs to take on first year apprentices despite the risk of losing them as they become more productive.\nSimilarly, in the building industry, Master Builders Queensland (sub. 43, p. 27) has proposed increased apprentice\nwage subsidies for businesses to incentivise commencements and offset high supervisory costs in the first year,\nalong with financial incentives for apprentices upon completion of their first year (when apprentices are most likely\nto drop out), and upon completion of the full apprenticeship.\nNECA (sub. 27, p. 7) noted the success of the Western Australia Construction Training Fund (CTF), which provided\nGTOs with 100 per cent of the wage gap allowing adult apprentices to be engaged at the same rate as junior\napprentices. This resulted in a doubling of female apprentices, suggesting that subsidies may be effective for\nincreasing mature entrants to apprenticeships.\nInvestment in training is more likely to be optimised if those receiving the benefits of that investment are also the\nones making that investment. Underinvestment in training can occur when those required to make the investment\nare not accruing the commensurate benefits of that investment. Conversely, overinvestment can occur if those\nreceiving the benefits of training are deciding on the level of investment but not adequately contributing to it. As\nthe benefits of training can be widely diffused among prospective and existing workers, individual businesses, the\nbroader industry and the general community, contributions to training could come from a number of parties. The\nlevel and quality of training can be affected by how investment decisions are made and funding contributions are\nshared and managed.\nGovernments already provide a range of incentive payments and other forms of support to apprentices and their\nemployers. Nevertheless, stakeholders have argued that there is a need for further industry support. Given the\nproductivity lens of this inquiry, financial subsides are generally not a preferred option since they raise the risk of\ndistorting market outcomes and other unintended consequences. However, to the extent financial support for\nindustry is to be provided, payments could be structured in such way that more apprentices will commence and\ncomplete placements than in the absence of the incentive schemes.\nAny government intervention should be the minimum necessary to alleviate constraints on construction\nproductivity. The building and construction industry is only one of many industries subject to skills shortages. Just\nas under-provision of support can create inefficiencies, so too can overinvestment distort efficient market\noutcomes by diverting funds from more productive uses.\nA way forward on apprenticeship and training reform\nThe issues raised in stakeholder submissions indicate that there may be opportunities to improve the\napprenticeship and training system. Considerations include:\n• CSQ’s analysis suggests that skills shortages are an immediate issue and will increase in the next several years.\nImprovements that have a positive impact on skills acquisition in the short to medium term will be responding\nin the same timeframe of the commensurate need. Issues relating to more deep-seated problems in the\napprenticeship and training system should be addressed, but in some cases that may only be possible in the\nlonger term and through a more comprehensive process.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 239", "text_len": 4612, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Increases in funding will\nrequire development of a rigorous business case, with consideration of other government priorities and the risk\nof creating market distortions and other unintended consequences.\n• The Queensland apprenticeship and training system does not represent the only mechanism by which\nconstruction skills can be developed – industry may consider working outside the existing formal system, or\nusing its expertise to improve or complement training offerings, as Stockland appears to be doing in relation to\nthe creation of local Skills Exchanges.\nThere have been many reviews of the VET system.

Both tradespeople and professionals working in the construction and real estate\nindustries are subject to occupational regulation with requirements that can be complex and diverse (Box 17.1).\nBox 17.1 Occupational licensing requirements in construction and real estate industries\nOccupational licensing requirements impose a variety of conditions, but they most commonly relate to:\n• qualifications — for example, a plumbing and drainage licence requires an applicant to hold a\nCertificate III in plumbing (QBCC 2024b)\n• experience or competency — for example, registration as a professional engineer requires 4–5 years of\nexperience after graduation (BPEQ 2025)\n• continuing professional development (CPD) — for example, from 6 June 2025, a licensed real estate\nagent must complete 2 approved CPD sessions per year (Office of Fair Trading 2025)\n• character or previous conduct — for example, a site supervisor licence cannot obtained by a person\nwho has become bankrupt in the previous 3 years (QBCC 2024a).\nSeveral international studies have linked economy-wide occupational licensing to reduced competition, slower\nproductivity growth, or other costs on the community (for example, Bona 2011; CEDA 2022; Cox & Foster 1990;\nKleiner 2006; Kleiner & Soltas 2019). In Australia, the 'stringency' of occupational entry regulation has been linked\nto lower rates of business entry and exit, slower flows of workers from low to high productivity firms, and skill\nshortages (Bowman et al. 2024). Assessing the evidence on the whole-of-economy impacts of occupational\nlicensing, the Australian Productivity Commission recently concluded that '[m]uch of the available evidence\nsupports the idea that licensing stringency reduces market competition', increases labour market rigidity, creates\nsignificant administrative costs, and lowers productivity (PC 2023a, pp. 60–63).\nThe streamlining of requirements for occupational licensing was one of the 26 reforms modelled by the Australian\nProductivity Commission at the request of the Australian, state and territory governments in 2024 as part of a\nrevitalised National Competition Policy (NCP). The Australian Productivity Commission modelling indicated that\noccupational licensing reform could deliver the greatest economic benefits of those reforms whose benefits could\nbe quantified (PC 2024, p. 14). However, it was not one of the reforms in a first tranche agreed to by treasurers in\nNovember 2024 (Chalmers 2024).\nOccupational licensing should deliver net community benefits\nOccupational licensing can deliver several potential benefits to the community where it addresses a market failure.\nMost occupational licensing requirements generally seek to address market failures relating to:\n• Information asymmetry, which exists where consumers (or employers) cannot accurately assess the competency\nof service providers (or potential employees). This is particularly problematic in relation to where a consumer\nmay not be able to assess competency before or after the fact or where the outcome of poor performance is\nnon-rectifiable (for example, where poorly performed work results in a permanent injury).\n• Negative externalities, which exist where a worker or service provider’s lack of competency adversely affects a\nthird party. The most common example in construction relates to health and safety risks, but other examples of\nexternalities could include nuisances (such as noise or odour), environmental damage (such as from improper\ndisposal of materials) or loss of lateral support on adjacent properties due to improperly completed earthworks.\nHowever, occupational licensing requirements can also impose costs. They can:\n• discourage people from entering or remaining in regulated industries, reducing competition and supply\n• reduce competitive pressure on incumbents to innovate\nQueensland Productivity Commission 243\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | Box 17.1 Occupational licensing requirements in construction and real estate industries |  | \n |  | Occupational licensing requirements impose a variety of conditions, but they most commonly relate to: |  | \n |  | • qualifications — for example, a plumbing and drainage licence requires an applicant to hold a |  | \n |  | Certificate III in plumbing (QBCC 2024b) |  | \n |  | • experience or competency — for example, registration as a professional engineer requires 4–5 years of |  | \n |  | experience after graduation (BPEQ 2025) |  | \n |  | • continuing professional development (CPD) — for example, from 6 June 2025, a licensed real estate |  | \n |  | agent must complete 2 approved CPD sessions per year (Office of Fair Trading 2025) |  | \n |  | • character or previous conduct — for example, a site supervisor licence cannot obtained by a person |  | \n |  | who has become bankrupt in the previous 3 years (QBCC 2024a). |  | ", "text_len": 5023, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This can create or exacerbate skill shortages if highly skilled workers\nare required for tasks that less credentialled workers could adequately perform. While not occupational licensing\nper se, regulation can have a similar effect if, for example, it requires a highly credentialled worker to act as a\nsupervisor or spotter for another worker when a lower qualification level would be suitable or supervision is not\nnecessary.\nMoreover, consideration should be given to whether other policy instruments may be more effective and efficient\nthan occupational licensing in addressing the policy problem.\nOther policy instruments may be more effective and efficient\nEven where market failures exist, market or other non-regulatory mechanisms often suffice to regulate the\ncompetency of service providers or mitigate costs to third parties. For example, information asymmetry can be\naddressed through practitioner reputation, voluntary accreditation or certification, voluntary membership of\nprofessional associations, or standard commercial practice (for example, assigning contract risk through warranties\nor guarantees).\nOther general regulatory interventions also may suffice to address them without the need for specific occupational\nlicensing. These can include consumer law (for examples, the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 includes\nmandatory guarantees relating to work quality), general workplace health and safety laws, instruments designed to\nmanage externalities (for example, the Environmental Protection Act 1994 regulates run-off and construction site\noperating hours) and common law remedies (for example, the torts of negligence and nuisance) (NSW PC 2022; PC\n2000).\nIn many cases, occupational licensing is said to be necessary to improve safety outcomes. The Australian\nProductivity Commission considered the evidence for whether occupational licensing is the 'best way' of improving\nsafety outcomes. The inquiry found that an expansion of licensing requirements in building and construction was\n'characterised by poor assessment of health and safety risks and inadequate consideration of whether alternative\nregulation already addresses the problem — largely as a result of insufficient evidence to inform policy' (PC 2023a,\np. 68).\nThe Australian Productivity Commission cited the introduction of refrigeration and air conditioning licensing in\nQueensland as having a weak evidentiary basis. It noted that despite claims in the accompanying regulatory impact\nassessment and Parliamentary inquiry, 'supporting evidence of unsafe outcomes in Australia, let alone Queensland,\neither does not exist or is not well founded', that no evidence was produced linking unlicensed work to the spread\nof legionella was published, and that 'it remains unclear whether licensing would be more effective than other\nregulatory interventions' (PC 2023a, p. 70, citing Queensland Government 2019b; Transport and Public Works\nCommittee 2018).\nOverall, the Australian Productivity Commission concluded that:\nIn the building and construction industry, licensing has been increasingly focused on protecting\nhealth and safety despite little evidence of its effectiveness. The lack of empirical evidence\nsupporting licensing design has led to a ramping up of licensing stringency that has increased\nbarriers to entry and is likely leading to considerable inefficiencies in the provision of skills and\nreduced productivity in the sector (PC 2023a, p. 76)\nQueensland Productivity Commission 244", "text_len": 4205, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Further,\nseveral licence categories overlap, which can cause confusion for consumers looking to undertake\nbuilding work.\n• Stakeholders noted that there are approximately 40 fire protection licences in Queensland, with some\nlicences such as passive fire protection requiring unrelated trade qualifications leading to impractical\nprerequisite pathways and creating barriers to entry for experienced specialists (NFIA, sub. 46, p. 6;\nAMCA, NECA and NFIA, sub. 47, p. 5).\n• Since 2021, workers with a Certificate II in Fire Protection Inspection and Testing have been unable to\nperform “Test and Maintain” tasks due to QBCC licensing requirements. This has resulted in fire\nprotection companies assigning Certificate III holders to complete this work, reducing the pool of\ncertified personnel available. In some cases, fire protection contractors may need to dispatch three\ntechnicians whereas previously only two would have been required (Fire Protection Association\nAustralia, sub. 23, p. 2).\n• Electrical workers who successfully complete an apprenticeship require both TAFE and Electrical Safety\nOffice (ESO) approval before they can undertake further electrical work. Stakeholders reported that this\ncan take upwards of 31 days (NECA, sub. 27, p. 6).

As discussed in Part C on the regulation of building activities, any building work in Queensland with a\nvalue above $3,300 requires a commercial building licence (QBCC 2021e). However, this threshold has not recently\nindexed to inflation. As a result, stakeholders have noted that this limits the number of builders available to\ncomplete smaller household projects, which has the perverse consequence of drawing more qualified tradespeople\ninto lower-value work (Peter Cousins, comment 5). Raising the nominal threshold (with indexation over time) would\npotentially alleviate some of these pressures in the building and construction industry by aligning qualification\nrequirements more closely with the nature of work on smaller projects.\nRegardless of the underlying rationale, any purported benefits of licensing requirements must be clearly evidenced\nand must be shown to exceed any costs imposed. In the context of long-term poor construction productivity\ngrowth and deteriorating housing affordability, the need to impose additional costs through licensing\nrequirements should be rigorously tested.\nOccupational licensing in construction should be reviewed\nWhile quantifying the impacts of occupational licensing is difficult in general, Bowman et. al (2024) found that\noccupational entry requirements for electricians, painters, plumbers and architects in Queensland were more\nstringent than the OECD average, and far more stringent than the least stringent OECD countries. Therefore, the\npotential exists for large gains from reviewing and reforming occupational licensing requirements in Queensland.\nSpecific licensing requirements are often complex and technical in nature. Reforms may also have significant\nimpacts on many stakeholders, and 'getting it wrong' could lead to health and safety risks for workers and\nconsumers. Reform of occupational licensing requires rigorous a policy development process involving\ncomprehensive consultation – this all lies well beyond the timeframes or scope of this inquiry.\nInstead, it is proposed that the Queensland Government institute a coordinated multi-year program of stock\nreviews of occupation licensing requirements relevant to the construction industry. These reviews should:\n• be conducted by relevant agencies over the next several years\n• adhere to best practice regulation principles as reflected in the Queensland Government Better Regulation Policy\n(the Policy)\n• consider in each case whether:\n– there is reliable evidence of a market failure\n– market failure is better addressed through existing regulation (e.g. consumer law)\n– there is clear evidence the licensing requirement addresses the market failure effectively\n– licensing arrangements deliver net benefits to the community\n– licensing requirements deliver the greatest net benefits to the community relative to other options.\nThe Queensland Productivity Commission (the Commission) has developed a draft framework for evaluating\noccupational licensing requirements for agencies to apply to future licensing decisions (Figure 17.1). While this\nframework mirrors existing requirements under the Policy, it is intended to provide specific guidance to agencies\nundertaking those reviews. Further guidance on managing the stock of regulation is discussed in Chapter 3.\nTo inform prioritisation, the Commission is seeking stakeholder views on what specific occupational licensing\nrequirements are most likely to benefit from being reviewed.\nIt is important that the elements of this framework are applied to individual licensing requirements; even where an\noccupational licencing regime delivers net community benefits, there can be specific elements of it (for example,\nlarge amounts of mandatory compulsory professional development (CPD) or highly specialised qualification\nrequirements) that do not.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 246", "text_len": 4005, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

While an impact analysis statement was prepared, the proposal was exempted from the requirements of the\nPolicy (DJAG 2023). Issues with the analysis include:\n• It does not clearly explain the difference of its results with a previous national assessment, which found that\nremoving mandatory CPD for property occupational licensing across Australia would generate net annual\nbenefits of $37 million in 2013 dollars (Australian Government 2013).\n• Several key assumptions used to construct the cost-benefit analysis in the Queensland analysis could be\nquestioned.\n• While the changes were supported by key industry associations, they were opposed by practitioners, with an\nestimated 60–65 per cent of property agents against the changes (DJAG 2023, p. 73).\nSeveral stakeholders expressed support for mandatory CPD requirements in their respective sectors (Master\nBuilders Queensland, sub. 43, pp. 32-33; AMCA, NECA and NFIA, sub. 47, pp. 5-6; Plumbing Industry Climate Action\nGroup, sub. 56, pp. 5-6; AWCI Australia, sub. 70, pp. 1-2). CPD can update workers on current best practice and\ninnovations, while also reducing the risk of defects and inconsistent practices on construction sites by addressing\nfragmented industry knowledge bases.\nA recent NSW Productivity Commission discussion paper on CPD noted that mandating CPD creates costs, as well\nas benefits, for the community (NSW PC 2022, p. 5). In particular, mandatory CPD may be implemented without\nsufficient rationale for government intervention and may also create occupational barriers by increasing the\nresources required to remain in a profession. The NSW Productivity Commission also identified the potential for\nconflicts of interest where industry incumbents simultaneously set mandatory CPD requirements while receiving\nfee revenue for delivering CPD training.\nOverall, the introduction of further mandatory CPD requirements in the construction industry would require a\nstrong justification, especially when many industry participants already report high levels of regulatory burden and\nlabour shortages. In any case, rigorous application of regulatory impact analysis remains the best approach for\nassessing whether additional CPD requirements are likely to deliver a net benefit for the Queensland community.\nTo help ensure that current construction and housing market challenges are not further exacerbated, for any\npending changes to occupational licensing that have the potential to increase requirements for the construction\nindustry and have not been subject to appropriate analysis, their commencement should be suspended until that\nanalysis is complete.\nThere are opportunities to reduce barriers to labour mobility\nEnsuring that any licensing requirements are necessary, effective, and efficient should be a priority of government.\nWhere licensing is justified, however, it should also not unnecessarily restrict practitioners moving between or\noperating in multiple jurisdictions.\nLicensing requirements can contribute to reduced labour mobility across state borders. Workers in cross-border\nareas and larger businesses operating in multiple jurisdictions may be particularly affected by these barriers. In\nparticular, NECA (sub. 41, p. 3) noted that electrical contractors operating in border areas such as\nCoolangatta/Tweed Heads and Goondiwindi must comply with different licensing, insurance, and competency\nrequirements enforced by separate regulators.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 248", "text_len": 4214, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

As above, there is a clear\nin-principle basis for Queensland participation in such a scheme. However, it should only do so if the licensing\nrequirements are necessary, effective, and impose the minimum costs necessary to achieve the policy objective.\nThe Commission notes that the Australian Productivity Commission has been directed to provide ‘analysis and\nmodelling’ of, among other things, ‘an occupational licensing scheme that provides for labour mobility nationally’\nwith an interim report scheduled for release in July 2025 (PC 2025b). If relevant, the results of that analysis will be\nused to inform this inquiry.\nQueensland could extend recognition of interstate licences\nMutual recognition is a process in which one jurisdiction recognises equivalent licences issued in another and\napproves the licensee to undertake similar work (typically on application by the licensee). Automatic mutual\nrecognition (AMR) is a process by which a worker licensed in one state or territory is automatically considered\nregistered to complete the same work in another.\nQueensland is the only state that does not participate in AMR (DEWR 2024b). In contrast, NSW recognises a variety\nof interstate building licences including bricklayers, carpenters, plasterers, fencers, glaziers, joiners, painters, tilers,\nand stonemasons (NSW Government 2024a), allowing tradespeople licensed in other states to work there without\nadditional fees and minimal requirements.\nStakeholders were generally supportive of Queensland adopting AMR (Engineers Australia, sub. 36; QMCA, sub. 66,\np. 37; REIQ, sub. 67, p. 9), but cautioned that AMR must involve mechanisms to verify the substantial equivalence of\ncompetencies to avoid the risk of jurisdictions with less rigorous requirements leading to lower safety and quality\nstandards (NFIA, sub. 46, p. 9; AMCA, NECA and NFIA, sub. 47, p. 6). The National Fire Industry Association (NFIA,\nsub. 46, p. 9) suggested that Queensland may need to advocate for national minimum benchmarks or\nsupplementary competency assessments for specific high-risk licence classes.\nBy enhancing labour mobility, AMR can benefit workers, businesses, and consumers as it allows workers to move to\nregions where demand is greatest, helps businesses to manage supply shortages, allows better matching of\nworkers to jobs, improves the supply of construction services and encourages the dissemination of new\ntechnologies or processes.\nWhile permanent interstate migrants are likely to obtain new licensing when they move, AMR is most likely to\nbenefit regional areas along the NSW border where workers might temporarily relocate in response to high\ndemand. For example, the NSW Cross-Border Commissioner argued that a lack of AMR in Queensland negatively\naffected the ability of those communities to rebuild after severe flooding in 2022 (Rennie 2022). It is not\nunreasonable to expect similar challenges could arise if severe flooding were to occur in southern Queensland.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 249", "text_len": 4229, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

However, the Commission has been unable to source specific evidence showing\nQueensland’s regulation results in better outcomes than that in other jurisdictions, and it is not obvious why\noccupational regulation considered appropriate in the rest of the country would be inappropriate in a single state.\nConversely, it may be the case that the additional administrative costs associated with participating in AMR\noutweigh any potential gains. While the Commission does not presently have the information required to assess\nthese prospective costs, the take-up of AMR in all other Australian jurisdictions suggests that this is unlikely to be a\nmaterial barrier (assuming Queensland’s regulatory performance is not significantly less efficient).\nOn balance, publicly available information suggests that the benefits of Queensland’s participation in AMR would\noutweigh the costs or risks. To support further analysis, the Commission is seeking evidence in relation to the\nconstruction industry of specific regulatory outcomes achieved under Queensland’s regimes that would not be\nachieved under those in other states or territories.

For\nthis to occur, it would be essential that any work performed by migrant workers meets the quality and safety\nstandards required of Australian workers.\nA relatively small proportion of construction workers are migrants (compared to other industries), and a relatively\nsmall proportion of migrants work in construction (Coates & Wiltshire 2024). Both the Australian Productivity\nCommission (2025a) and Grattan Institute (Coates & Wiltshire 2024) have called for greater use of skilled overseas\nmigration to address workforce shortages.\nWhile migration is primarily a matter for the Australian Government, there are two channels through which the\nQueensland Government can help leverage skills of international workers.\nFirst, the Queensland Government can nominate workers under two visa classes:\n• the skilled nominated (Permanent) visa (subclass 190), which provides permanent residence for skilled workers;\nor\n• the skilled work regional (Permanent) visa (subclass 491), which is a five-year visa that leads to permanent\nresidency after working in regional Queensland for at least three years. This visa superseded the skilled regional\n(provisional) visa (subclass 489) in 2019.\nBoth nominated and regional visas have similar requirements, including that:\n• the applicant has an eligible skilled occupation (Migration (LIN 19/051: Specification of Occupations and Relevant\nAssessing Authorities) Instrument 2019 (Cth)). These occupations include many construction skills in shortage, for\nexample, civil engineers, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, and architectural draftspersons.48\n• the applicant has been living and working in Queensland for at least six months (for subclass 190) or in regional\nQueensland for at least three months (for subclass 491)\n• the applicant has evidence of ongoing, non-casual employment\n• the applicant commits to living and working in Queensland for two years (for subclass 190) or regional\nQueensland for three years (for subclass 491) (Migration Queensland n.d.).\nThis pipeline appears relatively underused — Queensland has an allocation of only 1,200 state nominated migrants\nin 2024–25 (Migration Queensland n.d.), compared to the 26,260 total state and local government allocation\n(Department of Home Affairs 2025). This is well below Queensland’s population share of the total allocation.\nTypically only around 100 or fewer construction trades workers permanently migrate to Queensland under those\nprograms each year49 (QPC; Department of Home Affairs 2024).\nSecond, the Queensland Government can reduce duplicative or unnecessary barriers to skilled overseas migration\nand the ability of migrants to apply those skills. The Australian Productivity Commission recently noted that skills\nassessments for migration purposes and licensing purposes may not be fully aligned. They note that an electrician,\nbefore being able to work without supervision, would need to both:\n• have their qualifications and skills recognised through the Offshore Skills Assessment Program or a Temporary\nSkill Shortage Skills Assessment\n• undertake 12 months of supervised work under a licensed electrician to apply for an appropriate Certificate III\n(PC 2023a, p. 55).\n48 The skills list was last updated in December 2024.\n49 Over the previous 10 years excluding 2019–20 to 2020–21 during which border closures were in effect.

Stockland (sub. 29, p. 3) submitted that only 2.8 per cent of migrants entering the country over\nthe past five years had skills relevant to the construction industry, arguing that this proportion should be closer to\n10 per cent, approximately the proportion of the total workforce in construction.\nSeveral stakeholders raised concerns about visa cost and processing times, recommending the inclusion of all\ntrades-related occupations in the Core Skills pathway of the Skills in Demand visa (Master Builders Queensland,\nsub. 43, pp. 27-28; Queensland Major Contractors Association, sub. 66, p. 37).

New Zealand removed labour market testing for certain occupations and streamlined skilled overseas\nmigration policies, increasing the share of temporary and permanent migrants in the construction work force from\n6.8 per cent in 2012 to 13.7 per cent in 2019 (Schiff 2022, p. 9).\nMaster Builders Queensland (sub. 43, p. 28) also proposed nationally accredited gap training in licensed trades\nsuch as carpentry and bricklaying for migrant tradespeople from jurisdictions with comparable qualification and\ntraining frameworks. The Queensland Productivity Commission (the Commission) notes that BuildSkills Australia is\ncurrently undertaking a project to develop a Minimum Australian Context Gap course for skilled migrant plumbers\n(BuildSkills Australia 2025).\nIt is also important to note that there are already mutual recognition processes for New Zealand migrants in\nQueensland (and other states) under the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition (Queensland) Act 2003. For example,\nholders of New Zealand electrical work licences can apply for an equivalent Queensland licence under that Act\n(WorkSafe 2020). As recommended by the Australian Productivity Commission (2023a, p. 54), there may be scope\nto increase mutual recognition with 'similar countries', though this would likely require stronger links between\ndomestic and international licensing bodies.\nIn general, there is little available information on specific state-level opportunities to use skilled overseas migration\nto assist in addressing construction workforce challenges. The Commission is therefore seeking stakeholder views\non whether those opportunities exist, what they could be (for example, if there is scope to nominate more\nconstruction workers under state-nominated visa programs), and what the benefits, costs and risks associated with\nthose options could be.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 254", "text_len": 3113, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The primary aims of the scheme are to ‘protect workers from\nexploitation’ by labour hire service providers, and to ‘promote the integrity of the labour hire industry’ (Labour Hire\nLicensing Act 2017 (Qld) s 3).\nLabour hire arrangements can have a number of benefits to:\n• construction firms, by allowing them to flexibly manage their workforce in response to variable or unplanned\ndemand\n• construction workers, by allowing them to obtain work more easily, gain skills or experience, undertake flexible\nor varied work, or 'try out' new occupations\n• the broader economy, by facilitating matching of workers and firms which improves capacity utilisation (for both\nlabour and capital) and productivity (Ai Group 2016; Master Builders Queensland 2017b; PC 2015; Shomos et al.\n2013).\nAs noted by Master Builders Queensland:\nThe benefits of labour hire arrangements in the building and construction industry are obvious.\nOverall, it allows the contractors to conveniently access a supply of labour to meet peaks and\ntroughs in demand. All parties to the labour hire relationship have legitimate economic reasons\nfor electing to use that mode of service provision, namely flexibility and accessibility to the market.\n(Master Builders Queensland 2017b, p. 2)\nConversely, labour hire can create risks for workers, particularly those vulnerable to exploitation (such as temporary\nmigrants). In 2016, an inquiry into the practices of the labour hire industry by the Queensland Parliament Finance\nand Administration Committee heard evidence of ‘undercutting’ of employment conditions by labour hire\ncompanies, in the form of underpayment of award wages; unsafe working conditions; the non-payment of tax,\nsuperannuation and workers’ compensation premiums; and ‘sham contracting’ (disguising employment\narrangements as independent contracting) (Parliament of Queensland 2016, pp. 19–26). Submissions to the inquiry\nalso argued that labour hire workers experienced poorer workplace health and safety outcomes than permanent\nemployees, (for example CFMEU 2016; Underhill 2016). Dr Underhill, a researcher who has undertaken research into\nlabour hire working arrangements, argued that these risks were well established:\nAll studies of labour hire workers and occupational health and safety in Australia and overseas\nhave found that labour hire employees are more likely to be injured at work, compared to direct\nhire workers in like occupations …\nAll studies of injured labour hire and other forms of temporary employment, in Australia and\noverseas, have found that those injured at work are less likely to be offered employment postinjury\nthan permanent employees (Underhill 2016, p. 3)\nA general assessment of labour hire regulation is beyond the scope of this inquiry. In general, however, the\nrationale for regulating labour hire in a construction context appears weaker than for other industries:\n• In Queensland, the labour hire regulator's most recent annual report does not include construction as an\nindustry with ‘high risk' of non-compliance with legal obligations (OIR 2023).\n• In 2017, the Decision RIS supporting the introduction Labour Hire Licensing Act claimed that, ‘in the construction\nindustry, the use of labour hire workers or contractors can be linked with decreased pay rates under payment of\nwages, as well as higher incidence of workplace health and safety issues or accidents’ (OIR 2017, p. 10).\nHowever, it does not provide specific evidence to support this claim. Further, Australian Government changes\nmade in 2024 allow employees, unions and host employers to apply for a regulated labour hire arrangement\norder that requires employees working for a particular host to be paid no less than the same pay rate they\nwould receive under the host’s enterprise agreement (Fair Work Ombudsman 2024).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 257", "text_len": 4058, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 260, "text": "Labour hire licensing\n• In 2019, the Migrant Workers Taskforce reporting to the Australian Government found that a national labour\nhire registration regime should be a 'light touch regulatory model' which would 'act as a form of negative\nlicensing'. The proposed model would not apply to construction labour hire, instead targeting the four activities\nit determined to be 'high risk'50 (Australian Government 2019, pp. 105–106). In 2020, citing this report (among\nothers), the South Australian Government reduced the scope of its comparable legislation to a list of prescribed\n'high risk' occupations, which did not include construction work (Labour Hire Licensing Act 2017 (SA); Labour\nHire Licensing (Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill - Second Reading 2020).\n• The established UK regime — which is often cited as a successful historic implementation of labour hire\nregulations (see, for example Forsyth 2019; OIR 2017) — does not apply to construction workers (Gangmasters\n(Licensing) Act 2004 (UK) s 3).51\nSome stakeholders have also argued that the scheme duplicates requirements in other legislation (for example, the\nFair Work Act 2009 (Cth)). In the context of construction:\n• The Housing Industry Association (2017) argued that the discovery of 'poor practices' in the labour hire industry\nwas evidence of the effectiveness of the other regulatory frameworks (such as by the Fair Work Ombudsman or\nthe Department of Immigration) without the need for specific labour hire licensing.\n• Master Builders Queensland stated that as workers and businesses (including labour hire firms) are already\nlicensed by the QBCC to contract to the industry, an additional labour hire licence ‘is superfluous and will add\ncosts and administration to these employers, whilst not providing any benefit to the industry' (Master Builders\nQueensland 2017b, p. 2).\n• Consult Australia (sub. 28, p. 15) submitted that labour hire laws in Queensland create an unnecessary burden\non businesses where labour hire is only incidental to their services, such as consulting businesses, with reporting\nrequirements resulting in a regulatory impost of over $200,000 per business.\nThe available evidence is not sufficient to conclude whether labour hire licensing delivers net community benefits\nwhen applied to construction. Even if it does, however, those benefits may be better obtained through a national\n(rather than state-based) scheme. Forsyth (2019) notes the 'most problematic feature' of the state-based licensing\nschemes are differences in how 'labour hire' is defined across jurisdictions, and this has the potential to increase\ncosts, uncertainty and complexity for both operators and their clients. The Migrant Workers Taskforce similarly\nfound that state-based schemes increase regulatory costs on operators, and that 'a single national regulatory\nscheme is preferable over different and overlapping state-based schemes' (Australian Government 2019, p. 105).\nThere appears to be ongoing work related to nationally harmonised labour hire regulation — in 2023, the\nAustralian Department of Employment and Workplace Relations published a consultation regulatory impact\nstatement on a National Labour Hire Regulation scheme (DEWR 2023a), and in April 2024 the Commonwealth\nGovernment funded the Victorian Government 'as in-principle host jurisdiction, to lead national labour hire\nimplementation development as well as the establishment of a project office which is managing a range of scoping\nand planning work for a National Labour Hire Regulator' (Federal Financial Relations 2024). As of the publication of\nthis interim report, however, the Queensland Productivity Commission (the Commission) has not been able to\nascertain the status of this work. In addition, the Queensland Government has also announced that it will not adopt\nVictorian legislation as part of any national law labour hire scheme (Hannan & McKenna 2025).\nMore generally, any participation in a national scheme must demonstrate net benefits to the Queensland public. If\nthe national scheme is significantly more onerous than local legislation, for example, the benefits of harmonisation\nmay be outweighed by the additional regulatory impost.\n50 The four high risk sectors were horticulture, meat processing, cleaning, and security. This regulation would apply to\nconstruction firms when engaging in security or cleaning labour hire.\n51 Although there has been some consideration of whether it should be extended to construction (see Joint Committee on\nHuman Rights 2017).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 258", "text_len": 4562, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

These followed measures introduced\nin Victoria in 2015 in response to community concerns about increasing foreign property purchases, particularly in\n“off-plan” dwellings (Douglas 2024, p. 9).\nThese State charges are in addition to several other restrictions or obligations imposed on foreign individuals and\nother entities by the Australian Government (Box 20.1).\nBox 20.1 Other restrictions on foreign investment\nAustralian Government restrictions and obligations:\n• requirement to pay an annual vacancy fee if dwellings are unoccupied for 183 days or more in a year,\nreducing incentives for foreign owners to hold dwellings idle for capital gains rather than renting to\ntenants.\n• requirement for Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval for property purchases.

Wokker & Swieringa\n(2016) found foreign investment was responsible for a small proportion of residential property price growth. The\nstudy found that over a five-year period, foreign investment contributed between $80 and $122 to quarterly\ndwelling price growth in Sydney and Melbourne, compared with total quarterly property price growth of $12,800 (a\ncontribution of less than 1 per cent). Similarly Guest and Rohde (2017) found the impacts on dwelling prices in\nBrisbane were negligible. Both studies concluded that other demand factors and supply constraints are materially\nimpacting housing affordability.\nThe data shows the share of foreign owners is low, suggesting their impact on affordability likely remains\ninsignificant.53 Data from NAB (2024), for the December quarter 2023, estimates that foreign buyers made up\n11.0 per cent of new residential property market sales and 4.0 per cent of established residential property sales in\nAustralia. In Queensland, in the same period, foreign buyers made up 6.3 per cent of new residential development\npurchases and 4.1 per cent of established residential property market activity.\nForeign investment’s role in investment and development\nForeign investment likely increases the capital stock, reduces financing costs and improves project viability.\nStakeholders have said that foreign investment helps progress construction projects and is often a key difference\nbetween a project being viable or not. An RBA paper concluded that it is likely foreign investment in new housing\nincreases supply:\n… construction by foreign developers have probably resulted in a somewhat higher stock of housing\nin Australia than would otherwise have been the case, although by a magnitude that is difficult to\ndetermine (Gauder et al. 2014, p. 18).\nForeign investment is also likely to be crucial to the development of new and emerging types of housing, such as\nbuild to rent (BTR), which is attracting significant levels of overseas interest (Gilbert & Tobin 2023). The Australian\nGovernment’s updated foreign investment policy document acknowledges the importance of foreign investors to\nthe BTR market by:\n• allowing for the purchase of established BTR properties\n• providing for FIRB approval processes to be streamlined for passive institutional investors with a history of\nstrong compliance (Australian Treasury 2025; Wilkie et al. 2024).\nMore broadly, foreign direct investment often has spillover impacts.54 Direct investors are often sophisticated,\nhighly productive businesses, near the frontier of technology, knowledge and innovation (PC 2020a). Research has\nshown that knowledge spillovers, which drive productivity gains through the application of new methods and\ntechnologies, arise from international direct investment, through the diffusion of ideas, technology and managerial\nexpertise.\n53 In 2021–22, foreign investors made 4,228 residential real estate purchases in Australia, almost $4 billion. Foreign investors also\nsold 2,349 properties with a value of $2.1 billion. This compares with a total of almost 600,000 property transactions in Australia\nwith a value upwards of $365 billion in the same year. Foreign purchases accounted for only around 1 per cent of national\nproperty purchases (Australian Treasury 2023; ABS 2023c).\n54 There are also potential spillover costs, such as national security risks, environmental degradation and aggressive tax\nminimisation strategies.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 265", "text_len": 3588, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The Housing Industry Association (sub. 32, pp. 13-14) noted:\nAdditional taxes imposed on foreign investors at both state and federal government levels are\nlimiting investing in new housing. Since Queensland introduced the additional foreign acquirer\nduty in 2016, multi-unit commencements are tracking at half of previous levels. This tax also\nimpacts the detached housing market as one in ten detached houses built in Australia are built by\nan overseas owned builder. These global home builders bring to Australia an investment in leading\nedge building technologies and products.\nA consultancy commissioned by the Property Council of Australia (PCA) (2024) estimated that since 2016,\nQueensland's additional foreign taxes resulted in 33,000 fewer homes being built. Additionally, stakeholders have\nclaimed that such changes have actually had an adverse impact on state revenue (around $99.5 million), due to a\nreduction in foreign owned property transactions (Francis 2024; PCA 2024b).\nSimilar impacts have also been observed in the rest of the country. In Victoria, the introduction of and subsequent\nincrease in their additional duty and surcharge coincided with a 72.8 per cent reduction in foreign investor\nsupplied dwellings between 2014–15 and 2016–17. This decline in foreign investment also led to reduced state\nrevenues from property taxes (PCA 2025a, p. 1 & 5).\nThe impact on Queensland appears to be compounded by a broad definition of ‘foreign resident’, which can lead\nto firms being unintentionally caught up in the FLTS and AFAD due to their structure or where they obtain capital.55\nWhile it is possible these firms, or firms whose activities contribute substantially to the housing stock (or to the\nQueensland economy and community), can obtain ‘ex gratia’ relief, this process is difficult, can take up to 18\nmonths and, as it is determined on a case by case basis, does not guarantee success. This process is also likely to\nincur residual costs due to uncertainty and holding costs (PCA 2024b, p. 12). In response to these concerns, the\nQueensland Government has announced, as part of the 2025–26 State Budget, that it will streamline the ex gratia\nprocess to give investors ‘faster access and greater certainty on eligibility rulings’ (Hall 2025).\nContinued use of taxes on foreign investment\nSome stakeholders have called for the repeal of state taxes targeting foreign investment. For example, the Real\nEstate Institute of Queensland (REIQ) (sub. 67, p. 11) said:\nThe REIQ continues to oppose the application and recent increases of foreign investor surcharges\non transfer duty and land tax. … We recommend that these surcharges be rescinded to support\ncapital flow, housing development, and market competitiveness.\nLand taxes are generally considered an efficient tax, while stamp duties are considered an inefficient tax. The case\nfor prioritising the removal of the foreign taxes on purchases is stronger than the case for removing the additional\nland tax. However, if land taxes price foreign development and construction companies out of holding land for\ndevelopment purposes, they may also be distortionary.\nThis distortion may decrease competition, potentially driving higher construction costs that pass through to house\nprices.

These connections typically involve a formal approval process, in addition to a\ndevelopment approval.\nFor many stakeholders, securing utility connections has become a key ‘pain point’ that is hampering the timely\ndelivery of residential and commercial construction projects and resulting in significant and unplanned additional\ncosts. The two main issues identified were claims that requirements are being applied inconsistently by utility\nproviders (potentially due to differing interpretations) as well as poor coordination and delays.\nInconsistent requirements can lead to less productive outcomes\nStakeholders suggested that different standards were being applied, by Energy Queensland and other industry\nparticipants, which deviate from national standards. This is leading to increased costs and delays. Master Builders\nQueensland (sub. 43, p. 23) stated:\nThe Connections Manual and Australian Wiring Rules are being applied inconsistently. Different\nstandards are being applied between Energy Queensland the electrical consultants as well as\ndifferent standards between Energex and Ergon. This can lead to very costly and unplanned for\nexpenses.\nSimilarly, in relation to the connection of terrace houses, Master Electricians Australia (sub. 37, p. 6) noted:\nEQL’s interpretation of The Wiring Rules has not been adopted by any regulator or any other\nDistribution Network Service Provider (DNSP) in Australia as far as we are aware. EQL’s\nrequirement leads to delays in connections, changes in design and hesitation to undertake\nelectrical repair work for fear a reconnection will not be approved by EQL.\nSome stakeholders also noted there were multiple variations on designs (sometimes midway through a project)\nand claimed that differing interpretations had led to additional, and in their view unnecessary, infrastructure\nrequirements being imposed. The Housing Industry Association noted (sub. 32, p. 21):\nEnergy Queensland has significantly expanded the locations that a chamber pad-mounted\ntransformer is required to installed to include most inner-city areas of Brisbane and the Gold Coast.\nThis appears to be a blatant cost shifting exercise aimed at pushing the cost of trunk infrastructure\nonto new apartment buyers.\nStakeholders are therefore seeking more efficient avenues to review and contest decisions by Energy Queensland\nin their interpretation of relevant rules and standards (Master Builders Queensland, sub. 43; Master Electricians\nAustralia, sub. 37).\nInconsistent application of regulatory standards and requirements can undermine the effectiveness of, and\nconfidence in, the agreed regulatory framework and create delays, unexpected costs, and unnecessary burdens.\nAny requirements or conditions applied by utility providers should align, as far as practicable, with existing agreed\nstandards. Where they do not align, the utility provider should offer clear, transparent, and evidence-based\njustifications for any differing requirements imposed.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 270", "text_len": 3205, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 273, "text": "Utility connections\nGreater coordination may be required, particularly for greenfield\ndevelopments\nStakeholders raised the issue of prolonged delays on project connections, which they argued exceeded statutory\ntimeframes for delivery (Master Electricians Australia, sub. 37). Stakeholders also provided examples from their\nmembers of inefficient processes and poor customer service, such as lengthy and duplicative requests for\ninformation and difficulty obtaining clear advice on compliance (Master Builders Queensland, sub. 43). Some\nstakeholders argued for the establishment of key performance indicators for statutory bodies aimed at setting\nexpectations for timely responses and the efficient connection of utilities (Master Builders Queensland, sub. 43).\nIt was observed by some stakeholders that many delays are due to poor coordination between utility providers,\ndevelopers, and local governments. Stakeholders noted that in many instances local governments worked in silos,\nwith limited communication and collaboration with others. It was also noted developers and utility providers may\noperate on different schedules from each other, with developers wanting to fast-track construction, while utility\nproviders may have longer lead times for planning and installing infrastructure.\nHowever, stakeholders also provided examples in consultation of more serious coordination issues, where\ndevelopments that had been planned for over a decade were still waiting for key utilities to be connected in time\nfor handover. This misalignment can delay the delivery of essential services, leaving completed developments\nwithout utilities or forcing a pause in construction.\nThese issues are likely to be more heavily felt in greenfield developments, which face different challenges in\nproviding infrastructure, including utility connections, compared to infill projects. For example, data by the Urban\nDevelopment Institute of Australia (2025) suggests 58 per cent of new homes on residential land in South East\nQueensland (compared to 33 per cent on average across Australian’s major cities) have been stalled due to\ninadequate infrastructure.\nAs noted in the land use section of this report, evidence suggests that building new infrastructure in greenfield\nareas is much more costly than adapting infrastructure in established areas, as these areas often require entirely\nnew infrastructure. These issues may be exacerbated by lack of funding or cost recovery mechanisms for\ninfrastructure provision (see Part B for further discussion on this issue). On the other hand, increased demands\nfrom infill can also be strategically leveraged by the renewal of ageing assets, where new infrastructure investments\nare aligned with the replacement or upgrading of existing assets nearing the end of their useful life.\nWhile the Queensland Government has sought to address some of these infrastructure issues through its\nResidential Activation Fund, appropriate coordination and collaboration between local governments and utility\nproviders can ensure new dwellings are serviced by the timely and efficient provision of utility services. This\nsupports parallel development of utilities infrastructure and dwelling projects, improving both infrastructure\nefficiency and dwelling construction times.\nAn existing tool that appears designed to support this coordination is the use of Water Netserv Plans by water\nservice providers operating in South East Queensland. These plans guide the planning and delivery of future water\nand sewerage infrastructure and can assist in aligning regional and local development priorities with planned utility\nprovision.\nThe Commission is seeking further information from stakeholders on the extent to which such coordination already\noccurs, and where there may be further opportunities to align development approval with timely infrastructure\nprovision and utility connection.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 271", "text_len": 3937, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The EQ EBA applies until 2028.\nA key change in the new EQ EBA is the requirement under schedule 9, section 1.8 (b) to apply EQ EBA rates of pay\nand conditions to the employees of contractors and subcontractors carrying out contestable works56 on the EQ\nnetwork, as well as work on assets that will become part of the network (Energy Queensland 2024a). As a result,\nwork on subdivisions, large customer connections and public lighting projects are to be performed in accordance\nwith the EQ EBA rates of pay and conditions.\nNumerous stakeholders have raised concerns about this change in the context of:\n• increased costs and timeframes of infrastructure delivery\n• scheduling difficulties when performing work on EQ assets and other customers\n• being captured under EBA terms and conditions that they were not party to, and frustration that despite actively\ndeciding not to tender for BPIC related works, they have indirectly been captured by similar terms and\nconditions\n• the disproportionate impact these changes will have in regional areas, due to the limited number of skilled\nworkers.\nThese concerns are discussed in more detail below.\nNumerous stakeholders have told us that the higher rates of pay and conditions will increase project costs and\nconstruction timeframes. The Housing Industry Association (HIA) (sub. 32, p. 16) estimates that new housing\nallotments will be around $10,000 more expensive. Master Builders Queensland (sub. 43, p. 24) also estimates that\nthe changes will elicit significant cost increases:\n... for these works all accredited contractors must pay all their workers for all work undertaken in-\nline with Energy Queensland’s current EBA. Effectively turning the electrical works on any\ncontestable project into a union site. This will see a 20-30 per cent increase in costs on all\ncontestable projects and on the contestable portion of connection applications and relocation\nprojects (generally limited to the trenching/conduit/civil works portion of these projects).\nAccording to the HIA (sub. 32, p. 16), the higher rates of pay and allowances will even apply to employees\ndelivering non-electrical works, such as retaining walls and excavation trenches.\nMaster Builders Queensland (sub. 43, p. 24) flagged that these higher rates of pay and conditions may deter some\nbuilders from delivering contestable works, which may exacerbate project cost increases and delays due to\ndampened competition in the market.\nStakeholders also told us that contractors and subcontractors have had to change their processes (for example,\nMaster Electricians Australia, sub. 37, p. 15). This has been a particular issue for firms delivering projects that are\nnow covered under the EQ EBA alongside projects that are not covered.\n56 Contestable works refer to works that can be done by a third-party provider, compared to non-contestable works that can\nonly be completed by Energy Queensland. Contestable works are “contestable” in the sense that multiple providers can bid to\ncomplete these works.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 274", "text_len": 3425, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 277, "text": "Energy Queensland’s Enterprise Bargaining\nAgreement\nAccording to stakeholders, these changes have effectively led to employees working on contestable works being\npaid more for nearly-identical work compared to their colleagues on other projects, leading to intracompany\ntension. To resolve this, firms are either being forced to provide all their employees conditions that match the EQ\nEBA, which leads to higher costs on projects the EQ EBA does not apply to, or to coordinate their employees to\nspend similar time on contestable works.\nStakeholders also reported the higher rates of pay and conditions on contestable works may be incentivising\napprentices to seek apprenticeships on these types of projects. This distortion of the apprenticeship market may\nfurther exacerbate construction skills shortages in other areas.\nAs noted in Chapter 6, there appears to be limited, if any, scope for change in the short term for contestable works\nto be done on terms other than the EQ EBA. The Commission would like to hear from stakeholders on whether the\ninterim stakeholder views are an accurate interpretation of the EQ EBA’s impact on productivity across the\nconstruction industry and what measures could be taken over the short- to medium-term to ameliorate the impact\non housing prices and construction industry productivity more generally.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 275", "text_len": 1380, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The Queensland\nconstruction sector contributed $37.6 billion to total economic output and employed 279,000 people in 2023–24.\nThe construction sector is broad — it includes residential and commercial building, civil engineering and\nconstruction services. The productivity of the sector has a large impact on the state’s housing market and housing\naffordability, the competitiveness of industries using construction inputs and the delivery and cost of important\npublic infrastructure including transport, energy, education and health facilities.\nConstruction productivity growth over the last three decades has been weak compared to the broader economy in\nboth Queensland and across Australia. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry has been under substantial\npressure, with surging construction input prices, rising insolvencies, and constraints on the supply of labour and\nmaterials. At the same time, the ongoing housing shortage and large Queensland Government capital program\n(including the delivery of Brisbane 2032 Olympics infrastructure) mean lifting construction productivity to deliver\nincreased market capacity is more important than ever.\nTo ensure the construction sector can meet Queensland’s infrastructure and housing needs, the inquiry will\nexamine policy and regulatory factors that are affecting the productivity of the construction sector in Queensland.\nThe Crisafulli government has a stated aim of delivering one million new dwellings across Queensland by 2044\n(approx. 50,000 per year). Recent annual completions have been below 35,000 dwellings per annum which is in\nline with completion levels in 1980s when population was half of today’s levels. To meet this target the sector will\nneed to improve its level of productivity.\nFurther, vacancy rates across the state for rental properties sit around 1 per cent across the major centres. It is\nimperative that Queensland has the correct regulatory environment and policy settings in place to support\nproductivity and address housing supply and affordability issues and support delivery of public infrastructure\nprojects.\nThe Inquiry\nThe Queensland Productivity Commission (QPC) is directed to undertake an inquiry reviewing the factors driving\nproductivity in the Queensland construction sector and make recommendations for reform to improve productivity\nwithout compromising quality and safety outcomes.\nWithout directing the QPC as to the contents of its advice or recommendations in the report, I direct the QPC to\ninvestigate and report on:\n• current conditions in the housing market, residential development sector, infrastructure delivery and\nconstruction sector in Queensland, including in both housing and non-residential construction as they relate to\nthe delivery of additional housing supply and housing affordability\nQueensland Productivity Commission 278", "text_len": 3355, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The temporary\nsuspension applies to:\n• all new major government-funded projects\n• projects that have not reached the procurement stage\n• projects in procurement, where future stages have not been finalised, or where there is no approved EBA (or\nindustrial instrument) — on a project-by-project basis.\nThe temporary suspension is to remain in place until the Commission has completed an assessment of the\neconomic impacts of BPICs and the government has responded (Queensland Government 2024f). However, BPICs\nstill apply on many sites where work was already underway at the time the policy was paused.\nThe purpose of this appendix is to:\n• provide a technical outline of the Commission’s modelling used to assess the economic impacts of BPICs on\ngovernment construction projects\n• describe the main mechanisms through which the application of BPICs is likely to impose costs and benefits on\nthe community\n• present key results from the modelling.\nApproach\nThis assessment uses a standard cost-benefit analysis (CBA) to estimate the potential impacts of BPICs and reflects\nthe best evidence available to the Commission at the time of writing.\nCBA is the most appropriate approach for analysing the impacts of reforms since it:\n• allows consideration of impacts on all stakeholders\n• provides a well-accepted framework for showing how costs and benefits accrue to stakeholders\n• makes key assumptions transparent\n• allows for consideration of public benefit.\nThe CBA looks at four broad impacts:\n• the benefits of the policy to construction workers — these include benefits from enhanced wages and\nconditions, and improved safety outcomes\n• the costs and benefits for the community — these include the costs of paying for higher construction costs, as\nwell as costs (and benefits) from any changes in productivity and changes to project timeframes\n• impacts on residential construction, and how this is likely to impact renters and first homebuyers\n• impacts on other construction, and how this is likely to affect business investment.\nThe analysis has been conducted to provide an indication of the potential impacts of BPICs over the period 2024-\n25 to 2029-30 (assuming no pause had occurred). While the analysis has been informed by observed market\nperformance and stakeholder evidence, it is not intended to provide a precise estimate of actual outcomes, but\nrather to illustrate how BPICs may impact the community if it applies in the future.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 284", "text_len": 2688, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

There are significant\nuncertainties associated with estimating this counterfactual (see below), as the market has already been\ninfluenced by BPICs. For example, current EBAs for Tier 1 construction firms reflect the same conditions as BPICs.\nHowever, current awards and regulations specify standard industry conditions, such as weather-related\noperating conditions, which are assumed to operate in the counterfactual (world without BPICs). The impacts\nfrom BPICs then, are the difference between the industry standards and the conditions in BPICs. That is, the\nanalysis only considers the additional conditions imposed by BPICs.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 285", "text_len": 873, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The modelling assumes any increase in the cost of the government’s capital\nprogram is paid for through higher taxes, but the assumptions would be broadly similar if the modelling had\nassumed these costs were paid for through borrowings or passed on to consumers as higher energy prices.\n• In line with research by Nassios et al. (2019), it is assumed that the excess burden of taxation58 is 30 cents per\ndollar, that is, for every $1 of tax raised, taxes are assumed to impose a cost of $1.30 on the broader community.\nThis assumption is consistent with other research on the excess burden of taxation, some of which estimate\nsignificantly higher excess burdens (for example see Murphy 2016; Tran & Wende 2017).\n• In line with Australian Government guidelines (Office of Impact Analysis 2024), leisure time is valued at its\nopportunity cost — the trade-off between work and leisure time is approximated by the average hourly wage,\nincluding overtime, after tax. The modelling adopts the after tax, average hourly wage for construction workers\n($39.06 in 2024-25 dollars) as the value of any increased leisure time resulting from BPICs.\n• Consistent with Queensland Government guidance (Queensland Government 2021) all cost and benefits are\npresented as net present values (NPV), discounted at 7 per cent, real (fiscal year 2024-25).\nFurther details on specific mechanisms and assumptions are provided below.\nDealing with uncertainty\nThere is some uncertainty concerning the impacts of BPICs on government sites because:\n• the way many of the BPICs terms or conditions are implemented on the ground are uncertain and may vary\nfrom site to site\n• there is ambiguity in the extent to which the conditions outlined in BPICs vary from award or industry standard\nconditions in practice\n• there is uncertainty around how some negotiable terms are applied to sites where they are not mandatory — for\nexample, BPICs state that conditions related to inclement weather should be negotiated in regions outside of\nSouth East Queensland (SEQ).\nMore broadly, the extent to which BPICs creates pressure on other building sites to adopt ‘BPICs-like’ conditions is\nunclear. Due to tightness in the labour market, sites competing for labour akin to those BPICs projects face\npressure to lift wages and offer more worker-favourable conditions.\nLastly, there have been substantial increases in construction costs that are unrelated to BPICs. These have arisen\nfrom strong national demand for construction services and a series of international supply shocks. These factors\nmake it difficult in some cases to completely disentangle the effects of BPICs from other underlying conditions in\nthe construction industry.\nBecause of these difficulties, the modelling adopts a ‘cautious’ approach to attributing changes to BPICs. That is,\nthe modelling tries to be conservative when it comes to assessing the likely impacts on wages and conditions.\nTo allow for uncertainty the modelling uses ‘high’ and ‘low’ scenarios to test a range of estimates.\nTable C.1 provides an overview of the high and low scenarios, and the key assumptions used, with further details\nprovided in later sections.\n57The modelling could have assumed any extra costs would be paid for by reducing other expenditures, but this was considered\nunlikely. In any event, any reduced expenditures, such as fewer schools, police or hospitals, would likely impose even higher\ncosts on the community than has been assumed in the modelling.\n58Excess burdens from taxation arise for two reasons. Firstly, there is an administrative cost of raising taxes, both because\ngovernment needs to administer its tax collection, and because individuals and firms need to establish systems to account for\ntheir incomes and expenditures and pay tax. Secondly, taxes impose costs on the community where they distort behaviour —\ntaxes vary significantly in this regard, but state government taxes tend to be less efficient than for other levels of government.\nMore information on these costs can be found in Nassios et al. 2019.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 286", "text_len": 4358, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Where possible the\nanalysis has drawn from publicly available information and industry intelligence, but assumptions are yet to be fully\ntested with stakeholders.\nNevertheless, apart from the safety assumptions, key assumptions are consistent with initial consultations and\nsubmissions from stakeholders.\nNo assessment has been made of individual projects. Rather impacts are assumed to play out uniformly across all\nsites.\nWhile every effort to consider impacts has been made, not all direct and indirect impacts have been estimated. For\nexample, the indirect impacts of higher wages on demand have not been estimated. Similarly, any demand-side\nimpacts from additional expenditures on BPIC projects have not been included in this analysis.\nThese excluded impacts are unlikely to significantly change the results of the modelling.\nProjects in scope\nGiven the indicative nature of the analysis, the modelling uses a possible pool of future projects to assess the\nimpacts of BPICs. Given there are some uncertainties about which projects would have been covered by BPICs, and\nwhich projects are likely to proceed, there is some subjectivity about selecting projects to include in the modelling.\nThe following methodology has been used to determine the projects in scope:\n• Only projects from 2024–25 to 2029–30 have been considered. Existing projects are included in the analysis, but\nonly those expenditures occurring after June 30, 2023.\n• Possible infrastructure projects for inclusion have been sourced from Deloitte Access Economics’ (DAE)\nInvestment Monitor for December 2024 (DAE 2024), and were cross checked with publicly available information.\n• BPICs are assumed to apply to all government projects where total construction costs are expected to exceed\n$100 million or had already been a declared as a BPICs site.\n• $7.1 billion in Olympic and Paralympic Games infrastructure projects. The projects included are based on DAE’s\nInvestment Monitor, which predates the Games Independent Infrastructure and Coordination Authority’s 100-\nday Olympic and Paralympic Games infrastructure review (Games Independent Infrastructure Coordination\nAuthority 2025)\n• All electricity generation projects under consideration from 2026 have been included in the assessment.\n• Energy transmission and storage projects expected to commence after 2026 have also been included.\n• All other State Government projects in the DAE’s investment list were assumed to be in scope whether they\nwere listed as under construction, committed, under consideration or possible.\n• Projects listed as possible, but that had not been costed, were excluded from the analysis.\n• Project expenditures were allocated evenly across time based on their expected starting and completion times.\nWhere start and completion times were not provided in the DAE Investment Monitor:\n– where available, expected commencement and completions times were sourced from relevant publicly\navailable information (e.g. press releases, Department of Transport and Main Roads planning summaries)\n– where no publicly available information was available, projects start times were chosen to provide a spread of\nexpenditures over the out years (2028–2030).\nApproximately $77 billion in Queensland Government projects is assumed to be in scope (Figure C.2). This value is\nlikely to underestimate projects that would have been subject to BPICs, given the 2025-26 State Budget estimates.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 288", "text_len": 3701, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This is consistent with ABS employee earning data, which although an imperfect measure,\nsuggest that industry pay rates are above the minimum award rates (but lower than BPIC rates).\nQueensland Productivity Commission 290\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  |  |  | BPICs wage |  |  | Award wage |  |  | Difference | \nElectrician - apprentice, adult, year 2 |  |  | $55 |  |  | $27 |  |  | 105% |  | \nElectrician - grade 4 |  |  | $70 |  |  | $30 |  |  | 132% |  | \nElectrician - grade 7 |  |  | $80 |  |  | $38 |  |  | 114% |  | \nElectrician grade 10 |  |  | $92 |  |  | $42 |  |  | 119% |  | \nConstruction worker- apprentice, adult, year 2 |  |  | $51 |  |  | $24 |  |  | 114% |  | \nConstruction worker - level 3 |  |  | $69 |  |  | $31 |  |  | 123% |  | \nConstruction worker - level 6 |  |  | $75 |  |  | $33 |  |  | 125% |  | \nConstruction worker - level 9 |  |  | $80 |  |  | $36 |  |  | 126% |  | ", "text_len": 3537, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Further, there is no safety outcome data where direct comparisons can be made.\nNevertheless, the analysis considers two safety outcomes: worker fatalities and non-fatal serious injuries.\nAs shown in Table C.5, the construction industry has higher fatal and non-fatal injury claim rates than the whole-of-\neconomy average.\nTable C.5 Work related injury fatalities and serious claims, Queensland, 2021\nConstruction All industry average\nFatalities per 100,000 workers 2.1 1.6\nSerious injury claims per 1,000 employees 19.2 13.3\nSource: OIR 2022.\nBased on those differences, the analysis considers two scenarios:\n• In the high scenario, BPICs are assumed to bring fatalities and injuries down to the whole-of-economy average.\n• In the low scenario, BPICs are assumed to reduce fatalities to within 75 per cent of the whole-of-economy\naverage.\n59 VURM is a widely used Computable General Equilibrium model of the Australian and Queensland economies.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 291\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n | Low scenario |  |  | High scenario | \n30% higher |  |  | 50% higher |  | \n | Labour share of total costs – construction industry | \n23% |  | \n |  |  | Construction | All industry average\nFatalities per 100,000 workers |  |  | 2.1 | 1.6\nSerious injury claims per 1,000 employees |  |  | 19.2 | 13.3", "text_len": 2918, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 295, "text": "Appendices\nData and technical approach\nTo model the impact of weather-related stoppages, the following approach was taken:\n• Queensland weather station data containing hourly temperature, humidity, rainfall, and particulate matter levels\nwas sourced from the Queensland Government’s live air data portal.\n• BPICs projects were matched to their nearest weather station.\n• Rostered days off, weekends and scheduled holidays were removed from the data, and observations were\nlimited to between 6am and 4pm.\n• Weather conditions (for each scenario) were applied, such that if any relevant weather condition was met, work\nwould stop for the remainder of the day.\n• Data was aggregated to determine the total number of work hours lost, as a share of the total number of hours\navailable.\nIn some cases, relevant weather data was not available — for example, PM2.5 data is frequently not recorded. If\ndata was not available it was assumed that no relevant stoppage occurred for that site (for example, if no PM2.5 is\navailable for a site, it is assumed no material stoppages occurred).\nConversion to monetary values\nThe volume of reduced work hours was converted to monetary values by reducing the productivity of construction\nsites. That is, more labour and capital inputs are required to complete the same volume of work.\nOther project delays\nBPICs may also cause other project delays as they contain provisions for:\n• 26 RDOs, rather than the industry standard of 13 RDOs per year\n• less flexible RDO rostering, where RDOs on BPICs sites result in full site shutdowns\n• employees to attend daily, 2-hour union meetings and participate in other union activities.\nThe assessment of these provisions draws on observed market performance, evidence and feedback provided by\nstakeholders during the initial round of consultation and publicly available analysis, including industry reports.\nFor example, the Commission considered analysis, industry intelligence and stakeholder feedback to consider other\nimpacts of BPICs on site productivity and delays. Based on this information it suggests that on BPICs sites (and\nsites where BPICs conditions have been adopted):\n• RDOs must be all taken on the same day by all workers, meaning sites are shut down for 26 days per year. Prior\nto the introduction of BPICs, a worker was typically entitled to 13 RDOs, but it was common practice for workers\nto either not work the additional time required to accrue RDOs or to preference overtime payments over RDOs.\nThere was also flexibility on when and how RDOs are taken so that full site shutdowns were not required.\n• The use of work stoppage provisions (such as for union meeting attendance) is being used to disrupt work, and\nresults in contractors increasing tender prices to allow for increased risk. For example, if a stoppage occurs in\nthe middle of a concrete pour, this will result in the dumping of concrete and removal of any partially poured\nconcrete.\nAnalysis received by the Commission suggests that, on affected sites, there were around 96 working days lost due\nto the BPIC provisions (not counting for weather-related delays) in 2023-24, whereas the modelling assumes\nbetween 19 and 55 working days are lost each year under the low and high scenarios, respectively.\nThe assumptions used in this analysis, for the low and high scenarios, are provided in Table C.7.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 293", "text_len": 3396, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Conversely, the high scenario assumes a much stricter interpretation. However, even under the high scenario,\nimpacts may be lower than has been suggested by some industry stakeholders.\nSite flexibility\nBPICs also contains a range of other conditions that may be restricting site flexibility. These conditions include:\n• enforced quotas on trainees and apprentices\n• restricted use of overtime and shift work\n• restricted use of subcontractors and labour hire\n• reduced operation flexibility.\nAt the same time, one of the stated aims of BPICs is to facilitate positive, collaborative, and productive interactions\namong relevant stakeholders until successful project completion.\nThese conditions could therefore potentially have a positive impact on workplace productivity.\nThe literature on the impacts of unions on workplace productivity is mixed, with the evidence suggesting that\nunions harm productivity where they result in the sub-optimal deployment of labour, for example by excessively\nrestricting on-site practices, but may enhance productivity where they promote workplace harmony, reduce\nturnover or allow improved communication between workers and management (Bath et al. 2020; Doucouliagos &\nLaroche 2003).\nFor this reason, the modelling assumes BPICs would either have a mildly positive effect or mildly negative impact,\ndepending on how strictly the conditions are applied Table C.8.\nTable C.8 Assumed productivity impacts (not already considered)\nLow scenario High scenario\n1% -1%\nSource: QPC assumptions.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 294\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  | Assumption used |  |  |  | \n |  | Low scenario |  |  | High scenario | \nAdditional RDOs | 13 site days lost |  |  | 13 site days lost |  | \nImpact from less flexible RDOs | No impact |  |  | 6.5 site days lost |  | \nNumber of union meetings per week | 0.5 (equivalent to 6 site days) |  |  | 2 (equivalent to 24 site days) |  | \nDays lost due to increased union activity | No impact |  |  | 6 site days lost |  | \nDays lost due to less flexible work\narrangements (weekends) | No impact |  |  | 4.8 site days lost |  | \nTotal site days lost | 19 |  |  | 55 |  | \n | Low scenario |  |  | High scenario | \n1% |  |  | -1% |  | ", "text_len": 2847, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 297, "text": "Appendices\nApproach for indirect effects\nResidential housing market\nThere are two main mechanisms through which BPICs are likely to impact the residential market:\n• because BPICs projects require more labour, all other things held fixed, they reduce the number of construction\nworkers available to undertake residential construction work\n• a flow-through of BPIC conditions to larger, competing construction sites — stakeholder feedback suggests that\ntight labour market conditions, and the fact that many firms operate the same workforce across both\ngovernment and non-government projects, has meant that firms operating on high-rise projects have needed to\nenter into EBAs with the same conditions as BPICs.\nThe reduction in workers available to the residential market is estimated from the modelling of direct impacts\ndiscussed above. As noted above, there are numerous conditions where additional workers will be required to\ncomplete projects. For example, the requirement for additional RDOs under BPICs is assumed to result in\nadditional demand for workers to keep projects progressing. Similarly, there are numerous requirements in BPICs\nfor additional labour force to meet health and safety and union requirements (such as a requirement for separately\nemployed union delegates).\nThe estimated workforce impacts of BPIC conditions are presented in Table C.9.\nTable C.9 Estimated workforce impacts – per cent reduction in tradespeople for residential work\n2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28 2028-29 2029-30\nLow scenario 0.6% 1.3% 1.9% 1.8% 1.2% 0.5%\nHigh scenario 2.2% 4.9% 6.7% 6.3% 4.0% 1.6%\nSource: QPC estimates.\nReductions in workforce availability are assumed to have a disproportionate effect on delay times.

This means that delay times are likely to be greater\nthan implied by any reduction in worker availability (that is the relationship is not one for one).\nGiven the current tightness in the construction market, the modelling assumes a 1 per cent decline in workforce\ncauses residential construction times to increase by 2 per cent.60\nIn line with evidence provided in stakeholder submissions, the modelling assumes BPICs encourage the roll-out of\nBPICs-like conditions onto high-rise residential construction sites.\nAlthough it seems likely that BPICs have encouraged BPICs-like conditions to be taken up in other parts of the\nresidential market, the modelling does not include any assessment outside of the high-rise market.\nIn the absence of other information, this analysis uses the cost and delay times for high-rise residential projects\nnoted in stakeholder feedback.\nThese are listed in Table C.10 and are broadly in line with other market intelligence gathered by the Commission.\n60 To the best of the Commission's knowledge there are no empirical studies examining the relationship between trades\nshortages and construction times.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 295\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  |  |  | 2024-25 |  |  | 2025-26 |  |  | 2026-27 |  |  | 2027-28 |  |  | 2028-29 |  |  | 2029-30 | \nLow scenario |  |  | 0.6% |  |  | 1.3% |  |  | 1.9% |  |  | 1.8% |  |  | 1.2% |  |  | 0.5% |  | \nHigh scenario |  |  | 2.2% |  |  | 4.9% |  |  | 6.7% |  |  | 6.3% |  |  | 4.0% |  |  | 1.6% |  | ", "text_len": 3292, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

That is, the\nmodel assumes this will result in 13,200 fewer rental properties than would otherwise be the case.\nThe impact on house prices is determined by applying an estimate of the elasticity of supply, sourced\nfrom the RBA (Saunders & Tulip 2019), which suggests that for each 1 per cent reduction in supply,\ndwelling prices will increase by 2.5 per cent.\nThe impacts on rental prices are determined in the same way, but the elasticity of supply was empirically\nestimated with respect to vacancy rates (see Appendix C2 for details on the model).\nThe BPICs-induced change to the vacancy rate is estimated by projecting historical rental stock and rental\ndemand in the base case and then subtracting the BPICs-induced change in rental stocks (i.e. the 13,200\nfewer rental properties discussed above). Demand is assumed to be the same under the base case and\nBPICs scenarios.\nUnder the high scenario, these assumptions result in rents being 8.3 per cent higher than they would be\notherwise.\nBusiness investment\nBPICs are likely to affect business investment in much the same way as the residential market.

For example, if a school or road is delayed, this will impose costs on the community in\nthe form of reduced educational outcomes or increased congestion.\nIdeally, the impact of project delays would be estimated on a case-by-case basis, since the impact of a school delay\nis likely to be different from the impact of a road delay. Estimating impacts on a case-by-case basis is, however,\nbeyond the scope of this analysis.\nInstead, project delay costs have been approximated by applying a single assumed benefit ratio to all projects.\nThese have been estimated as follows:\n• an average NPV of the expected future benefits for all projects is estimated with project benefits spread over a\nbenefit time horizon (20 years)\n• a project delay is introduced, pushing out benefits by the expected delay\n• a new NPV of the future benefits is estimated\n• the cost is the difference between the expected NPVs of future benefits.\nAverage project benefits are estimated from Infrastructure Australia’s annual performance statement (2024a, p. 9),\nwhich provides an assessment of average expected project returns for projects in their portfolio.\nProject delays are estimated to reduce project benefits by between 1 per cent (low scenario) and 3.9 per cent (high\nscenario).\nTable C.13 Assumptions used to estimate costs to the community from project delays\nLow scenario High scenario\nAverage project delay 5% 20%\nAverage project benefit-cost ratio 1.2 1.2\nAverage benefit horizon 20 years 20 years\nAverage construction time 3 years 3 years\nDiscount rate 7% 7%\nSource: QPC assumptions.\nResults\nProject cost increases\nThe modelling implies that BPICs will increase project costs by 10.1 per cent for the low scenario (where BPICs are\nmore loosely enforced and interpreted) and 24.6 per cent for the high scenario (where BPICs are more strictly\nenforced and interpreted).\nThe estimated cost increases for each component are shown in Table C.14.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 299\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  |  |  | Low scenario |  |  | High scenario | \nAverage project delay |  |  | 5% |  |  | 20% |  | \nAverage project benefit-cost ratio |  |  | 1.2 |  |  | 1.2 |  | \nAverage benefit horizon |  |  | 20 years |  |  | 20 years |  | \nAverage construction time |  |  | 3 years |  |  | 3 years |  | \nDiscount rate |  |  | 7% |  |  | 7% |  | ", "text_len": 2486, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Depending on the\nvariable chosen, this can have a sizable impact on the results. Uncertainty on the modelling inputs has been mainly\ndealt with by varying assumptions under the low and high scenarios. However, the Commission also:\n• Conducted a sensitivity test where wage rates on BPICs sites were assumed to be no higher than on non-BPICs\nsites. The analysis shows that even with wage impacts omitted, BPICs are expected to impose net economic\ncosts on the community of between $4.4 billion (under the low scenario) and $18.4 billion (under the high\nscenario).\n• Varied other assumptions by + and – 20 per cent — while this varied the magnitude of impacts, it did not\nchange the key findings of the modelling. That is, under all scenarios conducted, BPICs have a large and\nnegative impact on the community, with net costs being imposed on the community.\nConclusion\nWhile BPICs provide substantial direct benefits for construction workers — primarily in the form of higher wages\nand greater leisure time — modelling suggests these are more than offset by direct costs to the broader\ncommunity from more expensive and delayed infrastructure. The safety benefits for construction workers are also\nsmall relative to other costs, benefits, and transfers.\nMore broadly, the negative impact on housing supply caused by BPICs is likely to impose costs on renters (facing\nhigher costs and less secure housing) and prospective first home buyers (who face higher dwelling prices). In\ncontrast, landlords accrue large benefits from increased dwelling prices and higher rents.\nIn aggregate, the net cost of the policy over the period 2024–25 to 2029–30 years is expected to be between $5.7\nbillion and $20.6 billion dollars (in NPV terms).\nDespite significant uncertainty around the direct effects of BPICs, these results are sufficiently robust, as the\nCommission has conducted sensitivity analysis and uses inputs based on best available information and\nstakeholder feedback.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 302\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  |  |  | Low scenario |  |  | High scenario | \nConstruction workers |  |  | 5,506 |  |  | 11,104 |  | \nTaxpayers |  |  | -8,177 |  |  | -19,856 |  | \nCommunity |  |  | -725 |  |  | -2,901 |  | \nLandlords |  |  | 1,416 |  |  | 4,863 |  | \nExisting homeowners |  |  | 476 |  |  | 2,069 |  | \nRenters and first home buyers |  |  | -2,760 |  |  | -10,727 |  | \nBusinesses |  |  | -1,435 |  |  | -5,140 |  | \n | Total |  |  | -5,698 |  |  | -20,588 | ", "text_len": 3102, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

While rental bonds do not cover all properties, data on actual rents paid on the stock of\ndwellings is not available.\nThese rents are aggregated into a statewide index using a Törnqvist index, such that:\n1 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1\nΔlog𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 =∑𝑖𝑖∈{𝑆𝑆×𝐷𝐷×𝐵𝐵}�log𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−log𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1�×2�∑𝑗𝑗∈𝑆𝑆×𝐷𝐷×𝐵𝐵𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡+∑𝑗𝑗∈𝑆𝑆×𝐷𝐷×𝐵𝐵𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1�\nWhere is the median rent for period , and is a tuple representing a specific region (in ), dwelling type (in )\nand number of bedrooms (in ).\n𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 𝑅𝑅 𝑖𝑖 𝑆𝑆 𝐷𝐷\nThe two advantages of using a𝐵𝐵 Törnqvist index are that it:\n• better accounts for changes in the aggregate due to changes in the composition of the stock\n• is smoother (as true medians tend to cluster at increments of $25).\nAs a result, growth in the rental index is likely to be a more robust estimate of growth in rents without structurally\ndiffering from the median.\nVacancy rates are sourced from SQM Research and are seasonally adjusted using an X-13 ARIMA process. Seasonal\nadjustment is necessary to ensure consistency with the QRSIS data, which is already implicitly ‘seasonally adjusted’\nby using a rolling period.

The analysis considers the effects of zoning reforms that increase development rights in South East\nQueensland (SEQ). The analysis does not consider other supply constraints and assumes increased development\nrights translates into more housing supply and greater density in higher demand locations.\nAs such, the modelling is not intended to provide a forecast or projection of future dwelling supply. Rather it\nprovides an estimate of the potential benefits that could be achieved through planning reforms that increase\ndevelopment rights.\nThis appendix sets out key assumptions and results from that analysis.\nMethodological approach\nCBA is the most appropriate approach for analysing the impacts of reforms since it:\n• allows for consideration of impacts on all stakeholders\n• provides a well-accepted framework for showing how costs and benefits accrue to stakeholders\n• makes key assumptions transparent\n• allows consideration of public benefit.\nThe CBA undertaken by the Commission provides analysis of two stylised reform options. In practice, specific\nreform options would need to be considered in more detail than has been assessed in this study.\nThe CBA scenarios are designed to provide a sense of the likely scale of impacts of various reform mechanisms and\nhow the costs and benefits are likely to be distributed amongst key stakeholders.\nThe CBA covers only SEQ because:\n• land use regulations are more binding in SEQ because of the scarcity of land available for greenfield\ndevelopment and restrictions that generally prevent increased density\n• SEQ accounts for most of Queensland’s population (around 72 per cent) and has higher house prices\n• data on approved planning supply is available in SEQ but not for other regions.\nAll scenarios cover the period 2023 to 2043. Full data was available up to 2023.\nThe base case\nAll results are presented relative to a base case. The base case reflects a 'business as usual' scenario, where no\nchanges to zoning occur.\nCore and alternate scenarios\nGiven the uncertainties around each policy, the base case involves two scenarios:\n• a core scenario, which involves higher population growth and higher dwelling price growth, consistent with a\ntighter housing market\nQueensland Productivity Commission 308", "text_len": 2460, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "6.Interim Report - Opportunities to improve productivity of the construction industry.pdf", "page_num": 311, "text": "Appendices\n• an alternative scenario, which involves lower population growth and lower dwelling price growth.\nThe alternate scenarios assume that prices are more responsive to changes in dwelling supply. Population growth\nis sourced from the Queensland Government population projections under the medium growth scenario.\nThe higher price responsiveness and lower population projections in the alternate scenarios mean that fewer\ndwellings are required to remove ‘disequilibrium’ from the housing market — this makes policy responses more\nmuted, and net benefits somewhat lower under the alternate scenarios.\nDwelling construction\nNew dwelling commencements are based on a 10-year historical average of detached and attached\ncommencements per quarter.\nUnder the base case, dwelling stock is estimated to increase by roughly 577,000 dwellings by June 2043. Dwelling\nconstruction is assumed to be the same under both the core and alternative scenarios.\nThe spatial allocation of new dwellings is driven by historical trends but is constrained by planned capacity for each\nLGA. Capacity constraints are sourced from the Land Supply and Development Monitoring (LDSM) report (DSDMIP\n2022), and assumed to expand over time, based on historical trends.\nWhere projected supply hits a capacity constraint, dwellings are reallocated to the closest LGA with spare capacity.\nAs a result, some markets such as Brisbane are projected to exhaust planning supply, such that dwelling\nconstruction is reallocated to neighbouring LGAs with capacity.\nIt is also assumed that demolitions of existing stock continue to occur consistent with state trends.\nNew housing supply is disaggregated into attached and detached housing based on historical trends.\nPopulation\nGiven uncertainties about future population growth and the responsiveness of dwelling prices to housing supply, a\ncore and alternate scenario is considered for each policy option.\nThe CBA uses QGSO (2023) population projections for SEQ:\n• Core scenario: QGSO’s ‘high’ population projection series: the SEQ population is projected to grow from 4.0\nmillion people in June 2023 to 6.0 million people in June 2043 (equivalent to 2.08 per cent per annum61).\n• Alternative scenario: QGSO’s ‘medium’ population projection series: the SEQ population grows more slowly at\n1.52 per cent annually to 5.4 million in June 2043.\nOver time, the average SEQ household size is projected to continue to decrease in line with historical trends —\ndecreasing by 0.1 persons by 2043 in both scenarios.\nPrice growth\nAs the number of dwellings supplied under both base case scenarios is the same, the differences in population\ngrowth underpin different price outcome assumptions. Given fixed industry supply in the base case, prices grow\nmore slowly under the lower population growth scenario.\nKey price assumptions are:\n• Core scenario: Price index grows by 65 per cent on average of the historical price increase 230 per cent that\noccurred from September 2000 to December 2022 (150 per cent).\n• Alternative scenario: Price index grows by 65 per cent of the observed historical price increase 138 per cent, that\noccurred from September 2000 to September 2019 (90 per cent). The period of strong prices growth from\nSeptember 2019 to December 2022 is excluded which reduces prices growth in SEQ.\n61 SEQ population growth was 2.17 per cent over the past 20 years and 1.88 per cent over the past 10 years.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 309", "text_len": 3459, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This scenario allows more detached housing and\nless attached housing than policy 1.\nPolicy 1 increases housing supply relative to the base case, with a greater share of attached housing, and fewer\nnew detached housing on the urban fringe. Policy 2 also increases housing supply, but assumes a more dispersed\nallocation of new supply, with more attached and detached housing in all regions, except Lockyer Valley, Scenic\nRim and Somerset (compared to the base case).\nMarket responsiveness\nThe response of the market to the relaxation of planning restrictions is a key determinant of the number of\ndwellings supplied in each of the scenarios and the estimated net benefits (or costs) under each of the policy\nreform options.\nWhile the experiences of other jurisdictions can provide some guidance, there remains significant uncertainty\nconcerning the likely scale and nature of market responses to a relaxation of planning restrictions. To help\ndetermine the size of the market response, the following issues were considered:\n• the scale of the market response (new dwellings supplied) and the extent to which it is consistent with likely\ndemand for new dwellings given population projections and trends in household formation\n• the extent to which the market response infers plausible changes to key characteristics of the housing markets\nin SEQ (such as implied changes to household size, the rate of unoccupied dwellings and rental vacancies)\n• whether the scale of the response is consistent with observed responses in other jurisdictions that have\nundertaken similar reforms\n• recent reforms in New Zealand have been well studied and provide a useful case for the possible initial impacts\nof reforms on Queensland62\n• the extent to which changes to dwelling prices and supply cost are reasonable\n• The core scenarios assume prices respond to changes in dwelling stocks in line with estimates in the empirical\nliterature.63\n62 In Auckland where 75 per cent of land was upzoned, the number of attached dwellings consented per year in upzoned areas\nincreased from under 1,000 in 2016 to nearly 10,000 by 2021, while detached dwellings increased from 2,000 to 4,500\n(Greenaway-McGrevy & Phillips 2022, p. 6). Building permits more than doubled across the region and additional supply was\nestimated to be equivalent to 5 per cent of the dwelling stock. The assumed policy responses are lower than the Auckland\nexperience.\n63 For example, Saunders and Tulip (2019) surveyed a range of studies and considered that a 1 per cent change in housing stock\nwas associated 2.5 per cent, across international studies compiled by Girouard et al. (2006) the average elasticity was 2.5 per\ncent, while, Abelson et al. (2005) estimated a 1 per cent increase in housing stock leads to a 3.6 per decrease in prices in\nAustralia.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 311", "text_len": 3604, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The changes to consumer\nsurplus are calculated as the number of new dwellings due to the policy change, multiplied by the price change\n(relative to the base case). Changes in the prices of existing dwellings, however, are excluded since they result in\ntransfers (see below).\n• Infrastructure provision costs65 — including road, water, sewerage, telecommunications, energy and other\ninfrastructure. Base levels of infrastructure costs are sourced from Infrastructure Victoria (2019) and are inflated\nusing ABS producer price indexes (ABS 2023b). Based on historical trends, infrastructure costs are assumed to\ngrow at 0.2 per cent above CPI.\n• Productivity impacts — the spatial distribution of population, and particularly increased density of population\naround employment centres has been shown to have a positive effect on productivity. Research shows\neconomies of scale accrue as cities increase density (known as agglomeration effects) (Ahlfeldt & Pietrostefani\n2019a; Rosenthal & Strange 2004). This suggests a denser spatial distribution of dwellings closer to employment\ncentres would increase productivity and income (including wages). In line with empirical research, it is assumed\nthat each 1 per cent increase in density increases labour productivity by 0.04 per cent.\n• Amenity — apart from loss of sunshine from increased density, the direction of benefits and costs from changes\nto amenity are not clear.66 Given that the impact of overshadowing is likely to be a net cost, an estimate of the\nloss is included in the CBA. The estimate was derived by taking the estimated average loss per new property for\nAuckland developed by the PwC and Sense Partners (2021) study ($8,435 undiscounted), adjusting for the\nnumber of new attached dwellings under each policy option.\n• Transport costs — including travel-related greenhouse gas emissions, vehicle operating costs, air and noise\npollution, and travel time. Transport costs are estimated based on empirical estimates in Trubka et al. (2008) and\nexclude infrastructure. Transport costs differ for inner city development and fringe development. Transport costs\nare inflated from 2008 by the transport component of CPI.\n• Health benefits — higher density living typically allows more use of active transport (walking and biking). In line\nwith estimates from Zapata-Diomedi et al. (2019), increases in medium density housing is assumed to result in\nhealth benefits relative to lower density housing.\n• Carbon emissions — higher densities can reduce the carbon intensity of cities by reducing commuting times\nand reducing the energy use of dwellings. Consistent with the literature, we assume attached dwellings have\nlower emissions. Based on empirical estimates we assume that apartments have 20 per cent per capita lower\nemissions than detached dwellings, while townhouses, other dwellings and flats attached to other property have\n10 per cent lower emissions per person.\n• Implementation costs — are assumed to be $8 million for all policy options. These costs are higher than have\nbeen assumed in other similar CBA studies.\nThe policy scenarios are also likely to provide benefits to the construction industry and related supply chains since\nthey allow for a large increase in construction productivity and activity. These benefits, however, are difficult to\nestimate without considering whole of economy effects.\n64 Consumer surplus is the benefit accruing to consumers from an ability to purchase goods for less than they are willing to pay.\nIn this case, a consumer will derive a benefit if they can purchase a dwelling for less than they would be willing to pay. Given\ndwellings are a subsistence good, willingness to pay tends to be high.\n65 If it is provided efficiently, the provision of infrastructure should provide benefits at least as great as its cost. For this reason,\nthe cost and benefits of any infrastructure associated with new housing is assumed to net out. However, where the same\ninfrastructure can be provided more efficiently (such as when density rises), net benefits can arise since costs fall relative to\nbenefits.\n66 For example, increased density can lead to reductions in greenspace in one area but gains in another.\nQueensland Productivity Commission 312", "text_len": 4566, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

While the exclusion of these impacts may affect the headline estimates, the evidence suggests the costs\nand benefits are uncertain, but the magnitude of the impact is likely to be small (relative to the headline net\nbenefits).\nPolicy results\nThe two policies assume similar changes to dwelling supply in aggregate (up to 330,000 additional dwellings), but\nwith a different allocation of dwellings across regions and dwelling types.\nTable D.2 presents the impact of each policy option on dwelling stock and prices in SEQ over the twenty-year\nperiod to 2043.\nTable D.2 Dwelling stock and price changes in SEQ, 2043\nCore Alternate\nscenario scenario\nBase case Dwelling stock 2,170,601 2,170,601\nPer quarter additions 7,210 7,210\nDwelling price change +131% +77%\nPolicy 1 — Zoning reforms in well Dwelling stock 2,500,774 2,425,000\nlocated places\nPer quarter additions 11,337 10,201\nDwelling price change +67% +23%\nPolicy 2 — Dispersed planning reform Dwelling stock 2,498,229 2,428,440\nPer quarter additions 11,304 10,259\nDwelling price change +75% +20%\nSource: QPC.\nNote: Price changes are weighted averages from 2023 to 2043.\nThe additional dwellings supplied under each of the policy options results in an easing of dwelling price growth.\nBoth policies have similar broad impacts in in terms of reducing price growth compared with the base case.\nOptions that provide mechanisms for larger increases in the number of dwellings, result in a greater easing of\ndwelling price growth.\nPolicy 1, under the core scenario, reduces the projected increase in real prices by 64 per cent, compared with 56\nper cent for policy 2.

Benefits\nalso accrue to policy 2, but these are smaller in scale due to the more dispersed dwelling pattern.\nBenefits also accrue through improvements to productivity, transport and health.

For this\nreason, the transfers between new buyers (and renters) and sellers (and landlords) net out and are not included in\nthe headline net benefit estimates.\nWhile not contributing to the headline CBA results, these transfers are likely to be of significant policy interest,\nparticularly because regulations over several decades have altered the distribution of wealth and because they\nrepresent improvements in housing affordability.\nUnquantified costs and benefits\nLand use regulation reforms are likely to result in a range of impacts which cannot be readily quantified, due to\nlack of data or a lack of consensus in the literature whether impacts are likely to be positive or negative.\nFor example, while costs due to overshadowing have been included in the CBA, other amenity impacts, while\nimportant, are uncertain, subjective and can be either positive or negative, depending on the nature of\ndevelopment.68\nOne of the key concerns raised in relation to increased density is the impact on character values associated with\nlow density traditional tin and timber homes in Queensland.\nWhile potential impacts on character values have not been quantified, the impacts would have to be exceedingly\nlarge to offset the benefits estimated here. For example, every household in SEQ would need to be willing to pay\naround $35,000 to prevent density in character areas to offset the net benefit for policy option 1.\nSimilarly, concerns about a loss of greenspace with increased density are likely to be misplaced, and may reflect\nconcerns about how increases in density are achieved rather than increases in density per se. There is little\nevidence that regulatory restrictions on density have worked to preserve urban greenspace, and sprawl has seen\nsignificant loss of farmland, habitat and greenspace on the urban fringe. Further, most research shows that amenity\nis either unchanged or improves with greater density.\nThe CBA also does not consider benefits arising from more choice in housing markets or how increased density\nmay increase access to jobs, particularly for women and young people.\nSimilarly, access to services, access to labour markets, social outcomes, availability of greenspace, impacts on\ncommercial and industrial premises, and compliance and administrative costs associated with regulation have not\nbeen quantified.\n68 In general, the literature suggests increased density is associated with increased amenity.

Any deadweight\ntaxation and other benefits from reducing government expenditure (both program and administrative expenditure)\nhave not been quantified in this CBA.\nOverall, the Commission's assessment of the literature suggests that unquantified impacts are likely to provide\nbenefits greater than the costs.\nSensitivity testing\nSensitivity testing did not alter the key results — that is, that the policy scenarios produce large net benefits.\nSensitivity testing included adjustments to: the discount rate; population growth assumptions; initial estimates of\nthe gap between dwellings prices and the marginal physical costs of supply (the degree of current inefficiencies in\nthe housing market); dwellings price and cost growth assumptions under the base case; and demand and supply\nelasticities.\nConclusions\nQueensland’s housing market is currently experiencing high rents, vacancy rates at historic lows and home\nownership increasingly out of reach for aspiring buyers. The fundamental reason for this is that housing supply is\nnot keeping pace with demand.\nWhile there are many reasons for the lack of supply in the housing market, a key reason is that current zoning and\nland use regulation constrain the ability of the market to supply new housing. It restricts where housing can be\nbuilt, the forms of housing that may be built and the density.\nThe CBA presented here provides a stylistic analysis of policy options to relax land use regulation to permit higher\ndensity and increase the supply of dwellings in SEQ.\nThe primary purpose is to provide information on some of the trade-offs of different policy options, obtain a sense\nof the scale of potential net benefits, and explore the sensitivity of those net benefits to various assumptions.\nThe analysis shows two clear potential benefits of reform — increased dwelling stock, which improves housing\naffordability, and improved spatial distribution of housing, which improves productivity and reduces a range of\ncosts, particularly in constructing infrastructure.\nThe quantified impacts provide a clear indication that policy changes that facilitate increased density would\nprovide very large net benefits – depending on the policy option and the assumptions used, net benefits are\nestimated to be in the order of $18–$48 billion. The results hold under widely varying scenarios and are robust to a\nrange of assumptions.\nReforms would also likely benefit aspiring owners and renters, who would otherwise be facing significantly higher\ndwellings prices (and rents).\nSlower growth in dwelling prices may impact existing homeowners, but these are offset by the gains to new\nhomeowners and renters. These wealth transfers are likely to be in the order of $200 billion depending on the\npolicy option and assumptions adopted.\nLarge benefits from policy changes, in the order estimated in this paper, generally only ever arise where\nregulations have significantly impeded market responses to underlying changes in technologies, consumer\npreferences (valuations) and other conditions over a prolonged length of time.
