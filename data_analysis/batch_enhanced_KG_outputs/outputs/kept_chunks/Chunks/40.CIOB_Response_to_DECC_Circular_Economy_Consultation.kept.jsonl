Further, the demolition of existing buildings creates\nchallenges such as appropriate disposal of waste, dust exposure, and greenhouse gas emissions.\nRegulatory measures have proven effective in undergirding similar types of sectoral culture shifts from\ndemolish and rebuild to repair and reuse. For instance, landfill taxes and the application of an\naggregate levy facilitated a 70% decline in the amount of Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW)\ndisposed to landfills in the UK.1 International studies concluded that levies were more effective at CDW\nmitigation than financial incentives, achieving the targeted 30% reduction in CDW two years sooner\nand have the co-benefit of generating a new revenue stream.2\nGovernance\nThe issue of governance is crucial to a successful circular economy strategy. It is quite clear from the\ndiscussion document that the guidance will spill over into the remit of other departments – the\nDepartment of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and the Department of Finance are the most\nobvious, although there are others. As such, if the guidance is to evolve from a discussion document\ninto a set of clear policies, with concrete, enforced outcomes, other government departments need to\nbe brought on board. For instance, there is clear tension between what the guidance proposes, and"}

It is nonetheless important to recognise that, in some cases, this will not be practical or\npossible.\nIn cases where demolition is an appropriate course of action, waste audits conducted by external\nauditors ahead of demolition could further support the mitigation of Construction & Development\nWaste (CDW). Research has demonstrated that pre-demolition audits are an ‘effective tool for\nenhancing CDW management practices’.6 In some cases, an internal version of these audits is already\nin use. However, the practice has not been widely adopted. Further, concerns have been raised\nregarding self-regulation. Considering these limitations there is a need for mandatory auditing systems\nthat don’t rely upon the industry’s self-policing but rather engage with specialised staff with the\nnecessary training to provide objective assessments and oversee waste management practices.\nImplementing these assessment and auditing systems could further support redressing the imbalance\nbetween replacing and repairing buildings in Ireland7 and support transitioning to the principles of the\ncircular economy. However, these systems will require upskilling industry professionals to understand\nbetter CDW practices and the recycling and reuse of materials\nResourcing\nThe draft mentions a lot of new duties, some loaded onto the planning system.
