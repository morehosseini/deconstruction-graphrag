{"source_file": "36.Building and construction - Department of State Growth.pdf", "page_num": 2, "text": "Summary of sector\nThe building and construction industry comprises residential building, non-residential building, and engineering\nconstruction. The value of work done by these in 2011-12 was:\nResidential: $740 million\nNon-residential: $486 million\nEngineering: $1 016 million\nTotal: $2.24 billion\nThe sector’s economic activity is estimated to contribute approximately $1.249 billion (5.8 per cent) towards\nGross State Product1.\nThe Tasmanian building and construction sector has demonstrated a capacity to match the high levels of demand\nplaced on it in recent years, particularly as a result of economic stimulus funding following the global financial\ncrisis.\nFigures from the ABS Census 2011 indicate that employment in the sector rose in Tasmania by 25.7% between\n2006 and 2011. However, since the conclusion of stimulus initiatives in 2010-11, the building and construction\nworkforce in Tasmania has fallen to around 17 000 workers, with an associated fall in apprenticeship\ncommencements and training. Low economic growth, and rising levels of unemployment have not yet been offset\nby low interest rates, the First Home Builder Boost, or First Home Owner Grant, which ended on 30 June 2014.\nAccording to the latest Property Council/ANZ Property Industry Confidence Survey, on the back of the March 2014\nState election results, Tasmania’s property industry had a seven point jump in confidence. The eleventh survey,\nthe largest of its kind in the country, shows Tasmania’s property industry sentiment has jumped 32 points over\nthe last 12 months to sit for the first time in the survey’s history at 128 points for the June 2014 quarter. This\nreflects an improving economic outlook following two years of very weak conditions.\nThe Tasmanian Property Council report states that the new Liberal majority state government appears to be\nwinning the industry’s confidence in measures such as the $10 million water and sewerage headwork holiday and\nestablishment of the planning reform taskforce.\nWhile residential demand appears to be stabilising, non-residential or commercial demand, both private and\npublic, has seen successive declines over a number of quarters accompanied by a steady increase in office vacancy.\nEngineering construction has also declined, with the completion of nationally-funded projects coinciding with a\nlack of new activity, due to ongoing weak macroeconomic conditions. Activity in this area in the foreseeable\nfuture is likely to be supported mainly by road projects and infrastructure maintenance, as well as works\nassociated with the development of new mining activities on the West Coast and irrigation projects statewide.\nAustralian Government funding for the Hobart Airport runway, rail infrastructure and the Midland Highway\nupgrade will also provide opportunities for the engineering construction sector.\n1 The Property Council (AEC Group, Economic Significance of the Property Industry to the Tasmanian Economy, 22 August 2011)\nconsidered a broader scope, which included developers, real estate agents and rentals, for the ‘property sector’ and\nestimated it to contribute $2.5 billion towards Gross State Product (or 10.9 per cent) and directly employ 21 000 persons.\n2", "text_len": 3206, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "36.Building and construction - Department of State Growth.pdf", "page_num": 3, "text": "Constraints and opportunities\nConsultation with industry stakeholders in 2013 identified the following key constraints and opportunities:\nConstraints\n• Maintaining access to skilled workforce in workflow peaks and troughs.\n• High reliance on government-funded projects.\n• Interest rate volatility and impact of global finance markets.\n• Low levels of population growth.\n• Lack of resources to accelerate planning reform.\n• Low level of investor confidence.\n• Low level of government funding.\nOpportunities\n• Increased activity in the mining sector.\n• Low land cost relative to other states.\n• National Broadband Network rollout.\n• Potential for the renewable energy sector to expand.\n• Bringing forward projects in times of low interest rates.\n• Improved planning instruments.\n• Reduction of ‘red and green tape’.\n• Promotion and encouragement of innovation including the Innovation Award.\nIssu•e s f acing the sector\nThe Tasmanian building and construction sector operates within a relatively small market, and is therefore\nparticularly concerned with the ‘pipeline’ of projects over the foreseeable future, including approved building\nprojects, works programs and major projects.\nIndustry leaders believe a certain critical mass of activity in Tasmania is necessary to maintain industry capability\nand productivity. Falling below this critical mass is likely to exacerbate the decline in employment and the\noutward migration of skilled industry personnel. Industry feels government is best placed to take a lead in the\nstaging of projects to manage a minimum level of activity in the industry.\nFurther issues relevant to each component of the Tasmanian building and construction sector are outlined below:\nResidential building\nWhile market conditions for the residential sector in Tasmania improved over the December 2013 and March\n2014 quarters they remain soft in historical terms. In mid-2014, housing starts are around 2 000 dwellings per\nannum. Industry stakeholders state that in the past, housing starts have been around 2 500-3 000 dwellings per\nannum. The residential building industry is however, being supported by high levels of renovation activity.\n3", "text_len": 2165, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Looking forward,\nthere are several government-based capital works programs for roads and bridges underway, as well as\nanticipated mining and irrigation-related projects.\nThe engineering sector is highly capital-intensive, due to the requirement for specialised construction machinery\nand associated equipment. This results in it being less flexible and less able to sustain periods of low activity.\nStrategy summary\nIndustry strategy\nThe following priorities have been identified by industry:\nResidential building\n• develop a state population growth strategy, including the marketing of Tasmania to boost economic\ngrowth and building demand\n• ensure a competitive business operating environment, including tax, infrastructure and regulation, to\nsupport affordable housing\n• support regional land use strategies to provide direction for development\n• monitor land supply with greater regional strategic planning\n• monitor and improve planning and building approval processes (consistency and simplicity) minimising red\nand green tape\n• Investigate ways to reduce utilities headwork costs.\nNon-residential building\n• continue planning reform and restructuring to include planning assessments, tax reform and reduction of\nadministrative burden of compliance with regulation\n• smooth out the delivery of public investment over time\n• monitor land supply and release\n• consider interim planning and design to create development-ready sites\n• investigate ways to reduce utilities headwork costs\n4", "text_len": 2398, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
