With one of the fastest growing populations in Australia, Victoria needs to accelerate\nconstruction, while also introducing circular practices to improve material efficiency, lower waste and reduce\nassociated emissions. Given the inefficiencies relating to wasted valuable materials, and the cost of\nmanaging waste generated by the sector, there are significant opportunities for businesses in the building\nand construction sector to reduce negative impact and improve performance through embedding circular\neconomy principles.\nThe construction sector is one of the largest sources of managed waste in Australia, contributing 17% of all\nwaste produced in the country.2 According to Victoria's waste projection model, 6.7 million tonnes of\nconstruction and demolition waste was generated in Victoria in 2022–23.3 Despite recycling efforts, a\nsignificant portion still ends up in landfills, with about 16% of all waste generated by the construction sector\nhaving this fate.4 The cost of managing this amount of waste is considerable. The construction industry\nspends around $2 billion on waste services5 in Australia each year, highlighting the economic burden of\nwaste. These costs are rising and are expected to rise further as landfill space becomes scarcer, and the\ncost of managing each tonne of waste increases accordingly.\nIt is not only about waste. Building and construction uses large amounts of materials including concrete\ntimber, and steel among others. The consumption of these resources contributes to environmental and social\nharm. For example, the production of cement contributes to around 8% of global greenhouse gas\nemissions.6\nWith this in mind, the Victorian Government’s Circular Economy Business Innovation Centre investigated the\npotential of circular design within the built environment, including strategies, benefits and successful\napplications. The What Works for circular design in the built environment report showcases insights and case\nstudies and demonstrates how businesses stand to gain from effective circular design while delivering\neconomic and environmental outcomes for Victoria. The purpose of this report is to equip businesses with\nthe information they need to begin testing the circular design opportunities within their sphere of the built\nenvironment. This report also aims to equip policy makers operating within the built environment with an\nincreased understanding of circular design and the potential benefits that could be realised through its\nwidespread uptake.\nThe report focuses on five key circular design principles, with additional guidance on developing the\ninvestment case for circular design, including highlighting the triple bottom line (economic, social, and\nsustainable) advantages to business from embracing circular design. The report concludes with outlining key\nactions that can be taken across supply chains to mainstream circular design in the built environment.\nThe circular economy\nIn response to the high impact of the built environment sector, leading companies are increasingly adopting\nthe circular economy as a model that dramatically improves materials efficiency, reduces waste and unlocks\nvalue.\nThe circular economy is a system where materials never become waste and nature is regenerated. In a\ncircular economy, products and materials are kept in circulation through processes like maintenance, reuse,\nrefurbishment, remanufacture, recycling, and composting. The circular economy tackles climate change and\nother global challenges, like biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution, by decoupling economic activity from the\nconsumption of finite resources.7\nA circular economy continually seeks to reduce environmental impacts of production and consumption while\nenabling economic growth through more productive use of natural resources.

More than 70% of a building’s\nlifecycle environmental impact is determined during the design phase.11 It is therefore critical to consider\ncircular design opportunities during the design phase to minimise environmental impacts and avoid waste in\nthe built environment over the entire building lifecycle.\nWhat is Circular Design in the Built Environment?\nCircular Design in the Built Environment is a specific design approach that seeks to incorporate circular\neconomy principles throughout the design and total asset lifecycle of buildings and/or structures. It focuses\non designing products and systems to minimise waste and maximise resource utilisation by keeping\nmaterials in use for as long as possible, promoting reuse, repair, and recycling, and ultimately regenerating\nnature.\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a leader in circular economy thinking, states that for buildings and\nconstruction, applying circular economy principles can reduce the embedded carbon emissions from\nconstruction materials by 38% by 2050.12 For example, ensuring that steel is recycled (through avoiding\ncontamination) and that more value is generated through the design and application of steel, would avoid\n500 Mt of additional primary steel production by 2050 and in doing so, reduce CO2e emissions by more than\n1 billion tonnes of CO2e per year.13\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation outlines three principles of a circular economy (see Error! Reference s\nource not found.) that can be applied directly to the design and construction phase of a built structure.14\nThese principles (and the focus of this report) include:\n1. Design out waste and pollution – being efficient with materials use through good design (for example\nspecific of sizing that reduces offcuts) and using low toxic materials (low VOC components) during the\nconstruction, operation, and end of life phase of a building or structure.\n2. Keep products and materials in use, at their highest value – design to enable and facilitate the\ncirculation of building products and materials, at their highest value, for as long as possible.\n3. Regenerate natural systems – for example by specifying certified sustainable materials (e.g. timber\nfrom sustainable forests) as an alternative to extraction of finite materials.\n11 Zhou, Y et al (2020) Design variables affecting the environmental impacts of buildings: A critical review, Journal of Cleaner Production,\nVolume 387.\n12 Ellen Macarthur Foundation. www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/climate/overview\n13 Ellen Macarthur Foundation.

However, approximately 45% of global emissions remain to be\naddressed.\nThese emissions predominantly arise from the extraction and production of materials, products and food.\nCompared to the energy transition, reducing emissions from these sources involves changes to more\nsystems and is therefore more complex. The Completing the Picture report proposes that transforming from\na linear economy model to a circular economy is essential if achievement of net zero emissions by 2050 is to\nbe attained.\nThe built environment is a large consumer of materials and products and therefore embedding circularity\nwithin the built environment lifecycle becomes a key contribution to global efforts to achieve net zero\nemissions by 2050 or earlier.\nHow the Victorian Government is supporting Circular Design in the Built\nEnvironment\nVictoria can be a global leader in Circular Design in the Built Environment.

A new build may be more carbon and resource\nintensive than strategies that involve creatively re-using existing structures, products and materials.\nRelevant Circular Economy Principle: keep products and materials in use, at their highest value.\nDesign Actions\n• Incorporate existing materials or components into a retrofit, renovation, or repair project, to achieve\neither the same, or a new function.\n• Separate and/or remove potential sources of contamination.\n• Transfer intact materials or components for reuse off-site, if they cannot be used on site.\nBenefits:\n• Prolong the life of existing materials and products\nRetrofitting and reusing materials helps optimise their lifespan, reducing the demand for new\nresources. This is crucial in conserving natural resources and minimising the environmental impacts\nassociated with resource extraction and manufacturing.\n• Reduce use of virgin materials compared to new builds\nReusing existing materials significantly diminishes the need for new production, reducing the\nassociated environmental impacts such as deforestation, mining, and energy-intensive manufacturing\nprocesses.\nBy minimising the reliance on virgin materials, the overall waste generated from construction activities\ncan be reduced, promoting a more sustainable and circular approach to resource use.\n• Reduce upfront building costs\nWhile projects need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, retrofitting and reusing existing\nstructures can result in cost savings compared to constructing new buildings. Depending on the extent\nof work required, retrofitting can decrease the need for new materials, and the cost of demolition and\nwaste management.\nLower upfront costs enhance the feasibility of projects, making sustainable practices more accessible\nto a broader range of clients and communities.\n• Reduced embodied carbon\nRetrofitting and reusing structures generally have a lower carbon footprint compared to new\nconstruction, as they involve fewer energy-intensive processes and reduce the need for transporting\nand manufacturing new materials.\nEmbodied carbon refers to the total greenhouse gas emissions generated during the entire lifecycle of\nbuilding materials, from extraction and manufacturing to transportation and installation.

These 15 studio,\nthree-story apartment blocks underwent a sustainable retrofit, involving upgrades to apartments, communal\nspaces and outside spaces.\nCircular Design Features\nThe project initially incorporated several Circular Design elements, including:\n• Reduced use of virgin materials and resources. The project illustrates how retrofit and reuse\nstrategies can dramatically reduce virgin material and product requirements typically associated with\nnew builds. For example, the existing double brick structure, the hallway handrails, door frames,\njoinery handles, stair balustrades, and fuse box were all retained.\n• Reuse and recycling materials on site was a top priority. During the initial demolition process, all\nmaterials were catalogued and stored for reuse. These strategies were estimated to reduce\nconstruction waste by up to 80%. For example, the existing roof sheeting was repurposed as fencing\non around the site, and the former kitchen tiles were reused in the new communal laundry area.\n• Consideration was given to best practice operational waste management. For example, a communal\ncompost system was installed in an accessible location for all apartments. If used regularly, it has the\npotential to reduce operational waste to landfill by 60%.\n• Commitment to recycle all materials that could not be reused or repurposed. All aluminium, glass,\nmetal, plaster, timber, and concrete waste that could not be retained was separated and recycled.\nFigure 3: The material selection hierarchy used by building stakeholders on the project\nWhat Worked\nWhat Worked\nMaking Circular All project stakeholders were committed to circular material selection principles\nDesign a priority from the start of the project and incorporated this into initial project feasibility\nfrom the start assessment.

It also involves getting the most out of materials used. Material efficiencies can be\nachieved through efficient construction techniques and design choices that, for example, maximise the use of\nthe entire space, or eliminate unnecessary materials.\nCircular Economy Principles: Design out waste and pollution.\nDesign actions:\n• Increase the functional use of the entire asset, through designing for multi-use or increasing the use\nof often empty spaces – e.g. meeting rooms or break-out spaces in office.\n• Avoid unnecessary structures or finishes.\n• Use efficient construction techniques such as prefabrication and modular methods.\n• Use efficient and innovative engineering techniques (for example computer aided design and material\nplanning).\n• Avoid, if possible, material intensive designs such as high-rise or building underground in favour or\nlow or medium rise.\n• Minimise wastage during construction through design and efficient ordering/stock management.\nBenefits:\n• Reduce embodied carbon emissions\nDesigning for material efficiency involves careful consideration of the materials used in construction,\nresulting in reduced embodied carbon emissions. By minimising unnecessary material consumption\nand waste, the overall carbon footprint associated with the manufacturing and transportation of\nmaterials is decreased.\nUsing efficient construction techniques, such as prefabrication and modular methods, further reduces\nenergy-intensive processes and contributes to a more sustainable Built Environment.\n• Minimise extraction of new resources\nDesigning for material efficiency reduces the demand for natural resources such as water, energy and\nwood. This in turn helps to reduce the ecological impacts of resource extraction such as habitat loss,\ngreenhouse gas emissions and pollution.\n• Reduce upfront material costs\nMaterial efficiency in design not only benefits the environment, but also leads to economic advantages.\nBy reducing the overall material requirements, projects can experience lower upfront material costs,\nmaking sustainable construction practices more economically viable and accessible.\nMinimising material costs enhances the financial viability of projects, making them more appealing to a\nwider range of clients and stakeholders.

This can involve intelligent\nproduct choice and construction techniques, but also designing to ensure the asset is adaptable to meet\nchanging needs or conditions over time. Building for durability, in some cases, may involve a trade-off in\nterms of upfront material efficiencies and embodied carbon, but generally results in favourable outcomes\nover the entire lifecycle.\nCircular Economy Principle: Design out waste and pollution.\nDesign actions:\n• Design with durable materials and components with guaranteed longevity, preferably beyond the life\nof the planned asset, so they can be adapted and reused. This needs to be supported by appropriate\nconstruction practices.\n• Investigate product as a service19 option for components. Product as a service provides an incentive\nfor the product to have a longer life as ownership is retained by the producer.\n• Design for easy repair and maintenance.\n• Design to ensure asset can be easily adapted to meet evolving needs over time.\n• Design for future climate conditions, considerations should include adapting designs to account for\nanticipated climate changes, ensuring that structures remain resilient and functional in changing\nenvironmental conditions. For more details, refer to the Built Environment Adaptation Action Plan. 20\nBenefits\n• Reduced embodied carbon (over life of asset)\nDesigning for long-term use involves selecting durable materials and components that can withstand\nthe test of time. While there might be an initial trade-off in terms of upfront material efficiencies, the\noverall embodied carbon emissions can be reduced over the life of the asset. This is because a longer-\nlasting structure requires fewer replacements and renovations, leading to lower carbon-intensive\nactivities throughout its lifecycle.\n• Reduce material footprint (over life of asset)\nThe use of durable materials and components, along with a focus on adaptability, can reduce the\nmaterial footprint over the life of the asset. This approach minimises the need for frequent\nreplacements or major renovations, thereby conserving resources and reducing the environmental\nimpact associated with ongoing material extraction and production.\n• Reduced costs (over life of the asset)\nWhile there might be an initial investment in durable materials, designing for long-term use often results\nin significant cost savings over the life of the asset. Reduced maintenance and replacement costs,\ncoupled with enhanced resilience to changing needs or conditions, contribute to a financially efficient\nand sustainable approach to building design.\nThe longevity and adaptability of a structure designed for long-term use contributes to an increased\nreturn on investment, as the asset remains functional and valuable for an extended period. This\neconomic benefit aligns with the broader goals of sustainable and financially viable construction.\n• Higher sale and/or rental income\nThe factors that make a building have a longer expected life, such as the quality of materials and\nconstruction can be reflected in a higher asking price on the market (where market conditions allow).\n19 Product as a service refers to a business model where instead of selling a product outright, companies offer it as a service.

In the context of this\nstrategy, we are focussed on incorporating reused, recycled, and/or renewable materials and components\nwithin the design. This strategy also involves incorporating materials or products with minimal impact on the\nenvironment. This approach aims to reduce virgin material footprints and contribute to ‘closing the loop’\nwithin the broader Built Environment sector.\nA caveat is that each material must be assessed on its own merit rather than make generalisations that\ncertain classes of material are sustainable. For example, not all renewable sources are sustainable. The\nsustainability of a particular material depends on the way it is produced, how durable it is in a particular\napplication and how it is disposed.\nCircular Economy Principles: keep products and materials in use & regenerate natural systems.\nDesign actions:\n• Maximise use of reclaimed materials or products.\n• Incorporate materials or products made from recycled content or those with low embodied carbon.\nFor example noise walls along the side of Melbourne’s freeways are being made from recycled milk\nbottles, soft drink bottles and soft plastics. In addition, a Buy Recycled Directory21 lists hundreds of\nVictorian products and materials made using recycled materials. These range from construction to\ninterior fit out materials and products.\n• Incorporate renewable/bio-based materials into the design concept (where these can be sustainably\nsourced). Some examples of common bio‑based materials are timber, straw (which can be made\nfrom agricultural waste), hemp, cork, clay, and earth. Make sure that renewable and bio-based\nmaterials are sustainably sourced. Look for independent, third party sustainability certification to\nconfirm sustainability benefits rather than rely on supplier’s claims.\nBenefits\n• Reduced embodied carbon emissions\nDesigning with reused, recycled, and renewable materials prioritises options with lower embodied\ncarbon. By incorporating sustainable alternatives, the overall carbon footprint of the construction\nproject is reduced, contributing to climate mitigation efforts.\n• Reduced extraction of non-renewable resources\nUsing reclaimed, recycled, and renewable materials minimises the reliance on non-renewable\nresources. This approach helps conserve natural resources, reduce environmental degradation, and\nmitigates the negative impacts associated with the extraction of finite resources.\n• Improved health outcomes\nChoosing sustainable materials often involves opting for non-toxic and low-emission alternatives. This\ncontributes to better indoor air quality and reduces occupants' exposure to harmful substances,\npositively impacting health and well-being.\n• Reduced waste to landfill from demolition sites\nBy incorporating reused and recycled materials, there is a significant reduction in the amount of waste\ngenerated during demolition and construction activities. This aligns with the principles of a circular\neconomy by minimising the environmental impact of construction-related waste.\n• Creating a new market for circular products\nDesigning with sustainable materials contributes to the creation of a market for circular products,\nfostering innovation and encouraging the development of more environmentally friendly alternatives.\nThis, in turn, supports the growth of a circular economy within the broader Built Environment sector.\n21 Sustainability Victoria.

It involves a design philosophy that allows for\nthe systematic dismantling of a product or structure at the end of its life, without compromising the integrity of\nits constituent materials or components. By doing so, it promotes effective value retention through the\npossibilities of reuse or recycling. Additionally, this strategy underscores the importance of selecting\nmaterials that are not only durable but also easily able to be recycled or repurposed ensuring that the\nmaterials themselves can continue to contribute to a circular economy even after the asset's initial lifecycle\nends.\nCircular Economy Principles: Design out waste and pollution & keep products and material in use at\nhighest value.\nDesign actions:\n• Work with the supply chain to incorporate ‘product as a service’ options where possible (for example\nplant and equipment).\n• Plan for end-of-life disassembly to maximise reuse and recycling from the outset.\n• Specify materials and products that are easy to disassemble e.g., modular.\n• Use connection systems and construction methods that enable disassembly.\n• Avoid use of composite materials that are difficult or harmful to disassemble.\nBenefits\n• Enhanced Material Recovery\nProduct as a service business models (where the user buys the utility of the product rather than the\nasset itself) can increase the likelihood of materials or components being recovered at the end of the\nasset's life. This is because the producer retains ownership of the product and has incentive to re-use\nproducts and materials. This aligns with the waste hierarchy principles, prioritising reuse over recycling,\nand contributes to a more circular and sustainable approach to material management.\n• Resource Conservation\nMaximising material recovery reduces the need for extracting new resources, promoting a more\nresource-efficient and environmentally responsible approach. This supports the conservation of natural\nresources and minimises the environmental impact associated with resource extraction.\n• Economic Efficiency\nProduct as a service options may lead to more efficient use of resources and materials which can lead\nto economic benefits for either suppliers or buyers over the long term. This can be through optimising\nsupplier operations from increased certainty of supply, reducing costs associated with material\nprocurement, and potentially creating new revenue streams. Since the product remains the property of\nthe supplier, disposal costs are internalised to the supplier and incentivise re-use, refurbish or recycled\nthe product.\n• Waste Minimisation\nDesigning for material recovery minimises the amount of waste generated at the end of an asset's life.\nThis is crucial in adhering to waste hierarchy principles, where the emphasis is placed on reducing,\nreusing, and recycling materials before resorting to disposal in landfills.\nWhat Works example – WSP Arden Precinct\nThe Arden Precinct, North Melbourne, will see the establishment of a sustainable and forward-thinking\ninnovation precinct that sets the standard for best practice in sustainable urban renewal.\nWSP’s22 Waste & Circular Economy team worked in collaboration with the City of Melbourne to provide\nstrategic waste engineering and circular economy advice, and to develop a precinct wide waste management\nplan that exceeds current Australian Standards in sustainable waste management.

Nevertheless, it is\nencouraging to learn that recent surveys of stakeholders across the Australian Built Environment sector have\nfound that the economic costs of adoption are no longer believed to be a significant barrier in the Australian\ncontext.24 A survey of participants in the Built Environment sector has found that raising awareness of the\nbusiness benefits of Circular Design is a key enabler to advancement.25\nTo assist develop the business case for Circular Design this section highlights some of the potential triple\nbottom line (economic, social, and sustainable) advantages to business from embracing Circular Design.\nFinancial opportunities\nThere is now a strong emerging business case for the Built Environment sector to embrace Circular Design\nactions.26 Circular Design can involve higher costs, particularly in the design and construction phase, partly\nsince it is a relatively new approach for the Built Environment sector, and partly since in some cases,\nmaterials and techniques can involve higher upfront costs. However, there is now a strong evidence-base27\nhighlighting potential financial benefits of Circular Design, especially in consideration of the entire lifecycle of\na building and its constituent materials and products.\nTable 2 highlights some of these opportunities, based on a review of expert literature and interviews with\nBuilt Environment sector stakeholders. These opportunities – such as those during the operational and end\nof life phases – are far more likely to be captured through effective Circular Design of a building or structure.\nIt is important to acknowledge that difficulties exist in capturing some of these benefits using existing markets\nand regulatory frameworks. For example, financial incentives may be split across different builders, owners\nand tenants across the life of an asset. While tenants may save operating costs by leasing a more energy\nefficient space, this may not translate to a higher willingness to pay the building owners who initially\ndetermine the level of energy efficiency. Another example is where the builder owner/developer has little or\nno incentive to optimise the building for renovation or disassembly as they are likely to sell the building after\nrefurbishment rather than own it until end of life.\nAs such, businesses in the Built Environment sector need to be able to rigorously evaluate and demonstrate\nthese opportunities on a case-by-case basis. Supported by suitable tools (e.g. standards, regulated\ndisclosures, contracts that align incentives), the benefits in Table 2 point to the financial potential of\nembracing Circular Design for business in the Built Environment sector.\n24 Ibid, p.63\n25 Shooshtarian et al (2022).

Reducing\nvirgin resource in favour of circular materials can reduce impacts to\nland, air and water, including climate change impacts.\n– Reduced waste production – designing out waste through Circular\nDesign strategies can result in reduced waste generation across the\nlifecycle of the built asset. The environmental benefits of reducing waste\ninclude land use and potential for contamination from landfills, and the\nwaste of valuable and resource intensive products and materials.\nSocial Value – New Employment Opportunities – Incorporating Circular Design\nrequires specialist skills and strategies such as repair provide local\nskilled jobs compared to importing new goods.\n– Improved health and safety outcomes – Circular Design considers\ntoxicity of materials and therefore reduces worker (and user) exposure\nto toxic substances.\n– Meeting community expectations – Considering Circular Design in\nthe Built Environment can lead to buildings that align with expectations\nto reduce waste, reduce technology and reduce climate impacts.\nRefurbishing or refitting existing buildings also preserves the history\nassociated with the building. In turn, buildings with stronger ESG\ncredentials attract higher rent and market value than other buildings29\n– Knowledge Sharing – Incorporating Circular Design can progress the\nintegration of circular principles in the Built Environment so that it\nbecomes a mainstream practice that others can benefits from.\nLooking ahead at the future for circularity in the Built Environment\nAs pressure on resources increases, the business case for Circular Design will likely strengthen over time.\nThe Built Environment sector, like others is encouraged to consider that those who innovate first, and adopt\nCircular Design approaches are likely to be placed at a competitive advantage as the transition to a circular\neconomy accelerates in coming decades.\nCommunity expectations are likely to increase over time. Established trends indicate that businesses\nwho do not have a well-defined ESG (environmental, social and governance) approach to their operations\nmay lose relevance. There is strong evidence that Circular Design practices can assist businesses in the\nBuilt Environment sector achieve higher ESG scores, primarily because of the improved environmental and\nsocial outcomes delivered through these projects.30 Higher ESG scores can have ‘positive brand and\nreputational effects’ that support business growth.\nResources are likely to get scarcer.
