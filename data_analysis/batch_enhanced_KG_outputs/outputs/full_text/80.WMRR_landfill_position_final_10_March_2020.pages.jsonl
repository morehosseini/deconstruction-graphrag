WMRR also supports\nAustralia’s efforts to build a circular economy.\nWMRR acknowledges that each aspect of the waste management hierarchy fulfills an important role in an\neffective best practice waste management and resource recovery system, and that each aspect plays a different\nand significant role due to regulatory, economic, and environmental factors across Australia.\nManaging waste in accord with this hierarchy including the disposal of residual waste1 to modern landfills, is an\nessential service. Even at the highest levels of resource recovery in a circular economy, there will be a continuing\nneed to dispose of some residual waste to landfill (considered as leakage under the circular economy model) to\nprotect human health and the environment.\nModern Australian landfills must be:\nEngineered facilities designed to comply with high environmental standards and tightly regulated by\nplanning and environmental regulators. A well‐engineered landfill provides containment (clay and\ngeosynthetic liners and covers) to minimise emissions of leachate, stormwater and landfill gas, and\ntreats leachate and landfill gas to protect human health and the environment.\nEffectively managed to efficiently utilise airspace, operated to provide containment of waste\nprogressively on a daily basis, and monitored to comply with regulatory requirements. Additionally,\nmany modern landfills apply the technology and systems to process landfill gas, which is 50% methane,\neither to renewable energy, providing a local renewable energy source, or oxidised to less potent\ncarbon dioxide by flaring or passively in bio‐covers, consequently reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nWMRR supports best practice landfills that are planned, sited, designed, constructed, and operated to the\nhighest environmental and regulatory standards, and supports innovation and technological advancement to\nfurther advance landfill design and management. WMRR also supports the considered use of landfill levies to\ndrive greater resource recovery.\nWMRR deems the role of landfills in modern waste management systems integral and considers that landfills\nprovide an essential service, playing a fundamental role in protecting human health and the environment, both:\n in managing residual waste flows within the economy; and\n during periods of service and economic disruption and post disaster emergency waste management.\n1 Residual waste generally refers to material that is left over after processing (through a processing facility and/or a source separation\nsystem) … The composition of residual waste streams may vary from region to region and over time, depending on the availability of\nrecycling and recovery options.
