Recycling construction and demolition waste allows\ncompanies to save costs by reusing materials instead of\npurchasing new ones. The savings on raw material procurement,\ndisposal fees, and landfill charges are significant, especially for\nlarge-scale construction projects. Furthermore, recycling can lead\nto job creation and stimulate local economies by fostering\nindustries focused on waste processing and material recovery.\nGovernments have recognized the economic benefits of recycling,\noffering incentives such as tax breaks, grants, and subsidies to\nbusinesses that invest in waste recovery technologies. With\npressure to reduce operational costs, construction companies\nincreasingly seek cost-effective, environmentally friendly solutions,\nwhich makes recycling an attractive option.
