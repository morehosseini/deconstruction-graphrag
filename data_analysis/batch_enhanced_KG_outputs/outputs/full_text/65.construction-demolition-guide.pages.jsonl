About this guide\nThis guide supports the civil construction, building and demolition industries to eliminate or reduce the\nrisk of harm to human health and the environment through good environmental practice.\nIt is especially relevant if your work involves activities that include:\n• land development\n• commercial and residential building\n• civil construction\n• subdivision\n• demolition\n• decommissioning\n• earthworks\n• maintenance, repair and renovation of existing structures\n• other construction trades.\nThis guide has been developed for people whose role involves site planning or environmental\nmanagement in supporting activities and projects of all scales and complexity.\nYou can use this guide to help inform the decisions and steps you can take to eliminate or reduce risk. It\ncontributes to your state of knowledge and is not a compliance document.\nEPA developed this guide in consultation with construction companies, industry groups, local councils\nand government agencies.\n1.1. Why is this guide important?\nAt the centre of the Environment Protection Act 2017 (EP Act) is the general environmental duty which\nrequires anyone engaging in an activity that may give rise to risks of harm to human health or the\nenvironment from pollution or waste, must minimise those risks so far as reasonably practicable (EPA\npublication 1856).\nThis general environmental duty applies to all Victorians. It means you will need to proactively assess\nand manage the risks of harm from your activities.\nEliminating or reducing risk is important because industry activities could impact, for example:\n• Air – affecting human health and wellbeing; ecosystems and biodiversity; local amenity and aesthetic\nenjoyment; visibility; climate systems.\n• Noise – affecting people’s sleep; communication, cognition and learning; domestic or recreational\nactivities; tranquillity and enjoyment inside and outside.\n• Land – affecting human health; buildings and structures; soil health and the integrity and biodiversity\nof ecosystems; production of food, flora and fibre; aesthetics.\n• Water and groundwater – affecting water-dependent ecosystems and species; drinking water,\nagriculture and aquaculture; water-based recreation; industrial and commercial use; Traditional\nOwner cultural values; buildings and structures.\nAssessing and controlling risk in a structured way will help you:\n• prevent harm to human health and the environment\n• comply with your legal obligations\n• meet community expectations.\nCivil construction, building and demolition guide\nPage 7", "text_len": 2553, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Understanding your duties\nIn this chapter we look at your duties under Victoria’s environment protection laws. It will help you\nunderstand your legal obligations and what is expected of you when managing environmental risk on\nyour site.\nVictoria’s environment protection laws mean that anyone engaging in an activity that poses risk of\nharm to human health and the environment, from pollution or waste, must eliminate or reduce that risk.\nThe general environmental duty applies to all Victorians.\nIt is your responsibility to understand and assess your risks. This includes understanding how your\nactivities can impact land, water and air quality, or cause harm from waste and excessive noise.\nYou also need to eliminate or reduce risk so far as reasonably practicable. You can do this by putting\nappropriate controls in place that are proportionate to the risk.\nYour approach to managing risk will depend on the complexity and scale of your activities or project, as\nwell as the nature of the risks you need to manage. We cover one approach to managing risk in Chapter\n3 Managing your environmental risk.\nEnvironment Protection Act 2017, sections 25–27\n2.1.

Who enforces environmental law?\nEPA authorised officers have powers of entry. Council officers can also be authorised officers under the\nEP Act. This allows them to inspect businesses and premises, provide advice and guidance about\ncompliance, and enforce environment protection laws.\nAuthorised officers who visit your business or site will consider issuing you with directions or remedial\nnotice if they believe you are not fulfilling one or more duties.

You must\nfollow these directions immediately.\n• Remedial notices – may be issued if an authorised officer reasonably believes you are not complying\nwith environment protection laws or where there is a harmful or unlawful situation.\nA remedial notice is a formal record of actions you need to take to comply with an obligation or\naddress a risk of harm. They include:\n– Improvement notice – requires you to take action to remedy non-compliance.\n– Prohibition notice – requires you to stop action that has an immediate risk of harm and remedy\nthe issue.\n– Notice to investigate – requires you to investigate potential contamination or harm.\n– Environmental action notice – requires you to take action to clean up contamination or industrial\nwaste.\n– Waste abatement notice – requires you to remove, dispose or restore a place affected by litter or\nwaste.\n• Site management orders – used for long-term management or rehabilitation of contaminated land or\nto undertake a broad range of actions to manage the risk of harm. You could be required under this\norder to, for example, install and maintain infrastructure, monitor contamination onsite and report on\nan ongoing basis.\nAuthorised officers will use this guide to support their assessments.

Managing your environmental risk\nIn this chapter we look at ways you can manage risk to help you meet your general environmental duty.\nThis includes some suggested steps to follow and some tools you can use to support the risk\nmanagement approach you decide to follow.\nA well thought out approach to managing risk can help you:\n• better identify, assess and control your risks\n• prevent harm to human health and the environment\n• comply with legal obligations\n• meet community expectations.\nPlanning and managing risk on your site is an ongoing responsibility. Thinking about potential hazards,\nrisks and controls that eliminate or reduce risk before you begin your project can help you put more\neffective controls in place. These may also be more cost effective for your business or project.\nFor example, good site planning may involve locating noisy works further away from nearby residences,\nor behind a noise barrier.\nWhen planning, you should also consider the timing of your activities over the lifecycle of your project –\nrisks may change as works onsite progress. Preparing project plans over the lifecycle of your project\nmay help you identify risks and constraints. These can influence the controls you implement to eliminate\nor reduce environmental risk.\nWe look at many of the things you should consider in planning your project in Chapters 4 to 8 of this\nguide.\nRisk management terms\n• Hazard – something that could go wrong and can cause harm. In this guide, harm\nrelates to pollution and waste, e.g., dust, noise, sediment.\n• Receptor – something of value which can be harmed by hazards, including\nhumans and the environment e.g., animals, vegetation and waterways. We use\n‘receptor’ and ‘receiver’ interchangeably in this guide.\n• Risk – the threat posed by a hazard to a receptor. Risk can be determined by\nunderstanding the likelihood and consequence of the harm.\n• Control – a measure that can eliminate or reduce the hazard or risk.\n3.1. Ways you can manage your risk\nFollowing steps in a structured way will help you better understand the hazards and risks from your\nactivities that could impact human health and the environment. It will also help you identify appropriate\ncontrols to put in place.\nAssessing and controlling risk: a guide for business (EPA publication 1695) and four short videos take you\nthrough four steps to manage risk (see Figure 3.1).

This can be\na helpful ranking tool to inform your processes and systems.\n3.1.3. Step three: implement controls\nThis step involves identifying the most appropriate controls to manage the risks\nyou assessed at step two. You may need to implement multiple controls to\nminimise the risk of harm that a single hazard presents.\nYou can use a hierarchy of controls to help select appropriate controls. Aim to\neliminate the hazard as the most preferred approach (see Figure 3.3).\nMost preferred\ne\nc\nn\ne\nr\ne\nf\ne\nr\nP\nLeast preferred\nFigure 3.3. Hierarchy for controlling hazard or risk.\nSee Assessing and controlling risk: a guide for business (EPA publication 1695) for more information\nabout the hierarchy of controls.\nStaff training\nStaff training and procedures can help prevent pollution occurring and enable staff to respond quickly\nto a pollution incident.\nIt is a legal requirement under the EP Act s.25(4)(e) to provide information, instruction, supervision and\ntraining to staff to minimise risk of harm to human health and the environment. Training can improve\nthe safety of your worksite and protect your business’ reputation.\nYou should also make others onsite aware (e.g., through an induction process) of the environmental site\nhazards and train them on the precautions they need to take. This includes contractors, maintenance\nworkers, administrative staff and visitors.\nCivil construction, building and demolition guide\nPage 18", "text_len": 1798, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Some verification examples include:\n• ensuring any standard operating procedures are up to date\n• signoff/approval by management of visual inspections undertaken, within a register\n• capturing and review of training requirements.\nWhat makes a control effective?\nPut simply, a control that is designed effectively + operating effectively = an effective control\nDesign effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which a control is designed to reduce the likelihood\nand/or the consequence of the hazard. The control should be designed to operate reliably and/or\nsufficiently frequently to reduce the hazard causing harm.\nOperating effectiveness is established when a control is checked and can be demonstrated to have\noperated as designed, without interruption or failure throughout the period it was relied upon to achieve\nits objective. Operating includes a requirement that ensures those operating the control are adequately\ninformed and trained.\nThe effectiveness of controls should be overseen by management and independently validated.\nSee Assessing and controlling risk: a guide for business (EPA publication 1695) and four\nshort videos for more information on the four-step risk management process.\nOther resources to help you develop a risk management approach include\nAustralian/New Zealand or International Standards, such as ISO 31000, Risk\nManagement. This addresses risk across all business activities.\n3.2. Optional tools to help you record the way you manage risk\nKeeping records is not a legal requirement for most businesses but may help with your business\nplanning. The records you keep can also demonstrate to EPA what steps you have taken to reduce or\neliminate the risk of harm if a pollution incident occurs.\n3.2.1. Risk register\nYou can use a risk register to record hazards, risks and controls. This may help ongoing management of\nyour risks and can be used to document actions taken to check controls and any amendments made.\nUpdate and add information to your register progressively.\nSignoff by senior management of the risk register, and any updates made, can demonstrate\nunderstanding of the risks across your business.\nIt could be more appropriate for your business to use another approach.

Activities that may\ncause noise and vibration include:\n• demolition work\n• site preparation works\n• site cleanup and dismantling activities\n• site works\n• truck and vehicle movement/operation.\n4.1.3. Why it’s important to manage noise and vibration\nComplaints about noise and vibration are some of the most common complaints that EPA, councils and\nbusinesses involved in civil construction, building and demolition receive.\nNoise and vibration can pose a risk of harm to human health and the environment if it is too loud,\ncontinues too long, recurs frequently, suddenly increases in level, or includes disturbing sounds such as:\n• impulses (banging, hammering)\n• tones (squealing, screeching, humming)\n• low frequency sound. This can be more intrusive than high frequency sound as it is less attenuated\nduring propagation and when transmitting into buildings. Noise abatement measures are less\neffective at low frequencies.\nAs well as causing annoyance and immediate disturbance to people and animals, environmental noise\nand vibration is now recognised as a public health issue. It can have serious or long-term health\nimpacts. These impacts may include:\n• inability to sleep or reduced quality of sleep\n• impaired communication\n• reduced cognitive performance (e.g., reduced attention span, memory and concentration in people\nworking and children studying)\n• exacerbation of mental health problems (e.g., stress, anxiety and depression)\n• changes to the natural behaviour of animals, which affects their ability to survive and reproduce (e.g.,\nreduced ability to hear alarm calls warning of predators)\n• discomfort caused by vibration.\nIn extreme cases, vibration may also result in damage to buildings and infrastructure.\nHealth and safety of workers\nSee WorkSafe Victoria for guidance on managing noise risk to the health and safety of\nworkers onsite.\nCivil construction, building and demolition guide\nPage 24\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  | Noise is unwanted sound or vibration which disrupts the acoustic environment and | \n |  |  |  | can impact health, sleep and daily living, learning, communication and relaxation. | \n |  |  |  | Noise is a form of pollution which risks harming human health and the environment. | \n |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  | Health and safety of workers | \n |  |  |  | See WorkSafe Victoria for guidance on managing noise risk to the health and safety of | \n |  |  |  | workers onsite. | \n |  |  |  |  | ", "text_len": 2857, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

When disturbed, the materials may release asbestos fibres\nwhich if breathed in can cause a range of health problems including asbestosis, lung cancer and\nmesothelioma.\nA ban on use of certain types of asbestos in Victoria was introduced in 1992, with a total ban introduced\nin 2003. Buildings constructed or refurbished in Australia prior to these bans may contain asbestos\nmaterials.\nFor more information, see WorkSafe Victoria’s Asbestos: A handbook for workplaces.\nPCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls)\nPCBs are a stable group of chemical substances that do not degrade easily and are resistant to\ntemperature changes, acids and alkalis.\nPCBs may be encountered in old electrical equipment including transformers, capacitators, fluorescent\nlight fittings, concrete caulking compounds, and a range of other products that take advantage of its\nchemical stability. Due to the serious health concerns associated with PCBs and their persistence in the\nenvironment, the importation and manufacture of PCBs in Australia has been banned since the 1960s.\nPCB exposure can lead to human health affects including cancer, liver damage, neurological and\nimmunological changes.\nLead\nLead is likely to be present in older structures, occurring in paint, old water pipes and other plumbing\nfittings, sheet lead, solders, lead flashing, lead light windows and glass. One of the major sources of lead\nin the environment are lead-based paints which are commonly used on window frames, doors, skirting\nboards, kitchen and bathroom cupboards, exterior walls, gutters and fascia and metal surfaces. Lead-\nbased paint in good condition is usually not a problem, except in places where painted surfaces are\nsubject to friction or impact such as windows and doors.\nCivil construction, building and demolition guide\nPage 98", "text_len": 2717, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

They typically occur\nin coastal areas, and inland waterways, wetlands and drainage channels which are waterlogged and\nhave saline and anaerobic properties, as well as in mine spoil. When exposed to air, acid and heavy\nmetals such as arsenic and aluminium can be mobilised and leach into the environment, contaminating\ngroundwater and surface waters, posing a risk of harm to human health and the environment, and\nengineering works. However, ASS can be generally considered safe and harmless when not disturbed.\nPFAS (Per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances)\nPFAS are a group of chemicals manufactured since the mid-20th century that have historically been\nused in firefighting foams and other industrial and consumer products including mist suppressants,\nnon-stick cookware and food packaging. There are many types of PFAS, including perfluorooctane\nsulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS). PFAS can build\nup in food chains and may pose a risk to human health and the environment.\nPFAS residues may be present in construction materials and therefore wastewater generated through\nconstruction and demolition also has the potential to contain PFAS. In addition, PFAS residues can be\npresent in soil, sediments, groundwater and landfill leachate due to historical industrial activities.\nWhile scientific research continues to be undertaken, EPA, consistent with federal guidelines from the\nEnvironmental Health Standing Committee (enHealth), takes a precautionary approach and advises\npeople to reduce their exposure to PFAS. EPA’s Interim position statement on PFAS\n(EPA publication 1669) reflects the most up-to-date information from the 2019 enHealth Guidance\nStatement and is supported by additional assessments by EPA.\nDuty holders should familiarise themselves with their overarching obligations under the EP Act and\nsupporting regulations, along with EPA Position Statements as issued from time to time.
