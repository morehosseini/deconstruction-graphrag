ERM Australia Consultants Pty Ltd (‘ERM’), performed independent assurance over selected performance data and\nstatements presented in Landcom’s Annual Report and Sustainability Report (‘the Report’) for the year ended 30 June 2024.\nCriteria\nWe have used the following criteria against which to evaluate the content of the Report:\n• The AA1000 AccountAbility Principles of Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Impact\n• The Global Reporting Initiative’s Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards)\n• The Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Recommendations\n• The Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Modern Slavery Act) Reporting Requirement\n• Landcom’s own reporting criteria(cid:1005)(cid:1005) as set out in the Report, and relevant policies and procedures to evaluate the selected\ndata.\nRespective responsibilities\nLandcom management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the information within the Report. Landcom\nmanagement is also responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation\nof the Report, so that it is free from material misstatement. Landcom management is also responsible for setting targets and for\nthe development of appropriate internal controls to monitor performance.\nERM’s responsibility, in accordance with Landcom management’s instructions, is to carry out a limited assurance engagement\nunder the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board’s Assurance Standard on Assurance Engagements ASAE 3000\nAssurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (‘ASAE 3000’) on selected performance\ndata and disclosures in the Report and a Type 2 ‘moderate level’ of assurance over the Report in accordance with AccountAbility’s\nAA1000AS Assurance Standard (‘AA1000 v3’).

The procedures we\nperformed were based on our professional judgement and included the steps outlined below:\n• Interviewed functional managers and performed a desktop review of Landcom’s policies, including the Strategic\nDirections, Sustainable Places Strategy, and other key internal documents, as well as web-based information, to\nunderstand Landcom’s material topics, how they are managed and what progress was made during the reporting period;\nand the processes in place for adherence to the AA1000AccountAbility Principles.\n• Reviewed the coverage of material topics within the Report against the key topics raised in media reports, peer reports,\nmanagement interviews and key internal documents\n• Interviewed data owners of selected data sets to understand how they collected, calculated and aggregated data from\nprojects as well as what assumptions or estimations were made.\n• Sought and reviewed supporting information or explanations for selected data, statements and

ERM Australia Consultants Pty Ltd (‘ERM’), performed independent assurance over selected performance data and\nstatements presented in Landcom’s Annual Report and Sustainability Report (‘the Report’)

Materiality, Responsiveness and Impact\n• The Global Reporting Initiative’s Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards)\n• The Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Recommendations\n• The Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Modern Slavery Act) Reporting Requirement\n• Landcom’s own reporting criteria(cid:1005)(cid:1005) as set out in the Report, and relevant policies and procedures to evaluate the selected\ndata.\nRespective responsibilities\nLandcom management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the information within the Report. Landcom\nmanagement is also responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation\nof the Report, so that it is free from material misstatement. Landcom management is also responsible for setting targets and for\nthe development of appropriate internal controls to monitor performance.\nERM’s responsibility, in accordance with Landcom management’s instructions, is to carry out a limited assurance engagement\nunder the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board’s Assurance Standard on Assurance Engagements ASAE 3000\nAssurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (‘ASAE 3000’) on selected performance\ndata and disclosures in the Report and a Type 2 ‘moderate level’ of assurance over the Report in accordance with AccountAbility’s\nAA1000AS Assurance StaCnlimdaartde (‘AA1000 v3’).

As understood through our transition risk planning, key climate-related transition risks to Landcom include\nstranded assets, increases in green premiums across construction materials and activities, increases to insurance\npremiums and affordability concerns related to mortgages for our residents.\nBetween FY21 and FY22, Landcom undertook a project to model the potential financial implications of selected\nclimate-related risks that were identified as being most likely to influence Landcom’s operations from a business,\nstrategy and/or financial perspective. As part of this project, Landcom reviewed the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change’s 6th Assessment Report and selected three scenarios, including a 2oC or lower scenario, to support\nour climate risk assessments.
