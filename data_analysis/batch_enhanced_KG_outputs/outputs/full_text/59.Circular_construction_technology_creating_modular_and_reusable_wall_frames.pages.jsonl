Using the power of automation, they take a frame design and convert it\ninto a kit-of-parts, with every component of the structure designed for disassembly and reassembly. This modular design\naligns to circular economy thinking by enabling XFrame’s customers to reuse the building parts and thus reduce\nconstruction waste from going to landfill.\n\nWe spoke with Carsten, Managing Director and co-founder of XFrame, on how their technology can help rethink the way we\nbuild office spaces.\n\nWHO\n\n“We are a circular construction technology. What we do is take a design and convert it to a kit-of-parts that can be\nmanufactured globally. The premise behind the design is that every element of that building structure is completely reusable\nand reconfigurable, driven by a proprietary automation platform.”\n\n“Every building component is designed as a series of independent, interchangeable layers which are easily disassembled\nand able to be reconfigured for a client's future project.”\n\f", "text_len": 1153, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "59.Circular construction technology creating modular and reusable wall frames.pdf", "page_num": 3, "text": "VISION\n\n“The whole vision for XFrame came about through Ged Finch, the other co-founder of the company and the inventor. He\ntalked about developing a wall-framing system that can be completely reused and the driving force behind that was to\nreduce the amount of construction waste going to landfill. So, we combined Ged’s invention and vision with my experience\nwithin the building industry and understanding of its inefficiencies to deliver a different product and way of building.”\n\n“The ability to create a completely customizable, modular building solution is unique. We can take any design and convert it\ninto XFrame without compromising the design intent or the design outcome of that particular build. You've then also got the\nability to completely repurpose and reconfigure those building components, which | think is a key point of difference.”\n\n“With every building project, there are components that break or cannot be reused. The unique thing with XFrame is each\nindividual component can be remanufactured. So, if one component breaks, it doesn't necessarily mean that the entire wall\nsection can't be reused. We just remanufacture or replace the bits that are broken - minimising what would otherwise go to\nlandfill.”\n\n“ The ability to create a completely customizable, modular building solution is\nunique. We can take any design and convert it into XFrame without compromising\nthe design intent or the design outcome of that particular build. You've then also\ngot the ability to completely repurpose and reconfigure those building\ncomponents, which | think is a key point of difference.”\n\nHOW\n\n“At the start, there was a lot of work around engineering. We had to understand what the system was capable of, and how it\nwould work with existing building code requirements. We tested, pulled and pushed it until it broke to understand what the\nlimitations were. From there, we were able to determine where XFrame would fit best within the building industry. We also\nbuilt out the automation capabilities that sat in the background, which are the real secret sauce in terms of utilising the\npower of automation to take a design and turn it into a kit-of-parts, all based on a key set of structural engineering rules.”\n\n“The automation technology takes a design, goes through and calculates the components required to deliver that particular\nproject and nests them on cut sheets, which is what we send to the fabricator — and it does that in the most efficient\nmanner possible. We're then typically left with five per cent waste at manufacturing. The automation then goes further to\nautomatically produce assembly instructions, installation guides, construction documentation, carbon reports and pricing\ndocumentation, which is al! built into the workflow. In this way, we can take a design and be manufacturing ready with all\nsupporting documentation within the space of a couple of days. Automation is about 95 per cent of the process - the\nremaining five per cent is human involvement including interpreting plans, optimising design outcomes and building\nefficiencies.”\n\n“Our team now has automation specialists, architects, project delivery people and the corporate side of the business.”\n\n“Initially, we needed the capital to get up and running, develop the proof of concept and deliver some projects. We don't\nmanufacture in-house, so we didn't need to go and invest in a whole heap of machinery and instead partnered with\ncompanies already doing that. The main way in which we overcame the barrier of market acceptance was really through just\ndelivering projects.”\n\f", "text_len": 3581, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

We've now delivered more than 50 projects across three continents, showing that there’s an appetite out there.\nOur project types too have moved from smaller fit outs to entire floors of buildings. The scope of our involvement in\nprojects is also growing and | think that has only transpired in the last 18 months.”\n\n“One client in New Zealand took their fit out with them when they moved their warehouse and rebuilt it themselves in their\nnew location. They were a couple of panels short, based on the new configuration, so all we did was cut some more panels\nfor them, put them in the mail and sent them across and they finished it off themselves, making it zero-waste, because\nevery component was reused.”\n\n\"XFrame has also provided ANZ branches with a unique solution to fulfil its vision of modular, reconfigurable and adaptable\nretail offering. We deliver modular meeting rooms and bunkers for them within their retail stores. These rooms are\ncompletely relocatable and reconfigurable providing ANZ with ultimate flexibility and without massively interrupting\noperations and creating waste.”\n\n“Our business model is very much around a distributed manufacturing model. We don't have manufacturing, assembly or\ninstallation capabilities in house. This makes us very easily scalable. So, we're now actively pursuing overseas markets\nwhere we can bolt onto existing operations and provide a whole new product range for them.”\n\f", "text_len": 1774, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
