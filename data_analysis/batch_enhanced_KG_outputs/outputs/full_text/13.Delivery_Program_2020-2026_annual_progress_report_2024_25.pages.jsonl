Unwearable textiles were introduced to these events in February and already 6 tonnes have | \n | been recycled. At the last two Recycle It Saturday events we also piloted the addition of a furniture reuse stream, | \n | partnering with four local charities. Furniture dropped off was rehomed to families in need or resold in charity stores. | \n | Approximately 153 items of furniture were accepted from 100 residents. These included chairs, ottomans, bedside | \n | tables and bookshelves. The pilot will be evaluated in 2025/26. | \n |  | \n | The City hosted its annual Household Chemical Clean Out event on 19 October 2024. The event is run by the EPA | \n | and is also open to non-City of Sydney residents. It attracted a total of 662 people, an increase of 11% in attendance | \n | from the previous year. The event collected 24.12 tonnes, an average of 36kgs per vehicle. The most popular items | \n | were paint and hydrocarbons. | \n |  | \n | The Ultimo recycling pop-up received 4,129 drop offs and recycled 25.5 tonnes of materials this year. Of these, 1,154 | \n | residents used the pop-up for the first time in 2024/25 and the most popular items dropped-off for recycling were | \n | electronics, batteries, small metals, blister packs and polystyrene. | \n |  | \n | Two additional recycling stations were installed at Victoria Park Pool and Pyrmont Community Centre this year, | \n | bringing the total to 20 recycling stations across 18 locations in the City of Sydney. This means 85% of residents live | \n | within a 10 minute walk to a recycling station. The stations were updated to improve their accessibility with braille and | \n | tactile lettering for people with low or no vision, and blister packs were added as a new recycling stream from June | \n | 2025. The stations recycled 3 tonnes of materials this year. This includes 1,475kgs batteries, 208kgs mobile phones, | \n | 280kgs light bulbs, 892kgs of small electronics, 175kgs of vapes and 1kg of blister packs. | \n |  | \n | The City collected 35.4 tonnes of tricky items (including clothes, electronics and polystyrene) from 2,867 pickups | \n | directly from residents’ homes through the doorstep recycling service over the year. There are two Reverse Vending | \n | Machines (RVMs) in the City of Sydney that collect beverage containers through the Return and Earn scheme. Over | \n | this financial year Kings Cross collected 1,737,538 containers with a weight of 123 tonnes and Sydney Park collected | \n | 3,725,311 containers with a weight of 197 tonnes. This was a combined collection of 5,462,869 containers and 321 | \n | tonnes in the City of Sydney. | ", "text_len": 9813, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Transport for NSW is responsible for approving these |  | \n | changes. With funding and approval by TfNSW, all local and regional roads in the City of Sydney local area now have |  | \n | a speed limit of 40km/h. The City will continue to advocate for a 40km/h limit on the state road network within the City |  | \n | of Sydney local area. Additionally, the City has applied to Transport for NSW for a 30km/h speed limit in the existing |  | \n | city centre 40km/h High Pedestrian Activity Area, in line with Action 15 in the City's Access Strategy and Action Plan. |  | \n |  |  | \n | In March 2025, the City made a high level submission to NSW Government’s review of the Roads Act 1993 (stage |  | \n | one). Through this, we advocated for: |  | \n | • providing Councils with responsibility to manage the reduction of speed limits on our local roads (as long as the |  | \n | process set by TfNSW is reasonable and not excessively resource intensive) |  | \n | • providing Councils with responsibility to set 10km/hr speed limits on local roads associated with shared zone |  | \n | proposals |  | ", "text_len": 6693, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
