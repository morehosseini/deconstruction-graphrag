There is\nroughly 6,500 tonnes of glass available in the waste stream for processing into glass fines.\nRepair / Dismantle – a system where unwanted household durables are either repaired for resale or redistribution,\nor dismantled into their component parts. This process is highly labour intensive, but also adds significant\ncommunity benefit in the form of entry level jobs and high quality recovered products.\nFor the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that household durables that are unable to be repaired and resold are\ndismantled. In some cases, this results in 100 per cent resource recovery. In other cases, the recovery rates are lower.\nA key product from this diversion option is the recovered metals that are sold into global markets, and the net\nbenefits are social engagement and significant savings of landfill airspace from around 2,000 tonnes of recycled\nwaste. The ACT already supports initiatives such as Soft Landing Mattress Recycling.\nRecycling wood chip – which involves the shredding of waste timber and screening the shredded product to\nproduce different sized products for different markets. The shredding occurs in a two stage process: a low speed"}
