Design for Disassembly\n\n \n\nDescription\n\nThis strategy aims at enabling the disassembly potential at end of\nservice life. The useful life of some components in buildings outlast\ntheir service life as part of a system. It is important to design upfront for\nthe practical disassembly of components in order to recover residual\nvalue at end of their service life. According to ISO 20887, seven design\nprinciples for disassembly should be considered: ease of access,\nindependence, avoidance of unnecessary treatments and finishes,\nsupporting re-use business models, simplicity, standardisation and\nsafety of disassembly. Appropriate for all sites and typologies.\n\nKey Performance Indicator\n\nDisassembly and recovery potential:\n\nEase of Recovery + Ease of Reuse and Recycling Scoring, defined as\nper EU Level(s) Indicator 2.4 Design for Deconstruction\n\n(Assessment methodology based on DGNB TEC1.6 Ease of recovery &\nrecycling)\n\nBenefits\n\n- Reduce embodied carbon emissions in the long term\n- Reduce material extraction in the long term\n\n- Enable future reuse of building components\n\n- Retain each asset's value at end of service life\n\nChallenges\n\n- May result in requiring higher material quantities for the first use, but\nbeneficial over total life cycle"}
