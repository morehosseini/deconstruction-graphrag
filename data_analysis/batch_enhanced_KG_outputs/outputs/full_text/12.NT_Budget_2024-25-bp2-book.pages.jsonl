It also meets the requirements of the Fiscal Integrity and\nTransparency Act 2001 (FITA) and the Uniform Presentation Framework (UPF) as agreed by all\nAustralian jurisdictions.\nFiscal outlook\nThe 2024-25 Budget reflects the Territory Government’s significant operating and capital investment,\ncombined with the effects of market factors and natural disasters reducing the Territory’s own-source\nrevenues, partially offset by improved GST revenue.\nThe 2024-25 Budget includes $2.2 billion in new policy commitments over the budget cycle to\n2026-27 to support health services, education, employment and training, public order and safety,\ncost of living and creating work opportunities through investment in infrastructure.\nThe softening of key commodity prices, impact of global and domestic inflationary pressures on\nthe operating costs of Territory mines, the announced closure of a mine operator and suspension\nof another mine operation due to the effects of Cyclone Megan have resulted in a net reduction to\nthe Territory’s mining royalties forecast over the budget cycle.\nGST revenue, the Territory’s largest revenue source, is expected to improve by $750 million over\nthe budget cycle to 2026-27 when compared with the 2023-24 Budget. This is primarily due to an\nincrease in the national GST collections pool, attributable to the flow-on effects of higher inflation\nand stronger taxable consumption, as well as an increase in the Territory’s GST relativity from\n4.98725 in 2023-24 to 5.06681 in 2024-25.\nThe fiscal balance is expected to remain in deficit over the budget cycle, with a return to surplus\nnow anticipated in 2029-30, one year later than the A plan for budget repair 2028-29 target. The\ncumulative effect of the revised fiscal balance forecasts has also resulted in higher net debt and net\ndebt to revenue ratios across the budget cycle.\nKey fiscal projections in the 2024-25 Budget include:\n• general government net operating balance deficit of $410 million in 2024-25, and surpluses\nevery year over the forward estimates\n• total revenue for the non financial public sector of $8.76 billion and total expenditure (including\nnet capital investment) of $11.12 billion in 2024-25\n• non financial public sector fiscal balance deficit of $1.59 billion in 2024-25, improving each\nsubsequent year to a deficit of $176 million in 2027-28\n• net debt for the non financial public sector of $11.05 billion in 2024-25, with a net debt to\nrevenue ratio of 126%.\nIn accordance with section 9(1)(c) of the FITA, the government must specify the key fiscal indicators\nit considers important and against which fiscal policy will be assessed. The government’s key fiscal\nindicators are the general government sector’s net operating balance, and the non financial public\nsector’s fiscal balance, net debt and the net debt to revenue ratio.\nTable 1.1 provides the projections for these indicators for the 2024-25 Budget.\nExecutive summary | 5", "text_len": 3120, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Assessment of expected outcomes for fiscal strategy objectives and targets is\nprovided in Chapter 4 Fiscal strategy statement.\nEconomic outlook\nThe Territory’s economy is supported by a pipeline of public sector investment projects, which will\nalso facilitate further private sector investment in the medium term. There are large-scale private\nsector investment projects underway in the resource sector in 2023-24, led by the Barossa project\nand related investment at the Darwin liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant. Elevated levels of activity\nduring the construction phase of the Barossa project will support economic growth in 2023-24\nand 2024-25, with exports of the first LNG shipments expected from September 2025 when the\nproject becomes operational.\nGross state product (GSP) is forecast to grow by 2.3% in 2024-25, before accelerating to 7.1% in\n2025-26 as LNG exports from the Barossa project come online. State final demand (SFD), which\nexcludes trade, is forecast to grow by 1.9% in 2024-25 before contracting by 0.2% in 2025-26, as\nprivate investment eases following completion of Barossa construction and Darwin LNG plant life\nextension works.\nHousehold consumption growth is expected to improve over the forecast period following a\ncontraction in 2023-24, as real wages improve, tax cuts flow into household balance sheets from\n1 July 2024 and interest rates are expected to fall. Public consumption is expected to provide\ncontinued strength from 2024-25 across the forward estimates. This reflects Commonwealth and\nTerritory announcements on additional funding to meet the Schooling Resourcing Standard and for\nremote housing.\nEmployment is forecast to increase by 1.5% in 2023-24 and moderate to 0.9% in 2025-26, reflecting\nthe Territory’s investment growth profile, then stabilise at 1.3% per annum in line with population and\nlabour force growth and ongoing solid demand for skilled labour in the Territory. Population growth of\naround 0.8% is estimated for 2023-24, increasing to an average of 1.1% per annum over the forward\nestimates period.\nWages growth is expected to moderate to 3.2% in 2024-25 and average 3.1% across the forward\nestimates period. This is consistent with inflation returning to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA)\ntarget band from late 2025, and is in line with easing labour shortages reported in the Territory and\nnationally.\n6 | Executive summary", "text_len": 2970, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The economic contributions arising from these projects\nare not included in the economic forecasts. Any projects that do reach final investment decision\nand commence during the forward estimates period will have a positive impact on the Territory’s\nmacroeconomic forecasts.\nThe forecast profile for economic growth is reviewed and updated each year to reflect\ncontemporary economic and fiscal outcomes, and developments. Discussion explaining material\ndifferences between the updated key economic indicators in the 2024-25 Budget and those\nprojected at the time of the 2023-24 Budget is provided in Chapter 3 Economic outlook.\nCommonwealth revenue outlook\nCommonwealth revenue, at around 72% of total Territory revenue at the non financial public\nsector in 2024-25, is a significant component of the Territory budget. Table 1.3 sets out expected\nCommonwealth revenue to the Territory over the budget cycle from 2023-24 to 2027-28.\nTotal Commonwealth revenue is expected to be $6.28 billion in 2024-25, comprising $4.21 billion\nin untied revenue from GST receipts, and tied revenue of $2.08 billion from agreements with the\nCommonwealth to deliver specific purposes. This is expected to grow by 2.7% to $6.45 billion\nby 2027-28.\nGST revenue is expected to be $3.99 billion in 2023-24, growing by 4.9% per annum to\n$4.83 billion by 2027-28. Compared with the 2023-24 Budget, GST revenue is expected to be\n$750 million higher over the budget cycle to 2026-27. This is primarily due to an increase in the\nnational GST collections pool, as well as an increase in the Territory’s GST relativity from 4.98725\nin 2023-24 to 5.06681 in 2024-25. These increases are partly offset by relatively higher estimates\nof interstate population growth reducing the Territory’s GST share.\nExecutive summary | 7", "text_len": 2967, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Compared with the 2023-24 Budget, tied revenue is expected\nto be $1.32 billion higher over the budget cycle to 2026-27, mostly reflecting additional funding\nfor remote housing and school-related agreements.\nTable 1.3: Commonwealth revenue\n2023-24 2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28\nRevised Budget Forward estimate\n$M $M $M $M $M\nUntied Commonwealth revenue 3 989 4 208 4 356 4 589 4 830\nTied Commonwealth revenue 1 802 2 076 1 853 1 697 1 620\nTotal Commonwealth revenue 5 791 6 284 6 209 6 286 6 450\nFurther details on the Territory’s GST estimates, tied payments and material variations since the\n2023-24 Budget are discussed in Chapter 5 Commonwealth revenue.\nTerritory taxes and royalties outlook\nTaxation and royalty revenue represents the Territory’s largest own-source revenue stream,\nconstituting 38% of the Territory’s own-source revenue or 11% of total revenue at the\nnon financial public sector, and provides the Territory with the fiscal autonomy to support delivery\nof infrastructure and services. Table 1.4 provides the projections for Territory taxes and royalty\ncomponents for the 2024-25 Budget. Revenue from taxes and royalties is expected to remain\nstable over 2023-24 and 2024-25 with an average total of $911 million per annum, and average\n$1 billion per annum over the forward estimates period.\nTaxation revenue for 2023-24 is expected to total $694 million and rise steadily over the budget\nand forward estimates period, underpinned by stable growth across most tax categories in line\nwith broader economic activity. When compared with the 2023-24 Budget, taxation revenue is\nexpected to be around $16 million per annum higher over the budget cycle to 2026-27 due to\nstronger than expected receipts for payroll taxes and taxes on insurance and motor vehicles. This\ngrowth is partly offset by downward revisions to conveyance duty following greater than expected\ndeclines in property transaction volumes and prices in the Territory.\nMining and petroleum royalties are expected to total $209 million in 2023-24, increase marginally to\n$218 million in 2024-25, before increasing over the forward estimates. Since the 2023-24 Budget,\nroyalties have been revised downwards in 2023-24 and 2024-25, and to a lesser extent across\nthe forward estimates due to softening of key commodity prices, impact of global and domestic\ninflationary pressures on operating costs of Territory mines, announced closure of a mine operator\nand suspension of another mine operation due to the impact of Cyclone Megan.\nConsistent with economic forecasts in the budget, revenue estimates from new onshore gas\ndevelopments are not included in the royalty outlook. In addition, new mine developments are not\nfactored into forecasts until a final investment decision has been announced. As a result, any mines\ncommencing from 1 July 2024 under the new ad valorem royalty scheme will be factored into\nestimates once final investment decision is announced. Existing mines will be grandfathered under\nthe current profit-based royalty scheme.\n8 | Executive summary", "text_len": 3293, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Net debt\nfor the non financial public sector is estimated at $11.05 billion in 2024-25, with the net debt to\nrevenue ratio forecast at 126%.\nTotal revenue in the non financial public sector is estimated to be $8.76 billion in 2024-25,\nincreasing to $9.26 billion in 2027-28, with a total expenditure (including net capital investment)\nestimate of $11.12 billion in 2024-25, moderating to $10.25 billion by 2027-28.

Similar to\nthe approach with major projects, tied funding is generally not included in the estimates unless a\nfunding agreement has been signed with the Commonwealth. Tied funding agreements generally\ndo not affect the Territory’s fiscal balance as the revenues are matched with corresponding\nexpenditure.\nAs shown in Table 2.6, current grant revenue in 2023-24 and 2024-25 is expected to be elevated,\naveraging $1.46 billion per annum, before reducing and remaining largely constant over the\nforward estimates, averaging $1.22 billion per annum. The higher revenue in earlier years is due\nto the conclusion of the National Partnership on Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment\n(NTRAI) in 2024-25, and step down in funding for homelands housing and infrastructure upgrades,\nwhich peaks in 2024-25.\nWhen compared with the 2023-24 Budget, Table 2.8 shows current grants revenue is forecast\nto increase over the budget cycle to 2026-27 by a total of $975 million, largely due to new\nCommonwealth funding of $163 million under the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement;\n$144 million for remote housing repairs and maintenance under the new landmark 10-year joint\ncommitment by the Commonwealth and the Territory; $120 million for homelands housing and\ninfrastructure upgrades; $90 million through the ‘A Better, Safer Future for Central Australia’\ninvestment package; $93 million for a one-year extension of the NTRAI in 2024-25; and\n$56 million under the National Skills Agreement, combined with the reclassification of $79 million\nrelating to Commonwealth funding under the Pharmaceutical Reform Agenda, previously\nrecognised as sales of goods and services revenue.\n20 | Fiscal outlook", "text_len": 3214, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Revenue\nfor capital projects is recognised when spent and not when the cash is received in accordance\nwith accounting standards, therefore annual fluctuations reflect the timing of delivery of capital\nprojects including $189 million under the National Water Grid Fund, expected to be delivered over\n2024-25 to 2026-27, combined with higher funding for Land Transport Infrastructure projects over\n2024-25 and 2025-26.\nAs shown in Table 2.8, estimated capital grants revenue is expected to be $121 million lower in\n2023-24 than forecast in the 2023-24 Budget due to the revised timing of Commonwealth-funded\nroad projects and the National Water Grid from 2023-24 into the forward estimate years in line\nwith expected delivery. From 2024-25 and over the forward estimates, capital grants revenue\nis expected to be a total of $520 million greater when compared with the 2023-24 Budget.\nThis increase is mainly attributable to revised timing of projects from 2023-24, combined with new\nCommonwealth funding of $367 million for remote housing under the 10-year joint commitment\nby the Commonwealth and the Territory, increased roads funding of $66 million and funding for\nsocial housing of $50 million.\nSales of goods and services\nSales of goods and services includes fees and charges, rent and tenancy income collected by\nvarious government agencies, and represents around 15% of total revenue over the budget cycle.\nThe most significant component relates to gas sales, and electricity, water and sewerage charges\ncollected by government owned corporations.\nAs shown in Table 2.6, sales of goods and services revenue is expected to increase from\n$1.13 billion in 2023-24 to $1.47 billion by 2027-28. Sales of goods and services are expected\nto grow by an average 6.9% per annum over the budget and forward estimates, largely driven by\nan expected increase in the rate of return for electricity network, higher water consumption and\nexpected increase in gas volumes from 2024-25 in the Power and Water Corporation.\nWhen compared with the 2023-24 Budget, Table 2.8 shows expected reductions over 2023-24\nand 2024-25 in sales of goods and services revenue, mainly due to lower forecast gas sales in\nthe Power and Water Corporation. From 2025-26, increases predominantly reflect additional\nrevenue under the public housing remote rent framework, expected to be higher in each year\nacross the budget cycle, partially offset by the reclassification of Commonwealth funding under the\nPharmaceutical Reform Agenda to current grants revenue across all years.\nInterest income\nInterest income includes returns on short-term and fixed-interest investments combined with\nrealised gains on Conditions of Service Reserve investments, and represents around 1.5% of total\nestimated revenue over the budget cycle. Table 2.6 shows interest income is expected to remain\nrelatively stable, averaging $134 million per annum. As shown in Table 2.8, interest income is\nprojected to increase by $20 million in 2023-24 and then by an average $6 million per annum from\n2024-25 when compared with the 2023-24 Budget, mainly due to higher than expected returns\non investments.\nDividend and income tax equivalent income\nDividend and income tax equivalent income recognised in the non financial public sector comprises\nestimated payments by NTTC, and is expected to remain largely stable at an average $53 million\nper annum.

In 2023-24, other revenue is projected to be $124 million,\na $41 million increase when compared with the 2023-24 Budget, predominantly due to\ninsurance reimbursements relating to the Darwin Correctional Facility, and a GST refund from the\nAustralian Taxation Office following a favourable tax ruling on the provision of disability housing.\nFrom 2024-25, other revenue is expected to remain relatively stable at an average $95 million\nper annum over the budget cycle.\nExpenditure changes since 2023-24 Budget\nTable 2.9 sets out the Territory’s expenditure projections in the non financial public sector for the\n2023-24 revised estimate, 2024-25 Budget and forward estimates.\nTable 2.9: Non financial public sector – expenditure components\n2023-24 2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28\nRevised Budget Forward estimate\n$M $M $M $M $M\nExpenses\nEmployee expenses 3 122 3 103 3 017 3 101 3 205\nSuperannuation expenses 520 528 528 532 520\nDepreciation and amortisation 854 855 860 856 855\nOther operating expenses 2 546 2 501 2 359 2 386 2 434\nInterest expenses 482 586 663 716 756\nCurrent grants 1 182 1 213 1 143 1 149 1 179\nCapital grants 165 193 108 92 33\nSubsidies and personal benefit payments 74 68 67 68 69\nTotal expenses 8 945 9 047 8 745 8 900 9 051\nNet capital investment 1 537 2 070 1 617 1 399 1 198\nTotal expenditure 10 482 11 117 10 362 10 299 10 249\nAs shown in Table 2.9, total expenditure is projected to peak in 2024-25 at $11.12 billion, and\nthen average $10.3 billion per annum over the forward estimates period.\nTable 2.10 compares the revised expenditure projections for the 2024-25 Budget with those\npublished in the 2023-24 Budget and 2023-24 Mid-Year Report.\n22 | Fiscal outlook", "text_len": 2774, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Parameter factors are reviewed each budget, taking into\nconsideration the latest policy and economic developments, for the purpose of providing agencies\nwith additional financial capacity to deliver services at current pricing levels, offset by measures\ndesigned to improve efficiency in government. The main parameters used to adjust forward\nestimates are:\n• wages – inflator\n• consumer price index (CPI) – inflator\n• efficiency dividend – deflator.\nAs part of the 2024-25 Budget, the medium-term wages indexation parameter that applies beyond\nthe Northern Territory Public Sector (NTPS) 2021–2024 Wages Policy from 2025-26 and for\nthe remainder of the 10-year fiscal projection period, was changed from 2% to 3% ongoing. The\nimpact of this policy change on the budget is $30 million compounding per annum from 2025-26.\nThere was no change to the wages inflator for 2023-24 and 2024-25, remaining at 0%, however\nagencies received additional lump sum funding in the 2023-24 Budget for these two years to\nreflect the change in the Wages Policy to 2%.\nThe CPI parameter for the budget year is generally adjusted to match the year-on-year change in\nthe Darwin CPI for the latest December quarter to better reflect actual price trends. The CPI factor\nfor 2024-25 has been increased from 3.3% to 3.9% to align with the December 2023 quarter\nannual Darwin CPI growth. CPI parameters for the forward estimates were adjusted to 2.8% in\n2025-26, 2.5% in 2026-27, 2.4% in 2027-28, and 2.5% per annum thereafter.\nAn additional growth parameter of 1.4% applied to all hospital-related expenditure in recognition of\ngrowth in demand for health services, remains unchanged from the 2023-24 Budget.\nFiscal outlook | 23", "text_len": 2870, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

An efficiency\ndividend of 1% per annum has been applied in all years and remains unchanged from the\n2023-24 Budget.\nFor the following agencies and functions, a two-thirds discount is applied to the efficiency dividend\nto recognise that a majority of their costs relate to frontline services, which are substantially fixed\nin nature:\n• Department of Education\n• Northern Territory Police\n• Northern Territory Fire and Emergency Service\n• correctional services function of the Department of the Attorney-General and Justice\n• children and families and youth justice functions of the Department of Territory Families, Housing\nand Communities\n• hospital services function of the Department of Health.\nFor Territory-funded operating grants and subsidies budgets, a composite indexation factor is\napplied based on 75% of the wages factor and 25% of the CPI factor, less the applicable efficiency\ndividend for that year.\nGovernment owned corporation forward estimates are based on forecasts provided by the\ncorporations during the development of their SCIs. The forecasts reflect future expectations in\nrevenue, contracted and regulated costs, capital investments, operational efficiencies and other\nfactors agreed by a corporation’s shareholding minister and the board.\nEmployee and related expenses\nTable 2.9 shows estimated employee and related expenses, including superannuation, continue\nto account for about 41% of total expenses and represent the Territory’s largest expenditure.\nEmployee expenses are expected to remain largely constant over 2023-24 and 2024-25 at an\naverage of $3.64 billion per annum, declining to $3.55 billion in 2025-26 before resuming average\nannual growth of around 2.5% from 2026-27. The decline in 2025-26 reflects the step down and\ncessation of time-limited funding to support hospital demand pressures over 2023-24 and 2024-25,\ncombined with the cessation of Commonwealth funding agreements from 2025-26, partially offset\nby increased costs associated with the change in the wages indexation factor from 2% to 3%.

These expenses will vary over the budget cycle as new\nassets are purchased or constructed and assets reach the end of their useful life or are revalued in\nline with accounting standards.

Over the forward estimates, current\ngrants are projected to remain constant at around $1.16 billion per annum, and primarily comprise\nTerritory and Commonwealth-funded grants to schools, non-government health service providers,\ncultural and sporting organisations, local government councils, and delivery of children and family\nprograms by non-government organisations.\nCapital grants\nCapital grants comprise payments to recipients, such as local government councils and\nnon-government organisations, for the purpose of acquiring or constructing new physical assets or\nupgrading existing physical assets. As highlighted in Table 2.9, capital grant expenses are projected\nto peak in 2024-25 at $193 million, in line with the payment profile of Commonwealth-funded\nhousing homelands and infrastructure upgrade grants, before declining each year to $33 million by\n2027-28. The reduction in capital grants across the forward estimates reflects the conclusion of\nCommonwealth funding agreements for homelands and social housing accelerator payment.\nSubsidies and personal benefit payments\nSubsidies and personal benefits are payments aimed at reducing all or part of the costs of an\nactivity and include debts owing to the Territory that are waived or extinguished. Subsidies and\npersonal benefit payment estimates are highest in 2023-24 at $74 million, mainly due to one-off\nsupport for the Tiwi Plantation Corporation.

Monetary policy set by the RBA also influences\nhousehold consumption, business confidence and investment decisions in the Territory.\nNationally, the RBA forecasts weak economic growth in the near term as inflation and\nmonetary policy weigh on demand. While business investment is also expected to ease, the\nlevel of investment is expected to remain relatively high by historical standards, supported by\nthe large pipeline of existing construction projects.

Conversely, operating deficits indicate revenues are insufficient\nto fund current operations. While in the short term cyclical operating deficits may be appropriate\nduring periods of economic downturn, persistent or structural operating deficits subsequently pass\ndebt relating to current services to future generations. Operating deficits also provide no capacity\nfor investment in infrastructure beyond depreciation levels, without further borrowings.\nWhile there is no explicit time period in the definition of a generation, the Territory’s fiscal strategy\nadopts a medium-term target of 10 years to achieve an operating surplus and reduce debt to\nensure current services are met by the current generation. Consequently, the overarching principle\nwithin each fiscal strategy objective is to achieve fiscal balance surpluses to reduce debt within\n10 years.\nOngoing objective and target: Territory-funded expense growth to be lower than total\nown-source and untied revenue growth in the general government sector over the budget\ncycle from the budget year\nThis objective targets Territory-controllable expenditure growth. It excludes time-limited external\nfunding that can distort growth rates over the forward estimates and tends not to affect the\nfiscal outcome as increases in revenue are generally matched by a corresponding increase in\nexpenditure. Lower growth in Territory-funded expenses than growth in total Territory own-source\nand untied revenues indicates the budget is on a path to achieving a general government operating\nbalance surplus.\nAs shown in Table 4.1, Territory-funded expenses, excluding depreciation, are projected to increase\nby 1% in aggregate over the budget and forward estimates compared to anticipated growth in\nown-source and untied revenue of 13.1% over the same period. As a result, this fiscal strategy\nobjective and target is projected to be achieved over the budget cycle.\nThe marginal growth in Territory-funded expenses over the budget cycle is largely driven by\ntime-limited government operational commitments over 2024-25 and 2025-26, including for\nhospital and correctional services, youth justice, urban housing, tourism activities, and domestic,\nfamily and sexual violence prevention. Projected growth in own-source and untied revenue of\n13.1% reflects improvements in GST revenue over the budget cycle, combined with notably lower\nmining royalties in 2024-25 following the suspension of mining operations due to the effects of\nCyclone Megan.\nTable 4.1: General government sector – Territory-funded expense growth, and own-source and untied\nrevenue growth\n2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28\nTarget\nBudget Forward estimate Growth on track\n$M $M $M $M %\nTerritory-funded expenses1 6 142 6 019 6 090 6 203 1.0 yes\nOwn-source and untied revenue 5 870 6 074 6 340 6 636 13.1\n1 Excludes depreciation and unspent funds carried over from prior years.\n36 | Fiscal strategy statement", "text_len": 3417, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Accordingly, maintaining a financially sustainable public service\nis critical in containing expenditure growth. However, as the Territory Government is a major\ncontributor to the Territory economy and the single largest employer in the Territory, this fiscal\nstrategy objective takes a balanced approach premised on ensuring outlays for service provision\ndo not outpace population growth.\nThe target requires general government sector Territory-funded employee expense growth not\nto exceed the wages policy parameter, net of efficiency dividends, plus the Territory’s long-term\nannual population growth in any year over the budget and forward estimates.\nSince the 2023-24 Budget, the wages factor influencing the target for Territory-funded employee\nexpense growth has been revised. As discussed earlier in Chapter 2 Fiscal outlook, the wages\nindexation parameter was changed from 2% to 3% ongoing from 2025-26, while the Territory’s\nlong-term annual population growth and efficiency dividend remain unchanged at 1.1% and 1%,\nrespectively.\nFrontline expenditure equates to around 65% of total Territory-funded expenditure and receives a\ntwo-thirds discount on the efficiency dividend, resulting in a net efficiency dividend of 0.6% for the\npurposes of this assessment. Accordingly, the wages policy parameter assessed in 2024-25 is 2.5%,\nreflecting the 2% wages policy, less a net efficiency dividend of 0.6%, plus 1.1% long-term annual\npopulation growth. From 2025-26, the wages policy parameter reflects the increase to the wage\nindexation parameter.\nTable 4.2 highlights that estimated Territory-funded employee expense growth is well below the\nsum of the wages policy parameter (net of efficiency dividends) and the Territory’s 1.1% long-term\nannual population growth. It also demonstrates that government is budgeting to limit growth in the\ngeneral government sector’s single largest expenditure item.\nThe projected decline in Territory-funded employee expense growth in 2024-25 largely reflects\nthe step down in time-limited funding to support hospital demand pressures over 2023-24 and\n2024-25. The growth profile in Territory-funded employee expenses from 2025-26 reflects\nyear-on-year funding increases to support police resourcing and government schools combined\nwith increased funding for the change in the wages indexation factor from 2% to 3%.\nTable 4.2: General government sector – Territory-funded employee expense growth\n2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28\nBudget Forward estimate\n% % % %\nTerritory-funded employee expense growth - 0.4 1.5 2.8 2.2\nWages policy parameter1 plus long-term annual 2.52 3.5 3.5 3.5\npopulation growth\nTarget on track yes yes yes yes\n1 Net of efficiency dividends.\n2.

This stability provides consistent revenue\nstreams to fund service delivery in contrast to more volatile GST revenue outcomes in recent years.\nFurthermore, taxing policies can significantly influence private business investment and\nemployment decisions. Consequently, competitive taxing policies play a critical role in pursuing\nthe FITA principle of maintaining employment, economic development and growing the\nTerritory economy.\nOngoing objective: Maintain a competitive tax environment that encourages investment,\ncreates jobs and attracts business to the Territory, while raising sufficient revenue to contribute\nto funding government’s service delivery requirements\nTarget: Territory taxation effort for the last assessed year by the Commonwealth Grants\nCommission at least 90% of the state average of 100%\nThis fiscal strategy objective aims to maintain taxation at levels competitive with other jurisdictions\nto encourage increased levels of business activity in the Territory while also ensuring sufficient\nlevels of own-source revenue are generated to contribute to funding government’s service delivery.\nRelative tax competitiveness is complex to assess due to the inherent differences in respective\neconomies and taxation regimes across jurisdictions. A nationally recognised measure of the\ncompetitiveness of each jurisdiction’s tax system is taxation effort, as assessed by the CGC.\nThis measure is a lagging indicator as the CGC updates the information annually based on the\nactual outcome of the previous year.\nTaxation effort assesses the extent to which a jurisdiction’s actual revenue collections are above\nor below its assessed capacity to raise revenue if it imposed national average tax settings. A ratio\nabove 100 indicates a state is collecting more revenue than it would if it applied state average\npolicy settings, whereas a ratio below 100 indicates it collects less revenue than it would if it\napplied state average policies. The fiscal strategy aims to achieve an assessed taxation effort of at\nleast 90% to maximise revenue generation while remaining competitive with other states.\nTable 4.6 shows the Territory is the lowest taxing jurisdiction with an assessed taxation effort of\n82% for 2022-23, the latest year assessed by the CGC. Accordingly, this fiscal strategy target\nhas not been achieved as the Territory’s taxation effort is below the target of 90%. The Territory\ngenerally demonstrates below-average taxation effort as it does not impose land tax and levies\nlower than average motor vehicle taxes.\nTable 4.6: Taxation effort by jurisdiction, 2022-23\nNSW Vic Qld WA SA Tas ACT NT Average Target met\n% % % % % % % % %\nTotal taxation effort 97.1 108.0 95.1 98.6 96.0 84.2 135.3 82.0 100 no\nSource: CGC 2024 Update\nThe Territory’s taxation effort decreased from 86.2% in 2021-22 to 82% in 2022-23 largely due\nto lower stamp duty on conveyances and fewer large one-off commercial transactions in 2022-23\ncompared with 2021-22.\n40 | Fiscal strategy statement", "text_len": 3301, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Accordingly, the fiscal strategy aims for the Territory Revenue Office’s operating\nexpenditure to be less than 1% of total taxes and royalties collected.\nTable 4.7 demonstrates this element of the fiscal strategy is expected to be achieved with the\nTerritory Revenue Office’s operating expenditure projected to be below the 1% target across the\nbudget and forward estimates. The higher ratio in 2024-25 reflects elevated operating expenditure\nassociated with developing a new revenue management ICT system, combined with a reduction\nin mining royalties in 2024-25 following the suspension of mining operations due to effects of\nCyclone Megan.\nTable 4.7: Territory Revenue Office expenditure to taxation revenue raised\n2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28\nBudget Forward estimate\nTerritory Revenue Office expenditure ($M) 8 5 5 5\nTerritory taxes and royalties ($M) 919 982 993 1 048\nExpenditure to revenue (%) 0.8 0.5 0.5 0.5\nTarget on track yes yes yes yes\nPrinciple 4: Prudent management of debt and liabilities\nThe fiscal strategy principle of prudent management of debt and liabilities directly satisfies the\nFITA principles of managing financial risks faced by the Territory (having regard to economic\ncircumstances), including maintaining Territory debt at prudent levels and ensuring funding for\nservices is provided by the current generation.\nDuring periods of low economic growth and constrained revenues, it may be prudent to raise\nhigher levels of debt to maintain government expenditure and support services to the economy.\nWhen there is strong revenue growth and private sector investment, lower borrowings are justified\nas they present an opportunity to reduce debt. Consequently, prudent debt management is difficult\nto explicitly define and requires borrowings to be assessed in the context of prevailing economic\nand fiscal conditions.\nOngoing objective: Maintain or improve the Territory’s credit rating\nTarget: Territory’s credit rating of Aa2 (negative) or better\nExcessive debt can restrict government’s capacity to maintain appropriate service levels through\nincreased borrowing costs and impact investor confidence resulting in negative effects on the\nTerritory economy.\nMoody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) assigns long-term issuer and debt ratings to the NTTC,\nthe entity that issues debt on behalf of the Territory and its government owned corporations.\nNTTC’s debt is guaranteed by the Territory and the rating reflects the Territory’s credit quality.\nFiscal strategy statement | 41", "text_len": 2923, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Higher ratings indicate a strong fiscal and economic\nposition, and result in the ability to borrow at lower interest rates. Lower ratings indicate credit\nchallenges, such as revenue or policy weaknesses and increasing debt levels, and result in higher\ninterest rates on borrowings to compensate investors for elevated credit risk. Negative outlooks\nreflect a potential downgrade within the next six months to two years.\nThe Territory’s credit rating was last assessed by Moody’s on the 2023-24 Budget in July 2023,\nresulting in an unchanged credit rating for the Territory at Aa3 with a stable outlook. Accordingly,\nthis fiscal strategy target has not yet been met.\nLong-term objective and target: The Territory’s non financial public sector net debt to revenue\nratio at or below 50%\nThe net debt to revenue ratio is a recognised measure of a jurisdiction’s ability to repay borrowings,\nwith a higher ratio indicating a lower ability to repay debt and a lower ratio indicating a stronger\nability to repay debt. The net debt to revenue ratio is calculated as gross debt liabilities less\nselect liquid financial assets as a proportion of total revenue for the non financial public sector.\nHistorically, the Territory maintained a long-term average net debt to revenue ratio of 40%. Due to\nthe implementation of revised accounting standards on leases in 2019-20, this long-term average\nhas been adjusted to 50% and retained as a long-term objective of the fiscal strategy.\nAs shown in Table 4.8, the non financial public sector’s net debt to revenue ratio is projected to be\n126% in 2024-25, increasing to 133% by 2027-28. It is anticipated the net debt to revenue ratio\nwill remain above 100% over the medium term, and therefore this fiscal strategy objective and\ntarget is not likely to be met.\nTable 4.8: Non financial public sector – net debt to revenue ratios\n2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28\nTarget on\nBudget Forward estimate track\n% % % %\n2024-25 Budget 126 132 135 133 no\nThe FITA incorporates a cap on assessable debt at the non financial public sector of $15 billion\n(the debt ceiling). The legislated debt ceiling increases accountability for financial performance and\nsupports improving the Territory’s credit rating and net debt to revenue ratio.\nAssessable debt is defined as total borrowings less lease liabilities. Lease liabilities are excluded\nfrom the debt ceiling as their valuation is subject to changes in discount rates and does not\ncorrelate with actual cash proceeds sought from financial markets to fund the operating and capital\nactivities of government.\nNet debt is a fiscal measure determined by the ABS and accounting standards, and can be\ninfluenced by valuations of leases and returns on investments. Targeting borrowings is an indirect\nmeans of controlling net debt, as government can directly control and influence its level of\nborrowings, exclusive of leases. Total borrowings will always be greater than reported net debt as\nborrowings represent gross debt liabilities, while net debt comprises gross debt liabilities less select\nliquid financial assets.\nTable 4.9 presents the assessable debt for the 2024-25 Budget in accordance with the FITA debt\nceiling and shows that total borrowings, excluding leases, are projected to increase over the budget\ncycle but remain below the $15 billion cap in all years.\n42 | Fiscal strategy statement", "text_len": 3532, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

It satisfies the FITA principles of ensuring\nfunding for services is provided by the current generation and prudent debt management, and\nassists in the overarching principle that government owned corporations as commercial entities\nshould be self-supporting and largely autonomous.\nAs detailed earlier in Chapter 2 Fiscal outlook, given the concurrent development of the Territory\nbudget and statements of corporate intent (SCI), the fiscal strategy targets reported in final SCIs\nmay differ from those reported in this chapter.\nOngoing objective and target: Ensure government owned corporation operating expenditure\ngrowth does not increase at a rate greater than operating revenue growth\nSimilar to the general government sector’s fiscal strategy principle of sustainable service provision,\nthis fiscal strategy objective aims to improve profitability and restrain expenditure growth\nspecifically in government trading entities.\nTable 4.10 shows all three government owned corporations are expected to meet this element\nof the fiscal strategy. Power and Water Corporation’s high growth rate for revenue is driven by\nan expected increase in the rate of return for electricity network, higher water consumption\nand expected increase in gas volumes from 2024-25.

The GST\ncollections pool is expected to grow by 3.8% in 2024-25, reflecting updated nominal consumption\nand private dwelling investment outlooks, as well as a $250 million scheduled increase in\nCommonwealth GST pool boost payments. Factors impacting revised GST collections pool\nforecasts are set out below.\nThe national GST collections pool is mostly driven by national consumption and private dwelling\ninvestment. As GST is imposed on the nominal price of goods and services, collections are\ndependent on both the underlying level of consumption and investment (real consumption and\nreal private dwelling investment), as well as the price of goods and services (inflation). GST is also\nimpacted by the proportion of consumption related to non-taxable goods and services such as\nfresh food, rent, and health and education services.\nAs shown in Table 5.5. when compared with the 2023-24 Budget, GST collections pool forecasts\nhave been revised upward across all years. This is partly driven by higher prices on goods and\nservices in the first half of 2023-24 due to inflation persisting for longer than expected, combined\nwith a greater share of consumption on goods and services that attract GST such as restaurants,\nhotels, travel and new motor vehicles. GST collections pool forecasts were also affected by the\nsignificant increase in national population due to migration, particularly international students\nin 2023.\nAlthough headline inflation rates have moderated in 2023-24 and are expected to continue to\nease in 2024-25, higher prices, construction costs and population growth have increased GST\ncollections pool forecasts over the forward estimates. These factors are expected to be partly\noffset by slightly lower real consumption growth as the impacts of past interest rate rises flow\nthrough the economy and households resume saving following recent savings drawdowns and\ndebt increases.\nGST relativity\nThe GST relativity is a key parameter used to determine a state’s GST revenue. The relativity\ndetermines whether a state will receive more or less than its population share of the GST\ncollections pool.\nGST relativities are determined annually by the Commonwealth Treasurer based on CGC\nrecommendations. The CGC calculates relativities based on data over a three-year rolling period\nto derive a distribution of GST revenue that allows all states to provide services and infrastructure\nto a similar standard across the nation, having regard to differences in each jurisdiction’s\nrevenue-raising capacities, cost of service delivery and underlying service delivery needs.\nThe CGC’s assessed revenue-raising capacity and assessed expenditure needs for the Territory\ndiffer from actual revenue or expenditure incurred by the Territory. The CGC does not make\nrecommendations on how states should allocate budgets, nor does the CGC take into account all\nfactors affecting the cost of delivering services in each state or territory.\nIn March 2024, the CGC released its 2024 Update, which recommended increasing the Territory’s\nGST relativity to 5.06681 in 2024-25, from 4.98725 in 2023-24. Chart 5.3 sets out the Territory’s\nrelativity over time and illustrates its greater volatility compared with other states.\nCommonwealth revenue | 51", "text_len": 3452, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The\nGST relativity forecast for the forward estimates is based on a three-year average relativity held\nconstant over the forecast period, adjusted for GST distribution reforms.\nThe 2024-25 GST relativity recognises that the Territory is assessed as having the lowest fiscal\ncapacity of the states, reflecting:\n• above-average assessed expenditure needs due to a relatively high share of disadvantaged\npopulation groups, including people living in remote and very remote areas, diseconomies of\nscale in administration and above-average infrastructure requirements, primarily for roads (higher\nGST relativity)\n• below-average assessed capacity to raise own-source revenue across most revenue lines,\nparticularly property taxes (higher GST relativity)\n• above-average assessed investment requirements and construction costs (higher GST relativity)\n• above-average share of relevant Commonwealth payments (lower GST relativity).\nThe main contributors to the increase in the Territory’s GST relativity in the 2024 Update as\nassessed by the CGC were:\n• large increases in coal prices and royalties, which decreased other states’ GST requirements\n• increased Territory wage costs relative to other states\n• updated socioeconomic data following the 2021 Census showing greater Territory disadvantage\nand a more dispersed population, which particularly increased the Territory’s assessed health and\nhousing needs.\nThese factors were partly offset by national schools and health spending growing faster for\nnon-Indigenous populations, and slower growth in administrative scale costs impacting small\njurisdictions. Changes to capital investment also had a downward impact on the Territory’s relativity\ndue to greater urban transport, and slower health and rural roads expenditure growth.\n52 | Commonwealth revenue", "text_len": 2221, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "12.NT Budget 2024-25-bp2-book.pdf", "page_num": 55, "text": "Budget Strategy and Outlook\nThe 2024-25 GST relativity also includes the Commonwealth’s GST distribution reforms, which\nhave the effect of reducing the Territory’s relativity from 5.14575 to 5.06681. The reforms are being\nimplemented over six years from 2021-22 to 2026-27, with 2024-25 being the first year in which\na minimum relativity of 0.75 applies. The impact of these reforms is temporarily offset through a\nCommonwealth funding ‘no-worse-off’ guarantee, which was extended to the end of 2029-30.\nGST relativity calculation methods are reviewed by the CGC every five years, with the next review\nto be finalised in early 2025. This will alter the calculation of relativities from 2025-26.\nPopulation share\nA jurisdiction’s share of the national population affects its share of GST revenue. Shares are\ninfluenced by the level of population growth in each state and territory relative to national\npopulation growth.\nThe Territory’s share of the national population is forecast to decline over the budget and forward\nestimates from 0.94% in 2023-24 to 0.93% in 2027-28. The Territory’s forecasts are marginally\nbelow the Commonwealth’s 2023-24 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook forecasts. The forecast\ndecline is largely due to increased population growth in other states as a result of higher overseas\nmigration intakes. Territory population growth may be stronger than forecast if new major\nprojects reach final investment decision.\nThe Territory uses its own estimates of Territory population growth, given its local knowledge\nregarding major projects and other events that may affect migration levels. Estimates of other\nstates’ populations are based on Commonwealth population projections prepared by the Centre\nfor Population. Chapter 4 of the Northern Territory Economy publication provides more detail on the\nTerritory’s population characteristics and forecast growth patterns.\nPayment timing\nAnnual GST payments to the states are made in line with Commonwealth budget forecasts. As\nthe Commonwealth budget is prepared prior to final GST entitlements being determined, the\namount paid by the Commonwealth as a GST advance may be more or less than a state’s actual\nentitlement, which is determined in the Commonwealth’s Final Budget Outcome. Any differences\nbetween the Commonwealth’s GST advances and the Final Budget Outcome entitlement are\nreconciled through a balancing adjustment in the subsequent year’s GST payments to the states\nand territories.\nThe Territory adopts the most recent Commonwealth forecast of GST advances plus the Final\nBudget Outcome balancing adjustment when forecasting current-year GST revenue as this reflects\nthe most likely payment outcome. Over time, balancing adjustments do not impact total Territory\nGST revenue, but rather change the period in which the revenue is received.\nThe Territory’s 2023-24 balancing adjustment is a $50 million reduction, reflecting the difference\nbetween Commonwealth GST advances and the Territory’s actual GST entitlement for 2022-23.\nThis was $115.5 million higher than forecast in the Territory’s 2023-24 Budget, partly due to the\nCommonwealth revising the 2022-23 GST collections pool forecasts down in its 2023-24 May\nBudget to be closer to final entitlements, reducing the size of the balancing adjustment.\nFor 2024-25, the estimated balancing adjustment is a $3 million reduction relating to GST revenue\nadvances in 2023-24. This reflects the difference in the Territory’s GST revenue forecast compared\nto the most recent Commonwealth forecast of Territory revenue. The divergence is due to differing\npool and population assumptions.\nCommonwealth revenue | 53", "text_len": 3643, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The GST distribution\nreforms, which have introduced a relativity floor, alter this fundamental principle with the effect\nthat most states would be funded to a lower standard of services and infrastructure without the\nCommonwealth’s no-worse-off guarantee payments.\nThe GST distribution reforms are being transitioned in stages, from 2021-22 to 2026-27, and\ncomprise four elements:\n• staged implementation from 2021-22 to 2026-27 of a new equalisation standard, being the\nstronger of New South Wales or Victoria\n• a minimum GST relativity floor of 0.7 from 2022-23, increasing to 0.75 from 2024-25\n• Commonwealth-funded top-ups to the GST pool of $600 million from 2021-22, increasing by\n$250 million from 2024-25, and indexed in line with GST pool growth\n• a temporary no-worse-off guarantee to the end of 2029-30.\nThe impact of these reforms has increased Western Australia’s GST share, which is the only\njurisdiction with a relativity below the minimum floor due to its significantly greater ability to raise\nown-source revenue from mining. As the amount distributed to Western Australia by this reform\nis more than the amount of GST pool top-up payments, all other jurisdictions are worse off and\nrequire the Commonwealth to make no-worse-off guarantee payments. Due to the no-worse-off\nguarantee, the reforms currently do not have a net impact on Territory GST revenue.\nThe Commonwealth’s 2023-24 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook estimates total national\nno-worse-off guarantee payments of $19.4 billion over 2023-24 to 2026-27. The Territory is\nexpected to receive $132 million in no-worse-off guarantee payments over 2023-24 to 2027-28,\nbased on relativity, pool and population forecasts.\nThe GST distribution reforms are scheduled to be reviewed by the Productivity Commission in 2026.\nTied Commonwealth revenue\nThe majority of tied Commonwealth funding to the Territory is provided under the\nIntergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations (IGA FFR) through national federation\nfunding agreements and Federation Funding Agreement (FFA) schedules. Tied funding is also\nprovided outside the IGA FFR through Commonwealth own-purpose expense (COPE) funding\narrangements.\n54 | Commonwealth revenue", "text_len": 2856, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

In accordance with section 10(1)(d), this chapter also\ncontains an overview of the Territory’s forecast tax expenditure as a result of concessions and\nexemptions for 2023-24 through to 2027-28.\nThe Territory’s own-source revenue includes taxes, mining and petroleum royalties, fees and\ncharges, rent and tenancy income, interest and dividend revenue, and profit and loss on the\ndisposal of assets. Own-source revenue provides the Territory with a degree of fiscal autonomy\nto support the delivery of infrastructure and services. As taxation and royalty revenue represents\nthe Territory’s largest own-source revenue stream, constituting 38% of the Territory’s own-source\nrevenue or 11% of total revenue expected in the non financial public sector in 2024-25, this\nchapter focuses on own-source revenue from taxes and royalties.\nWhile the Territory’s sources of revenue are broadly comparable with other states, with the\nexception of land tax which the Territory does not levy, the Territory is more reliant on revenue\nfrom the Commonwealth compared with other states, with own-source revenue comprising 28% of\ntotal revenue expected in 2024-25 in the non financial public sector, compared with an average of\n59% in other jurisdictions. This is due to the Territory’s relatively low own-source revenue capacity,\nreflecting a population of just over 250,000 and a narrower industry base than other states.\nAnalysis of Territory taxes and royalties\nIn 2024-25, revenue from taxes and royalties is expected to total $919 million and mainly\ncomprises taxes on employers (payroll tax) at 31%, mining and petroleum royalties at 24%, and\ntaxes on property (conveyance duty) at 14%.

Taxation revenue for 2023-24 is expected to total $694 million and\nrise steadily over the budget and forward estimates period, underpinned by stable growth across\nmost tax categories in line with the broader Territory economy.\nOn average, total taxation revenue between 2023-24 and 2026-27 is forecast to be around\n$16 million per annum higher than estimated in the 2023-24 Budget due to stronger than\nexpected receipts for payroll tax, taxes on insurance and motor vehicle taxes. This growth is partly\noffset by downward revisions to conveyance duty following the greater than expected impact of\ninterest rate rises on property transaction volumes and prices in the Territory.\nTaxes on employers\nPayroll tax\nPayroll tax is payable in the Territory when the total annual Australian wages of an employer\n(or group of employers) exceeds $1.5 million. Payroll tax is imposed at a rate of 5.5% on taxable\nTerritory wages less an annual deduction of up to $1.5 million.\nThe amount of the deduction is based on a sliding scale starting at $1.5 million and reducing by\n$1 for every $4 in wages paid by an employer over $1.5 million. This means an employer paying\nwages of $4.5 million receives a deduction of $0.75 million, whereas an employer paying wages of\n$7.5 million or more receives no deduction and payroll tax is calculated on the total taxable wages\npaid by that employer.\nTable 6.1 shows payroll tax revenue in 2023-24 is expected to total $292 million, declining slightly\nto $284 million by 2025-26, largely due to the Barossa offshore LNG facility transitioning from\nconstruction to operational activity, before rising steadily over the remaining forward estimates\nperiod. As presented in Table 6.3, when compared to the 2023-24 Budget, payroll tax is likely to\nbe $30 million higher in 2023–24 and is expected to be on average $8 million per annum higher\nover the forward estimates. These variations are mainly attributable to increased employment and\nstrength in wages growth.\nTaxes on property\nConveyance duty\nConveyance and related duty is derived from direct and indirect conveyances of dutiable property\nin the Territory. Dutiable property consists of land and chattels acquired with land.\nThe imposition of conveyance and related duty in the Territory differs depending on the dutiable\nvalue of the property. There are four tax brackets for conveyance and related duty. For property in\nthe lowest tax bracket (dutiable value not exceeding $525,000), a formula-derived rate is applied.\nOtherwise, a fixed rate applies determined by the value of the item being conveyed, as outlined in\nTable 6.4.\nTerritory taxes and royalties | 61", "text_len": 2808, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

A comparison of the Territory’s stamp duty regime with other states is provided later\nin this chapter.\nTable 6.1 shows the Territory is expected to collect $115 million in conveyance and related duty\nin 2023-24, increasing to $125 million by 2024-25 and resume trend growth from 2026-27\nas property market conditions are expected to normalise. Large commercial transactions are a\nsignificant source of variability to this profile, varying greatly in scale and being sporadic in nature.\nConveyance and related duty is expected to be $40 million lower in 2023-24 compared with\nthe 2023-24 Budget, as presented in Table 6.3. The variation in forecast collections mainly\nreflects the impact of interest rate rises on the cost of borrowing, which has reduced the volume\nof transactions, particularly for commercial transactions. As the RBA’s monetary policy settings\nbecome less restrictive, the volume of transactions and revenue is expected to recover over the\nforward estimates period.\nTaxes on the provision of goods and services\nTaxes on gambling\nGambling taxes in the Territory comprise community gaming machine tax, bookmaker tax,\nlotteries tax, the community benefit levy, casino/internet tax, betting exchange tax and\nwagering tax. Gambling tax revenue is a consistent and relatively stable contributor to Territory\nown-source revenue.\nAs shown in Table 6.1, gambling tax is forecast to total $110 million in 2023-24, reflecting\nhigher than expected community gaming machine tax revenue, offset by lower than expected\nrevenue from lotteries tax. While households face cost of living pressures, gambling, unlike other\ndiscretionary spending, tends to be relatively resilient with growth over the forward estimates\nperiod projected to be broadly in line with historical rates.\nTable 6.3 shows taxes on gambling are largely unchanged from forecasts published in the\n2023-24 Budget.\nTable 6.5 highlights estimated revenue from each of the Territory’s gambling taxes.\n62 | Territory taxes and royalties", "text_len": 2378, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Growth projections over the budget and forward estimates period\nreflect CPI-based indexation on the statutory tax cap.\nLotteries tax revenue is expected to total $19.9 million in 2023-24, about $4.1 million lower\nthan estimated in the 2023-24 Budget, and is largely due to a change in the business model of\none operator.\nThe community benefit levy fluctuates according to community gaming machine tax receipts.\nThe levy is expected to total $15.4 million in 2023-24, or $2 million higher than forecast in the\n2023-24 Budget, mainly due to higher than expected community gaming tax receipts. Levy receipts\nare expected to grow over the forward estimates period in line with growth forecasts for\ncommunity gaming machine tax receipts.\nCasino/internet tax revenue is expected to total $5.6 million in 2023-24, around $0.9 million\nhigher than forecast in the 2023-24 Budget, reflecting higher than anticipated gaming machine\nprofits in casino venues. Receipts are forecast to total $5.6 million in 2024-25 and increase\nmodestly by 1.3% per annum over the forward estimates period.\nBetting exchange tax revenue is expected to total $1.4 million in 2023-24, with forecasts over the\nforward estimates remaining consistent with the 2023-24 Budget.\nWagering tax revenue is expected to total $74,000 in 2023-24 and across the budget and forward\nestimates, about $0.2 million less than forecast in the 2023-24 Budget. This decrease reflects a\nshift in gambling practices and behaviours as bets are increasingly placed online and betting venues\nsuch as TABs close.\nTaxes on insurance\nInsurance duty is imposed on general insurance policies. Stamp duty on general insurance is\ncalculated at a rate of 10% of the premium paid on all general insurance products relating to\nproperty or risk in the Territory. Where the policy also relates to a risk or property outside the\nTerritory, the premium is apportioned.\nTerritory taxes and royalties | 63", "text_len": 3062, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

When compared to 2023-24 Budget forecasts, Table 6.3 shows\ninsurance duty forecasts have increased across all years by around $15 million per annum.\nTaxes on use of goods and performance of activities\nMotor vehicle taxes\nMotor vehicle taxes comprise stamp duty on initial registration and transfer of motor vehicles,\nmotor vehicle registration fees and a passenger service levy.\nTable 6.1 shows motor vehicle taxes are expected to be $100 million in 2023-24, decline slightly\nin 2024-25, before increasing modestly over the forward estimates period. When compared with\nthe 2023-24 Budget, motor vehicles taxes are projected to increase by $13 million in 2023-24\nand increase on average $9 million per annum over the forward estimates, as demonstrated in\nTable 6.3.\nGenerally, stamp duty is levied on the purchase price of a vehicle at a rate of $3 per $100 or\npart thereof. In 2023-24, revenue from this source is estimated to total $33 million, an increase\nof $11.9 million compared with 2023-24 Budget forecasts. Receipts in 2024-25 are expected\nto moderate to $25.2 million and increase at a long-term trend rate of 2.1% per annum over the\nforward estimates period.\nMotor vehicle registrations comprise heavy vehicle and light vehicle registrations. Heavy vehicle\nregistration fees are determined by the National Transport and Infrastructure Council. Light\nvehicle registration fees are determined by each state. In the Territory, light vehicle registration\nfees are calculated by reference to a differential rate scale based on the engine capacity of the\nvehicle. Fees are expressed in revenue units, with the monetary value of a revenue unit indexed on\n1 July each year in accordance with the Revenue Units Act 2009.\nIn 2023-24, the Territory is forecast to receive $64.9 million in motor vehicle fees, $1.3 million\nabove the 2023-24 Budget forecast. Revenue is expected to increase to $69.8 million in 2024-25\nand grow by an average of 3.6% per annum over the forward estimates period, in line with revenue\nunit indexation and vehicle registration growth consistent with the economic outlook.\nA passenger services levy of $1 is imposed on every trip taken in a taxi, minibus, private hire car\nor rideshare vehicle. Revenue from the passenger services levy remains unchanged from the\n2023-24 Budget, and is estimated at $2 million in 2023-24 and ongoing.\nMining and petroleum revenue\nThe Territory levies royalties on the extraction of mineral commodities from mining activities\nand onshore petroleum production. Mining and petroleum royalties are a charge for resource\nextraction, payable to the Territory as the owner of the resources.\nRoyalties are levied in the Territory on gold, silver, bauxite, iron ore, manganese, lead, zinc, lithium,\nilmenite, magnetite, oil and gas. Royalties have also been imposed in the past on commodities\nsuch as copper, limestone, vermiculite and mineral sands, and the Territory is highly prospective for\nseveral other minerals, including phosphate and rare earths.\nThe Territory currently imposes a royalty based on 20% of the net value or profit from mining\nactivities after deductions for allowable costs. A minimum royalty rate of 1% to 2.5% applies to\nthe gross production value of commodities extracted where the operator would otherwise pay less\nthan that amount under the net value calculation.\n64 | Territory taxes and royalties", "text_len": 3707, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

As most petroleum is not sold at\nthe wellhead, the value is calculated by recognising certain post-wellhead costs incurred in\ntransforming the raw product to its first saleable point.\nMining and petroleum royalty projections use a range of information from mining companies and\npetroleum producers, including estimates of commodity price movements, production levels and\nthe value of the Australian dollar, as well as the Department of Treasury and Finance’s internal\ncommodity price and market outlook.\nAs presented in Table 6.1, mining and petroleum royalties are expected to total $209 million in\n2023-24, increasing marginally to $218 million in 2024-25, and average $274 million per annum\nover the forward estimates period.\nThe estimate for mining and petroleum royalties in 2023-24 was revised down in the 2023-24\nMid-Year Report due to softening of key commodity prices, combined with the impact of global and\ndomestic inflationary pressures on the operating costs of Territory mines. Following this downward\nrevision, a Territory mine operator announced its closure to the Australian Securities Exchange in\nJanuary 2024 and in March 2024, Cyclone Megan significantly impacted infrastructure on Groote\nEylandt, leading to the suspension of mining activities. Flooding and evacuation of Borroloola,\nassociated with the cyclone, also temporarily impacted mining activities. Under the profit-based\nmineral royalty regime, infrastructure repairs and replacement are claimable costs and will reduce\nmining royalty income to the Territory. These events have resulted in downward revisions to\n2023-24 royalty revenue since the 2023-24 Budget of $191 million as highlighted in Table 6.3.\nIn 2024-25, mining and petroleum royalties are estimated to decrease by $98 million compared to\nthe 2023-24 Budget forecast. This largely reflects the continuation of suspended mining operations\nas a result of Cyclone Megan, slightly offset by an expectation of stronger prices for other\ncommodities. From 2025-26, royalties are expected to remain largely stable and fluctuate in line\nwith mine life projections and the ongoing impact of inflation and Cyclone Megan on the operating\ncosts of Territory mines. Positive growth in royalties in 2027-28 is expected due to anticipated\nfavourable commodity prices.\nMineral Royalties Act 2024\nThe Mineral Development Taskforce Final Report released in April 2023 recommended that\ngovernment reform the Territory’s mineral royalty arrangements by introducing an ad valorem\nroyalty scheme. The Department of Treasury and Finance conducted several rounds of consultation\nwith stakeholders and procured independent economic and financial modelling to design an\neffective royalty scheme that meets the recommendation of the taskforce. The legislation for\na new Mineral Royalties Act 2024, if passed into law in the May 2024 Legislative Assembly\nsittings, will commence on 1 July 2024 and will apply to all mines that commence from that date.\nThe current profit-based royalty scheme under the Mineral Royalty Act 1982 will continue to apply\nto mines that were active in 2023 and prior years. This policy change has had no impact on the\nbudget or forward estimates.\nTerritory taxes and royalties | 65", "text_len": 3599, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

New mining operations will only be included in the royalty\noutlooks once final investment decision has been achieved.\nInterstate tax comparison\nThe composition of the Territory’s taxes is broadly similar to other jurisdictions, with the main\ndifference being the rates, exemptions and thresholds set by each state. The Territory is also the\nonly jurisdiction that does not have a land tax. The ability of states to determine their own tax\npolicy promotes competition between jurisdictions, and provides autonomy in calibrating tax\nsystems to achieve a jurisdiction’s specific fiscal, economic and social aims.\nThere are various approaches to measuring tax competitiveness. Two common approaches are\nCGC measures of taxation effort and capacity, and the representative taxpayer model.\nCommonwealth Grants Commission\nRevenue effort\nThe CGC assesses each state’s revenue-raising effort on an annual basis. Revenue effort is the ratio\nof the actual amount of revenue a state raises compared to the amount of tax revenue the CGC\nassesses could be raised if the state applied national average tax rates to its tax base.\nAverage revenue effort is assessed as 100%. A state with an above-average revenue effort will\nscore more than 100%, while a below-average effort scores less than 100%.\nTable 6.6 provides a comparison of the CGC’s assessment of taxation and own-source\nrevenue-raising effort in 2022-23 (the most recent year for which an assessment is available).\nTotal own-source revenue effort includes taxation and mining revenue, contributions by trading\nenterprises (government owned corporations) and user charges for some government services,\nincluding waste management levies, road charges and registry services.\n66 | Territory taxes and royalties", "text_len": 2879, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The Territory generally demonstrates below-average taxation effort as it does not\nimpose land tax and levies lower than average motor vehicle taxes. However, total own-source\nrevenue effort is above the national average and second only to the Australian Capital Territory,\nmostly due to the Territory’s mineral royalty arrangements.\nThe 2022-23 outcomes are lower than the results reported for 2021-22 when the Territory’s total\ntaxation and own-source revenue efforts were 86.2% and 123.5%, respectively. The Territory’s\nreduced taxation effort over this period is predominantly a result of lower stamp duty on\nconveyances, due to a reduction in the value of property conveyed relative to the national\naverage and fewer large one-off transactions in 2022-23 compared with 2021-22. The reduced\nown-source revenue effort reflects the same factors affecting the taxation effort, in addition to\nlower key commodity prices and production relative to other states over the same period.\nRevenue capacity\nStates are limited to growing their own-source revenues by either replacing current taxes with a\nnew growth tax or expanding existing tax bases. States are unable to raise excise or customs duties\nunder the Australian Constitution, while the Commonwealth has long assumed the collection of\nincome tax.\nIn 2023-24, the Territory’s taxation and royalty own-source revenue comprises 11% of total\nrevenue for the non financial public sector.\nOptimally, state taxation policy balances the aims of raising sufficient revenue to fund government\nservices, minimising the tax burden and imposition of red tape for taxpayers, cultivating conditions\nfor business growth, and creating a tax environment that is competitive with other jurisdictions and\nattracts private investment.\nAlthough all states face similar constraints in raising own-source revenue, the Territory’s capacity\nto raise revenue is further limited by its relatively small resident and business tax base. This is\nillustrated in Table 6.7, which reports the CGC’s assessments of revenue-raising capacity for major\nstate taxes and mining revenue. Revenue-raising capacity is the ratio of the per capita amount\na state could raise if it applied the national average policy to its tax base, compared to actual\nper capita average revenue raised on the national tax base.

The change is mostly\ndue to a relative increase in revenue-raising capacity from mining for New South Wales and\nQueensland, which rose significantly on the back of substantial coal production.\nThe Territory is assessed as having a relatively low capacity to raise taxes, particularly land tax and\nconveyance duty, where the Territory’s capacity is significantly below the national average of 100%.\nThis reflects the Territory’s geographical composition, a relatively small number of very high value\ncommercial and residential properties, a resident population just over 250,000 and large areas of\nthe Territory with very little private property ownership.\nRepresentative taxpayer model\nThe representative taxpayer model compares the amount of tax payable in each jurisdiction by a\nrepresentative household or firm. This approach takes into account the different circumstances of\neach state by applying each state’s tax rate to a representative or average standard.\nLand tax\nThis category comprises taxes on the ownership of land, where the tax is based on the assessed\nunimproved value of the land, and any metropolitan land planning, development, and fire and\nemergency service levies included in the land tax base of some states.\nLand tax is an important source of income for other states, generating more than $12.2 billion\nin revenue in 2022-23. Land tax is levied on the landowner’s total holdings of commercial land\nand residential investment property, although an exclusion is generally provided for land used for\nprimary production. Land tax rates are usually progressive and most jurisdictions have tax-free\nthresholds.\nThe Territory does not impose a land tax.

Additional levies imposed in other jurisdictions include fire and\nemergency service levies, motor taxes, traffic improvement levies and road safety contributions.\nTax expenditure statement\nThe tax expenditure statement details revenue estimated to be forgone by the government or\nfinancial benefits obtained by taxpayers as a result of tax exemptions or concessions. Identifying\nthis expenditure (or forgone revenue) assists in providing a more accurate picture of the\ngovernment’s contribution by way of taxation concessions to assist various groups or industries.\nTax concessions are often provided to benefit a specified activity or class of taxpayer. They are\nexpenditures in the sense the impact on budget outcomes is similar to direct expenditure outlays\nand could be used to achieve similar goals to grant programs.\nTax expenditure can be provided in a variety of ways, including by way of tax exemption, waiver,\ndeduction, rebate or a concessionary tax rate.\nThe tax expenditure identified in this statement relates to the major concessions available in the\nTerritory. In accordance with section 10(1)(d) of the FITA, the tax expenditure statement provides\nan estimate of expenditure (or forgone revenue) in 2023-24, and estimates for 2024-25 and the\nfollowing three financial years.\nTable 6.10 details the total estimated tax expenditure across payroll tax, stamp duty and motor\nvehicle fees.\nTable 6.10: Total tax expenditure1\n2023-24 2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28\nTax expenditure ($M) 204.9 208.4 218.8 229.9 241.3\n1 Does not include forgone land tax.\nMethodology\nTax expenditure has been estimated by applying the benchmark rate of taxation to the forecast\nvolume of activities or assets exempted by a particular concession. Only future events certain or\nhighly likely to affect assumed tax bases or tax rates have been included when estimating future tax\nexpenditure. Otherwise, existing taxation arrangements are assumed to apply for future years.\nMeasuring tax expenditure requires the identification of:\n• a benchmark tax base\n• concessionary taxed components of the benchmark tax base, such as specific activity or class\nof taxpayer\n• a benchmark tax rate to apply to the concessionary taxed components of the tax base.\nThe establishment of a benchmark tax base provides a basis against which each tax concession can\nbe evaluated. The aim of the benchmark is to determine which concessions are tax expenditures\nrather than structural elements of the tax.\nBy definition, tax expenditure comprises those tax concessions not included as part of the\nbenchmark tax base.\nTerritory taxes and royalties | 73", "text_len": 2971, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The tax\nexpenditure in Table 6.11 has been calculated by adding actual tax concessions to an estimate of\nconcessions. The estimate is derived by comparing the average of Australian Taxation Office data\nreporting wages paid by employers in the Territory and ABS data on employment and wages in the\nTerritory, to data reported by employers registered for payroll tax in the Territory. The difference\nprovides a reasonable estimate of wages paid by employers that are not subject to Territory payroll\ntax because of the small business exclusion (detailed below) or for being an exempt body.\nPayroll tax expenditure estimates over the budget cycle have weakened in comparison to forecasts\nmade in the 2023-24 Budget. The number of employed persons in the Territory remained stable\nwhile per capita average weekly earnings continued to increase. This contributes to an aggregate\ndecrease in the value of payroll tax expenditure as a larger number of existing businesses no longer\nfall under the tax-free threshold. The reported estimated tax expenditure in relation to payroll tax\nmainly comprises the following exemptions.\nSmall business exclusion\nEmployers with total Australian wages below $1.5 million are not required to pay payroll tax,\nsaving them up to $82,500 per annum. The payroll tax liability for employers with payrolls above\n$1.5 million a year is calculated on taxable wages less a deduction based on a sliding scale of up to\n$1.5 million. This category comprises the majority of the estimated payroll tax revenue forgone.\nCharities and other exempt bodies\nCertain charitable and not-for-profit organisations receive payroll tax exemptions for wages paid\nto employees who engage in non-commercial activities that support the organisation’s charitable\npurpose. In addition, employment agencies providing temporary staff to exempt organisations are\nable to claim payroll tax exemptions for these wages.\nStamp duty on conveyances\nTax expenditure estimates in Table 6.12 are based on actual stamp duty data.\nTable 6.12: Stamp duty on conveyances expenditure\n2023-24 2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28\nTax expenditure ($M) 11.4 5.5 5.6 5.7 5.9\nForecast expenditure (forgone revenue) over the forward estimates is anticipated to decline from\n2023-24 and remain stable over the forward estimates. A large, one-off corporate reconstruction in\n2023-24 contributed to higher than expected expenditure for that period, and is an outlier result.\nThe stability in total tax expenditure over the forward estimates period is due to the absence of\nhome owner stamp duty concessions in the Territory, which would typically introduce a degree of\nvolatility in expenditure in this area.\n74 | Territory taxes and royalties", "text_len": 3215, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Section 5(1)(d) of the\nFITA requires government to manage financial risks faced by the Territory prudently (having regard\nto economic circumstances), including by maintaining Territory debt at prudent levels.\nThis section meets the FITA requirements by outlining potential risks to the budget due to changes\nin factors underpinning revenue and expenditure estimates, and the likelihood of contingent\nliabilities becoming actual liabilities.\nRisks to the Territory are assessed and categorised in accordance with those identified in\nsection 5(2) of the FITA, comprising risks from excessive debt, risks from the ownership of trading\nentities, risks from erosion of the Territory’s revenue base, risks from managing assets and liabilities,\nand other risks.\nFor more information on the Territory’s risks and contingent liabilities refer to the 2022-23\nTreasurer’s Annual Financial Report Note 42, Contingent assets and liabilities.\nSound fiscal management of risks\nRisks from excessive debt\nExcessive debt levels could affect the Territory’s ability to raise funds when required, or at a\ncost substantially higher than could be achieved under more sustainable debt levels, limiting\ngovernment’s capacity to maintain appropriate levels of service. Furthermore, excessive debt\ncould impact investor and consumer confidence, resulting in negative effects on the broader\nTerritory economy.\nRisks associated with excessive debt are mitigated by a limit on government borrowings to\n$15 billion as legislated in the FITA, diversifying borrowing and investment activities across a\nmaturity spectrum using a variety of funding sources, and adherence to government’s fiscal\nstrategy objectives.\nOne of government’s fiscal strategy objectives is to maintain or improve the Territory’s credit rating.\nCredit ratings reflect an independent assessment of a government’s credit worthiness and ability\nto fulfil its financial commitments and repay debt.

The corporation’s board oversees a\ngas sales strategy to address future market opportunities and position the corporation to ensure\ncosts are covered by revenue, and any risks are appropriately mitigated.\nGovernment has further strengthened oversight of the Territory’s strategic energy security,\nby establishing the Gas Strategy Steering Committee, comprising chief executive officers from\nrelevant agencies and Power and Water Corporation to oversee measures to mitigate immediate to\nlong-term risks around gas supply.\nRisks from erosion of the Territory’s revenue base\nReliance on Commonwealth funding\nAustralia’s federal system is characterised by a high level of vertical fiscal imbalance, where the\nexpenditure requirements of states under the Australian Constitution far outweigh their capacity\nto raise revenue. This imbalance is addressed through intergovernmental payments from the\nCommonwealth to the states to facilitate the delivery of essential services.\nIn comparison to all other states, the Territory is more reliant on Commonwealth payments due to\ngreater expenditure needs and a lower ability to fund expenditure through own-source revenue. In\n2024-25, Commonwealth funding to the Territory is expected to account for 72% of the Territory’s\ntotal revenue, with GST revenue and tied funding payments accounting for 48% and 24% of total\nrevenue, respectively, in the non financial public sector. Due to the Territory’s reliance on these\nfunding sources, any changes will have a significant effect on Territory revenue.

The following analysis examines the effect of variations of each parameter\nin isolation. However, as these parameters interact with each other, variations can have a\ncompounding or offsetting effect on GST revenue estimates.\nGST collections pool\nThe Territory’s GST revenue is directly affected by variations in the national GST collections pool,\nwith growth in the pool representing the largest driver of change to the Territory’s GST revenue\nforecasts since the 2023-24 Budget. The factors influencing the national GST collections pool are\ndiscussed in Chapter 5 Commonwealth revenue.\nThe risks to the national GST collections pool forecasts relate to the outlook for national nominal\nconsumption of goods and services subject to GST and private dwelling investment. Results may\nvary from forecasts if nominal prices or real economic activity is materially different to expectations.\nParticular uncertainty arises for the 2024-25 Budget around the extent to which inflation returns\nto target bands and any corresponding interest rate reductions, as inflation is currently above\nbut on track to return to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s inflation target band of 2% to 3%. Other\neconomic indicators, such as employment and wages outcomes, can also impact consumption\nand investment spending, and these indicators may influence monetary policy decisions. Territory\nGST forecasts are based on recent economic outlooks, which include major policy announcements\nsuch as the Commonwealth’s scheduled income tax reductions. If there are any new major policy\nchanges, or if the economic reaction to these policies is larger or smaller than expected, this may\nalso impact GST collections pool outcomes.\nA ±1 percentage point change in the GST collections pool growth rate is estimated to have a\n±$41 million impact on the Territory’s GST revenue in 2024-25, all else being equal. If a variation\nof ±1 percentage point was applied to GST collections pool growth rates in each of the budget\nand forward estimate years, the cumulative impact on Territory GST revenue would be around\n±$439 million.\nTerritory’s share of the national population\nEstimates of each state and territory’s population growth relative to the national rate influence the\nTerritory’s share of the national population, affecting forecasts of the Territory’s GST revenue.\nRisks and contingent liabilities | 79", "text_len": 3192, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Estimates of other states’ populations are based on\nCommonwealth population projections. Accordingly, the Territory’s GST revenue projections are\nsensitive to the Territory’s forecasts of Territory population growth, as well as Commonwealth\nforecasts of interstate population growth. The Territory’s population is expected to grow at a\nslower rate than the national population over 2024-25 and the forward estimates. Chapter 4 of the\nNorthern Territory Economy book provides more detail on the Territory’s population characteristics\nand forecast growth patterns.\nThe effect of a ±1,000 person variation in the Territory’s population forecast is expected to have\na ±$31 million impact in 2024-25, all else being equal. The cumulative impact of a ±1,000 person\nvariation in the Territory’s population each year over the budget and the forward estimates would\nbe about ±$81 million.\nGST relativity\nThe distribution of GST revenue is based on the principles of HFE that aim to provide all states\nwith the capacity to provide similar levels of services and infrastructure.\nThe CGC recommends GST relativities annually, and incorporates new data and changes in state\nfiscal capacities. In the 2024 Update, the CGC recommended an increase in the Territory’s GST\nrelativity to 5.06681 for 2024-25 from 4.98725 in 2023-24.\nRelativities are subject to calculations based on the financial and demographic circumstances\nof all states and territories in a rolling three-year assessment period, updated annually. As a\nresult of the methodology associated with estimating GST relativities, the Territory forecasts\nrelativities on a three-year average basis, held constant over the forward estimates period,\nadjusted for GST distribution reforms. In any relativity update, the Territory’s GST relativity will\nbe sensitive to changes in all jurisdictions’ relativities, reflecting the fixed sum nature of the GST\ndistribution process.\nRisks to the Territory forecast arise if any state’s relativity circumstances vary significantly from\nits three-year average over the forecast period. Recent relativities have varied substantially due\nto factors such as covid, which will continue to impact data for at least two years. Mineral royalty\nproduction volumes and values, particularly for coal, data revisions to population, demographic\nand socio-economic data following the 2021 Census, and levels of capital and urban transport\ninvestment, have all affected the Territory’s 2024-25 relativity. Relativity calculation methods are\nreviewed every five years with the next review due in 2025. Any change to calculation methods\nwill affect relativities from 2025-26.\nThe impact of a ±0.1 variation in the Territory’s GST relativity is about ±$78 million in 2024-25, all\nelse being equal. A ±0.1 variation in the Territory’s GST relativity in each of the budget and forward\nestimate years would have a cumulative effect of about ±$338 million.\nGST distribution reforms\nThe Commonwealth has legislated changes to the GST distribution system through the\nTreasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST)\nAct 2018. These reforms are discussed in Chapter 5 Commonwealth revenue.\nThe reforms include a Commonwealth temporary no-worse-off guarantee that operates as a\ntime-limited safety net for jurisdictions. This ensures jurisdictions receive, at a minimum, the\ncumulative amount of GST they would have received under the previous methodology. This\nguarantee temporarily mitigates the risks of GST distribution reforms to the Territory’s GST.\n80 | Risks and contingent liabilities", "text_len": 3750, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Mining revenue forecasts\nare informed by independent assessments of commodity prices and market conditions, and advice\nfrom mining companies about their expectations of production, prices and royalty obligations over\nthe budget and forward estimate years. Changes in commodity prices, mine end of life estimates,\nand production or exchange rates can materially impact these forecasts.\nInternational economic conditions following the covid pandemic and trends in electric vehicle\nmarkets have contributed to the significant volatility of key commodity prices due to a\nsupply-demand imbalance. Further, inflationary pressures have increased operating costs for\nmines, potentially affecting profitability, which will flow through to mineral royalty forecasts over\nthe forward estimates. In March 2024, Cyclone Megan crossed the Gulf of Carpentaria coast\nand impacted major mines located in Borroloola and Groote Eylandt. While the 2024-25 Budget\nincorporates lower mining royalty revenue in 2023-24 and 2024-25 to reflect the suspension\nof mining operations, the uncertainty of costs and duration of returning the mines to normal\noperations poses a risk to the Territory’s royalty revenue projections.\nPayroll tax is the Territory’s largest source of tax revenue and is imposed on businesses with total\npayroll above the tax-free threshold of $1.5 million per annum. Payroll tax forecasts are influenced\nby employment, wages and business investment projections.\nThe Territory’s conveyance and related duty is derived from direct and indirect conveyances of\nproperty in the Territory. Forecasting for conveyance duty is linked to the outlook for the property\nmarket with commercial transactions linked to economic conditions and sentiment more broadly.\nThe extent and timing of any market changes in terms of property prices and transaction volumes\ncan be volatile and directly affects conveyance duty collections.\nConveyance duty forecasts are influenced by the size of the Territory’s conveyance duty base,\nwhich includes valuable commercial properties such as pastoral properties, mining projects and\ncommercial precincts. The duty collected in respect of large commercial transactions contributes\nsignificant volatility to conveyance duty collections.\nUnlike tax revenue from property transactions or employment, gambling tax revenue is not as\nclosely correlated with the economic or business cycle. Lower than expected lotteries tax will be\noffset by stronger than expected community gaming machine and casino tax in 2023-24, which\nmay indicate a shift in consumer preferences.\nIn total, a variation of ±1% to the forecast of Territory taxes and royalties would affect revenue by\nabout ±$9.2 million in 2024-25.\nAn emerging risk to state and territory taxes has arisen following the case of Vanderstock & Anor\nversus the state of Victoria. The High Court of Australia found that a road-user charge imposed\nby the state of Victoria, on registered owners of particular vehicles, was unconstitutional. The\nbasis for the High Court decision has cast doubt on the validity of other state and territory taxes,\nwith at least two states currently facing legal challenges. In the event that similar legal challenges\nare upheld, in relation to other state and territory taxes, levies or duties, Australian states and\nterritories are at risk of further erosion of own-source revenue, and an increased reliance on\nCommonwealth funding.\n82 | Risks and contingent liabilities", "text_len": 3748, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The indemnities generally cannot be\ncalled upon where there is wilful or gross misconduct on the part of the beneficiary.\nLand development\nThe Territory has contingent liabilities that relate to guarantees provided by the Land Development\nCorporation in order to facilitate specific land release projects.\nNative title\nThe Territory has a contingent liability under the Native Title Act 1993 relating to an obligation to\npay compensation to native title holders where the Territory commits an action that extinguishes\nor impairs a native title holder’s rights. There have been a number of claims filed with the\nFederal Court under the Native Title Act 1993, however, it is not possible to reliably estimate the\nTerritory’s liability in respect of these and any future claims.\nProperty and business services\nAgreements for leases or licences of property, plant or equipment generally contain standard\nindemnity provisions, similar to those commonly found in commercial leases, covering the lessor or\nlicensor for any losses suffered as a result of the lease or licence arrangement.\nThe granting of a concession to Darwin Cove Convention Centre Pty Ltd gives rise to contingent\nliabilities associated with:\n• discriminatory changes in law\n• environmental clean-up costs\n• incentive payments to the operator if performance targets established for the centre are exceeded\n• negotiated payments to the operator during the centre’s operation.\nFor the categories listed above, neither the probability nor the amount the Territory might be called\nupon to pay at some future date can be determined reliably. As a result, these items are regarded\nas contingent liabilities.\nA contingent asset also arises as a consequence of the concession arrangement. The Territory\nAvailability Payment is recognised as a liability on the general government sector and whole of\ngovernment balance sheets. However, the Territory has the right to recover up to 75% of that liability\nshould the operator not achieve certain performance criteria. Because neither the probability of\nsuch a recovery nor the amount that might be recovered can be determined reliably, the part of the\nTerritory Availability Payment that may be subject to abatement is classified as a contingent asset.\n88 | Risks and contingent liabilities", "text_len": 3017, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
