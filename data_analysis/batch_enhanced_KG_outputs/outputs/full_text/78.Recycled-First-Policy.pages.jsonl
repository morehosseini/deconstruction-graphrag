A key intent of Recycling\nVictoria is to optimise the use of recycled and reused Victorian materials in transport infrastructure\nprojects through the Recycled First Policy.\nFrom 1 March 2020, all tenderers on Victorian major transport infrastructure projects are required to\ndemonstrate within their tender, how they will optimise the use of recycled and reused materials at the\nlevels allowed under current standards and specifications. Tenderers may also identify opportunities to\ntrial new innovative products or opportunities to drive improvements to recycled and reused material\nquantities within current standards and specifications. Successful tenderers must report against their\nRecycled First Commitments periodically during delivery. This will help ensure consideration is given to\nrecycled and reused materials over virgin materials and divert useful materials from landfill. The\nRecycled First Policy will also enable continuous improvements to transport standards and\nspecifications, research and development and create greener more sustainable transport infrastructure\noutcomes.\n2 Background\nAs a large buyer of goods and services the Victorian Government can help create strong markets for\nrecycled materials. Through the Recycled First Policy, the government is seeking new opportunities to\npurchase products containing Victorian recycled materials and use recycled materials to build roads,\nrailways and other public infrastructure.\nVictorian Government infrastructure projects already use recycled materials, but quantities have not\nbeen effectively reported on and there has not been a requirement to optimise their / its use. The intent\nof the Policy is to optimise the use of recycled and reused materials within major transport projects,\nbuild a better understanding of the types, volumes and location of recycled and reused material use and\nsupport innovation.\nRecycled First is mandatory and will apply to contractors supplying into projects that fall within the\nscope of the Policy.\nThis Policy includes the Recycled First Guidance Notes and the Recycled First Procurement\nImplementation Guide which contains procedures and guidelines for agencies, project teams and\ncontractors to follow in complying with the Policy.\n3 Scope\nThe Recycled First Policy and associated implementation guidelines applies to all major transport\ninfrastructure projects (undertaken by delivery agencies) and in time, Department of Transport (DoT)\ntransport infrastructure projects and operational and maintenance (O & M) activities. It also has the\npotential to be applied to other State Government department and agency projects and operational and\nmaintenance activities. The first application of the Policy relates directly to major transport infrastructure\nprojects. The Government will review this with a view to including social and other infrastructure sectors\nin the future.\nProjects and O & M activities at tender or in contract prior to 1 March 2020\nThese projects are not bound by the Recycled First Policy. DoT and its delivery agencies will continue\nto work with project, operations and maintenance teams and contractors to encourage the use of\nrecycled and reused materials on transport infrastructure projects and to improve the reporting of the\nproducts and quantity of recycled and reused materials used within existing contract parameters.\nRecycled First Policy March 2020 2", "text_len": 3579, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Contract\ndocumentation will be amended to reflect Policy requirements. Compliance will be the responsibility of\nthe procuring agency and project contractors. The delivery agencies will have oversight, monitoring,\nreporting and compliance responsibilities including auditing of contractor Recycled First plans and data\ncollected.\nProjects tendered from 1 January 2022\nThe Recycled First Policy and associated implementation guidelines will apply to DoT road and rail\ntransport infrastructure and O & M projects including major projects, alliances and operational contracts,\nthat align with the Local Jobs First Policy and Social Procurement Framework (SPF) thresholds.\nContract documentation will be amended to reflect Policy requirements, scaled to reflect contract size\nand contract opportunities. Compliance will be the responsibility of DoT, O & M and project contractors.\nThe DoT will have oversight, monitoring, reporting and compliance responsibilities.\n4 Recycled First Policy Objectives\nThe intent of this Recycled First Policy is to:\n• Optimise the use of recycled and reused materials on Victorian transport infrastructure projects\n• Drive the supply, demand, technical development and application of reused and recycled\nproducts\n• Encourage innovation in transport infrastructure construction to improve quality and accelerate\nthe implementation of new Victorian recycled products\n• Provide data on recycled and reused materials to help inform a better understanding of the supply\nchain, market development issues and opportunities and future recycling infrastructure need\n• Help achieve sustainable outcomes for transport projects\n• Support the initiatives of the Recycling Victoria Policy\n5 Recycled First Policy\nThis Recycled First Policy will ensure that, where appropriate, recycled and reused materials are used\ninstead of virgin materials to drive greater use of these materials, encourage innovation and develop new\nmarkets. This will require projects to show they have considered the use of recycled or reused materials\nduring the procurement phase, in design and during construction. Incentivising greater use of these\nmaterials will also improve the Government’s information base to better identify supply and demand in the\nmarket.\nThis Recycled First Policy supports the Recycled Victoria Policy and the Victorian Government’s intent to\noptimise the use of recycled and reused materials in transport infrastructure projects.\nThis Recycled First Policy requirements will be included in all new major transport infrastructure project\ntender documents as part of the technical solution delivery methodology.\nThis Recycled First Policy requires that for these projects:\n• tenderers must demonstrate how they will optimise the use of recycled materials\n• contractors must report on the types and volumes of recycled products they have used as per\ntheir contract requirements.\nRecycled First Policy March 2020 3", "text_len": 3157, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "78.Recycled-First-Policy.pdf", "page_num": 4, "text": "This Policy will apply to the use of recycled materials in applications that are already approved in current\nDoT and rail operator standards and specifications. Currently allowed materials include reclaimed asphalt\npavement, crushed glass, crushed concrete, fly ash, slag, crushed brick, crumb rubber and steel.\nTenderers may also identify opportunities for innovative uses of recycled materials, including trials of new\nand emerging materials. The material volumes that are proposed by successful tenderers in their\nRecycled First Plan in the tender phase will be incorporated as contractual requirements, with associated\nreporting requirements to be included in the contract.\nWhere a tenderer believes that no, or limited, opportunities for the use of recycled and reused Victorian\nmaterials exist in relation to a project, the tenderer will be required to provide an explanation of the limiting\nfactors, for example, price, availability, suitability, or durability concerns.\nProject teams will continue to work with contractors throughout the life of the contract to further optimise\nthe use of recycled and reused materials, where appropriate.\n5.1 Recycled First Policy Projects\nThis Recycled First Policy applies to Victorian Government major transport infrastructure projects\nprocured from 1 March 2020. The Government will evaluate Recycled First and consider if it is appropriate\nto expand this approach to other Government procurement activity.\nLocal governments will be encouraged and supported to adopt a similar approach to the Victorian\nGovernment.\n5.2 Recycled First Policy Relationships\nThis Recycled First Policy has touchpoints with the Local Jobs First Policy and with one of the three\nenvironmental objectives of the SPF. Guidance on the functional application of these relationships can be\nfound in the Recycled First Agency and Reference Guidelines (Attachment 1). It is important to note that\nthe three environmental objectives in the SPF are not mandated, therefore reliance on the SPF to drive\nthe required outcomes is very limited.\n6 Responsibilities\n6.1 Roles and Responsibilities\nResponsible Minister\nThe Minister for Transport Infrastructure is responsible for this Recycled First Policy, associated guidance\ndocuments and model contract clauses. Current priorities have required the Minister of Transport\nInfrastructure to delegate this responsibility to the Minister of Roads and Public Transport.\nDepartment of Transport (DoT)\nDoT is responsible for developing the Policy, standards, specifications, model clauses and establishing\nstructures to support its delivery across delivery agencies.\nDelivery agencies\nDelivery agencies, mainly Major Transport Infrastructure Authority (MTIA) and Suburban Rail Loop\nAuthority (SRLA) are responsible for developing the model clauses and related guidelines and for applying\nthe requirements of this Policy and related guidelines to all Recycled First projects.\n7 Tender Weightings and Targets\nThis Recycled First Policy makes provision for weightings to be considered on a project-by-project basis.\nThis is to ensure that appropriate supply chain development is considered in the planning and delivery of\nthe project. The weighting will need to be reflective of the State’s focus on this Policy and intended\nRecycled First Policy March 2020 4", "text_len": 3312, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
