Investors are looking beyond\nshort-term financial gains and focusing on long-term sustainability,\nevaluating how companies manage resources, reduce waste, and\ndesign products for longevity and recyclability. Companies with\nstrong circular practices are being rewarded with higher ESG scores,\nreflecting their resilience and alignment with global sustainability\ngoals.\n• Disclosure standards: Global disclosure frameworks, such as the\nthose developed by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial\nDisclosures (TCFD) and the International Sustainability Standards\nBoard (ISSB) guidelines, are beginning to incorporate circular\neconomy considerations. Companies are increasingly expected\nto disclose their resource use, waste management strategies,\nand efforts to close material loops, giving investors better\ninsights into their sustainability performance.\n• Financial products and bonds: The financial sector is seeing\na rise in sustainability-linked bonds and green bonds that target\ncircular economy outcomes. These financial instruments are tied\nto measurable sustainability goals, such as reducing waste or\nincreasing the use of recycled materials, providing both financial\nreturns and environmental benefits. For example, the European\nInvestment Bank, alongside Europe’s largest public and promotional\nbanks, has committed €16 billion to finance circular economy\nprojects by 2025.\nThis growing focus on circularity within financial frameworks not only\ndrives more sustainable business practices but also signals a broader\nshift in how value is measured – moving from a purely financial\nperspective to one that accounts for environmental impact and\nresource efficiency.\nThe Australian Government is contributing to this shift by creating\na Nature Repair Market and establishing the Nature Finance Council.\nThese initiatives aim to facilitate investment in projects that restore\nand protect natural environments, aligning financial flows with nature-\npositive outcomes.\nAustralia’s Measuring What Matters framework integrates\nsustainability indicators, ensuring that factors such as resource\nefficiency and ecological health are considered in national policy\nand investment decisions. Additionally, the introduction of climate\ndisclosure requirements in Australia is expected to foster\ntransparency and encourage more sustainable business practices.\n33 | Australia’s Circular Economy Framework Return to table of contents", "text_len": 2905, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
