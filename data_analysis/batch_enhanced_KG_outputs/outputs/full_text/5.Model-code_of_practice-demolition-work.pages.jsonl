Following an approved code of practice will assist the duty holder to\nachieve compliance with the health and safety duties in the WHS Act and WHS Regulations,\nin relation to the subject matter of the code of practice. Like regulations, codes of practice\ndeal with particular issues and may not cover all relevant hazards or risks. The health and\nsafety duties require duty holders to consider all risks associated with work, not only those\nfor which regulations and codes of practice exist.\nCodes of practice are admissible in court proceedings under the WHS Act and\nWHS Regulations. Courts may regard a code of practice as evidence of what is known about\na hazard, risk, risk assessment or risk control and may rely on the code in determining what\nis reasonably practicable in the circumstances to which the code of practice relates.\nFor further information see the Interpretive Guideline: The meaning of ‘reasonably\npracticable’.\nCompliance with the WHS Act and WHS Regulations may be achieved by following another\nmethod, if it provides an equivalent or higher standard of work health and safety than\nthe code.\nAn inspector may refer to an approved code of practice when issuing an improvement or\nprohibition notice.\nScope and application\nThis Code is intended to be read by a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU).\nIt provides practical guidance to PCBUs on how to manage health and safety risks\nassociated with demolition work.\nThe guidance in this Code is relevant to demolition contractors as well as PCBUs who have\nmanagement or control of workplaces where excavation work is carried out, for example\nprincipal contractors.\nThis Code may be a useful reference for other persons interested in the duties under the\nWHS Act and WHS Regulations.\nThis Code applies to all workplaces covered by the WHS Act where demolition work is\ncarried out and where demolition work products and equipment are used and stored.\nPersons who have duties in relation to demolition work should also refer to the\nCode of Practice: Construction work.\nHow to use this Code of Practice\nThis Code includes references to the legal requirements under the WHS Act and\nWHS Regulations. These are included for convenience only and should not be relied on in\nplace of the full text of the WHS Act or WHS Regulations.

Introduction\n1.1 What is demolition work?\nDemolition work means work to demolish or dismantle a structure or part of a structure that\nis load-bearing or otherwise related to the physical integrity of the structure, but does\nnot include:\nthe dismantling of formwork, falsework, scaffolding or other structures designed or\n­\nused to provide support, access or containment during construction work, or\nthe removal of power, light or telecommunication poles.\n­\nA structure is anything that is constructed, whether fixed or moveable, temporary or\npermanent, and includes buildings, sheds, towers, chimney stacks, silos, storage tanks.\nDemolition work is a type of ‘construction work’. Therefore, when carrying out demolition\nwork, the requirements relating to construction work must also be complied with.\nDemolition work is also ‘high risk construction work’ if it involves demolition of an element of\na structure that is load-bearing or otherwise related to the physical integrity of the structure.\nA Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) must be prepared before the high risk construction\nwork starts. Further guidance on SWMS is available in section 3.4 of this Code.\nFurther guidance on construction work and high risk construction work duties is available in\nthe Code of Practice: Construction work.\nOther key terms relating to demolition work are listed in Appendix A.\n1.2 Who has health and safety duties in relation to\ndemolition work?\nDuty holders who have a role in managing the risks of demolition work include:\npersons conducting a business or undertaking (PCBUs)\n­\ndesigners, manufacturers, importers, suppliers and installers of plant, substances or\n­\nstructures, and\nofficers.\n­\nWorkers and other persons at the workplace also have duties under the WHS Act, such as\nthe duty to take reasonable care for their own health and safety at the workplace.\nA person can have more than one duty and more than one person can have the same duty\nat the same time.\nEarly consultation and identification of risks can allow for more options to eliminate or\nminimise risks and reduce the associated costs.\nThe main duties in relation to managing the risks of demolition work are set out in Chapter 2.\nPerson conducting a business or undertaking\nWHS Act section 19\nPrimary duty of care\nDemolition work\nCode of Practice Page 7 of 59", "text_len": 2324, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This involves finding things and situations that could potentially cause harm\nto people. Hazards generally arise from the following aspects of work and their interaction:\nphysical work environment\n­\nequipment, materials and substances used\n­\nwork tasks and how they are performed, and\n­\nwork design and management.\n­\nHazards may be identified by looking at the workplace and how work is carried out. It is also\nuseful to talk to workers, manufacturers, suppliers and health and safety specialists and\nreview relevant information, records and incident reports.\nPotential demolition hazards arise in a number of ways, including:\nunplanned structure collapse\n­\nfalls from one level to another\n­\nDemolition work\nCode of Practice Page 15 of 59", "text_len": 1855, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

A risk assessment can help you determine:\nhow severe a risk is\n­\nwhether any existing control measures are effective\n­\nwhat action you should take to control the risk, and\n­\nhow urgently the action needs to be taken.\n­\nHazards have the potential to cause different types and severities of harm, ranging from\nminor discomfort to a serious injury or death.\nMany hazards and their associated risks are well known and have well established and\naccepted control measures. In these situations, the second step in the process outlined in\nsection 1.3 of this Code to formally assess the risk is not required. If, after identifying a\nhazard, you already know the risk and how to control it effectively, you may simply\nimplement the controls.\nIn some circumstances, a risk assessment will assist to:\nidentify which workers are at risk of exposure\n­\ndetermine what sources and processes are causing the risk\n­\nidentify if and what kind of control measures should be implemented, and\n­\ncheck the effectiveness of existing control measures.\n­\nThe nature and severity of risks will depend on various factors, including the:\nthe structure to be demolished and its structural integrity\n­\nthe method of demolition including its sequencing\n­\nthe scheduling of the work\n­\nthe layout of the workplace including whether there are fall hazards both for people\n­\nand objects\nwhat plant and equipment will be used and the skill and experience required by the\n­\npeople who will use it safely\nwhat exposures might occur, for example to noise or ultraviolet (UV) rays\n­\nthe number of people involved, and\n­\nlocal weather conditions.\n­\nFurther guidance on the risk management process and the hierarchy of control measures is\navailable in the Code of Practice: How to manage work health and safety risks.\nDemolition work\nCode of Practice Page 16 of 59", "text_len": 2544, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

These incidents need to be investigated to find the hazard that caused the\ninjury or illness.\n2.3 Controlling the risks\nWHS Regulation 142\nNotice of demolition work\nThe hierarchy of control measures\nThe WHS Regulations require duty holders to work through the hierarchy of control\nmeasures when managing certain risks; however, the hierarchy can be applied to any risk.\nThe hierarchy ranks control measures from the highest level of protection and reliability to\nthe lowest.\nEliminating the risk\nYou must always aim to eliminate the risk. For example, undertake work at ground level to\neliminate the use of cranes and the need to work at height. If eliminating the hazards and\nassociated risks is not reasonably practicable, you must minimise the risk by one or more of\nthe following:\nSubstitution—minimise the risk by substituting or replacing a hazard or hazardous\n­\nwork practice with something that gives rise to a lesser risk.

For example, using concrete barriers to\nseparate pedestrians and powered mobile plant to reduce the risk of collision.\nEngineering controls—engineering controls are physical control measures to\n­\nminimise risk. For example, fitting an open cab excavator with a protective structure\nto minimise the risk of being struck by a falling object.\nIf risk remains, it must be minimised by implementing administrative controls, so far as is\nreasonably practicable, for example by installing warning signs.\nAny remaining risk must be minimised with suitable PPE, for example providing workers with\nhard hats, hearing protectors and high visibility vests.\nAdministrative control measures and PPE do not control the hazard at the source. They rely\non human behaviour and supervision and used on their own tend to be the least effective in\nminimising risks.\nChapters 4-6 of this Code provide information on control measures for demolition work.\nDemolition work\nCode of Practice Page 17 of 59", "text_len": 2803, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Buildings and structures should generally be demolished in\nreverse order to their construction, that is, by ‘sequential demolition’. In particular:\nsequential demolition should be carried out in reasonably even stages, commencing\n­\nfrom the roof or top of the building or structure being demolished\nmultistorey buildings or structures should be demolished storey by storey, and\n­\nmasonry and brickwork should be taken down in reasonably even courses.\n­\nThere is a range of demolition methods that may be used, either separately or in\ncombination. Control measures should be selected on the basis of the demolition method(s)\nused. However, no matter what method is used, the building or structure to be demolished\nand all its components should be maintained in a safe and stable condition so as to prevent\nthe unexpected collapse of part or all of the structure. Temporary braces, propping, shoring,\nor guys may need to be added for stability.\nFurther information on demolition methods can be found in AS 2601–2001: The demolition\nof structures.\n4.11 Manual demolition\nManual demolition should only be considered if it is not reasonably practicable to use\nmechanical demolition.\nManual demolition includes techniques where hand tools such as jack hammers, sledge-\nhammers and picks are used.\nManual demolition creates many of the hazards present in other major demolition activities\nincluding unexpected collapse, falls, falling objects, manual handling and exposure to noise,\ndust and hazardous chemicals.\nTo manage the risk of unplanned collapses, the condition of roofs, walls and floors of the\nbuilding should be assessed by a competent person before commencing demolition work.\nAreas where debris will fall should be barricaded off and signs erected to prevent people\nfrom entering before demolition starts.\nWhere concrete members are being demolished manually, the reinforcement should not be\ncut while breaking of the concrete is in progress.\nA competent person should advise on the demolition sequence where pre and post-tension\ndemolition work is undertaken.

Controlling risks when demolishing\nspecial structures\nSpecial structures are complex and/or unusual because of the nature of their construction or\ncondition. They include:\npre or post-tensioned construction\n­\npre-cast concrete panel and framed structures\n­\nstressed skin structures such as buildings that rely on the sheeting, cladding or\n­\ndecking to stiffen and restrain the structural framework, and\nslung structures i.e. floors or roofs suspended from a framework, supported by a\n­\nstructural core.\nSpecial structures require proper planning and care to be demolished safely. An appropriate\ndemolition method and sequence should be selected and documented prior to the work\ncommencing. A demolition plan and an assessment by a competent person of the proposed\ndemolition method may assist with this process. A person conducting a business or\nundertaking (PCBU) carrying out this work must ensure that a SWMS is prepared where\nstructural elements are to be demolished.\n5.1 Pre and post-tensioned concrete\nPre-tensioned concrete contains tendons such as wires, strands or bars that have been\ntensioned before the concrete is placed.\nPost-tensioned concrete contains tendons that have been tensioned after the concrete has\nhardened.\nTensioned tendons require controlled removal because the high level of potential energy\nstored in the tendons poses a risk to the health and safety of workers and can cause\ndamage to property. It is also important to retain structural stability during and after tendon\nremoval, prior to the final demolition of the concrete element.\nThe tendons can be subject to corrosion that weakens them and decreases the structural\nintegrity of the building. Damage is not usually evident externally, even if strand breakage is\nextensive, and conditions can vary widely even within an individual structure.\nBefore demolishing pre or post-tensioned concrete elements, review all available\ndocumentation on the building or structure including:\nbuilding plans, designs and specifications—to understand the type of tensioning\n­\nused, the load carried, anchorage points and number of tendons, and\nconstruction photographs—to obtain information on anchorage details, the\n­\nconstruction sequencing, and other measures that may affect moisture access.\nThe condition of the concrete and tendons should be considered before and during\ndemolition, for example by:\nconducting a visual inspection to confirm loads, obvious deviations from the original\n­\ndesign and waterproofing details\nassessing conditions throughout the building, as well as utilising selective testing in\n­\nrepresentative areas to assess weakening or breakage of tendons\nmeasuring humidity within tendon sheathing and analysing sheathing contaminants\n­\nremoving, inspecting and testing a small number of tendons to assess their\n­\ncondition, and\nDemolition work\nCode of Practice Page 46 of 59", "text_len": 2873, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Further information can be found in the Code of Practice: Confined spaces.\n5.5 Masonry and brick arches\nMasonry and brick arches should be demolished in a sequence allowing for the removal of\nas much of the dead load material as possible without interfering with the stability of the\nmain arch rings. The spandrel infilling should only be removed down to the springing line as\nthe load-carrying capacity of many old arches relies on the filling between the spandrels.\nIn multi-span arches, lateral restraints should be provided at the springing level before\nindividual spans are removed.\n5.6 Independent chimneys and spires\nA detailed inspection and survey should be completed prior to the demolition of a chimney or\nspire.

The possibility of chimney instability resulting from inclement weather, for\nexample during high winds, needs to be considered during all stages of demolition work.\nDue to their height, it is common for chimneys to be demolished by hand or through induced\ncollapse.

The demolition method(s) used should take into account the limits imposed by\nthe planned facade retention.\nUse guarding, hoarding and/or exclusion zones to protect persons against the risk of being\nstruck by falling debris and materials.\nThe facade or footings may need to be repaired and temporary support for the facade may\nneed to be installed before demolition work commences.
