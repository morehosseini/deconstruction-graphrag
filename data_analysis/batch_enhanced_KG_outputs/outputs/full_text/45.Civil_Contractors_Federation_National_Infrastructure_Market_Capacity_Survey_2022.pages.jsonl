CCF members are responsible for the construction and\nmaintenance of Australia’s civil infrastructure including road, bridges, pipelines, drainage, ports and\nutilities. With offices located in every capital city, CCF advocates for the industry at Federal, State /\nTerritory and local Government levels. CCF members include tier 1, 2, 3 and below civil construction\ncompanies ranging in size from 1-4 employees up to 200+ employees.\nSurvey\nThe Civil Contractors Federation National Infrastructure Market Capacity Survey 2022 was open to all\nCCF members over a three-week period in May/June 2022. The survey focused on obtaining data across\nthree key areas:\n• the market capacity of the civil construction industry;\n• the civil construction industry’s ability to undertake additional projects now, and into the future;\n• any resource constraints affecting civil construction companies\nRecommendations\nBased on the outcome of the survey, CCF is pleased to provide the results of this survey to help industry\nand government better understand the steps needed to ensure there are sufficient market capacity in\nthe civil construction sector to support a thriving and sustainable industry. The survey’s findings /\nrecommendations include the following:\n• The civil construction sector is not operating at capacity, with the survey showing a large\nproportion of companies can take on additional work.\n• More than three quarters of companies can ‘scale up’ to meet additional work within 6 months,\nbut their ability to do so effectively would be impacted by contract size.\n• A key to activating this additional capacity is to ‘rescale, not reduce’ and for a smoothing of the\ninfrastructure pipeline over the long term and bringing to market more small/mid-sized\ninfrastructure projects.\n1\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n• the market capacity of the civil construction industry;\n• the civil construction industry’s ability to undertake additional projects now, and into the future;\n• any resource constraints affecting civil construction companies\nRecommendations\nBased on the outcome of the survey, CCF is pleased to provide the results of this survey to help industry\nand government better understand the steps needed to ensure there are sufficient market capacity in\nthe civil construction sector to support a thriving and sustainable industry.

{"source_file": "45.Civil Contractors Federation National Infrastructure Market Capacity Survey 2022.pdf", "page_num": 3, "text": "Respondents were asked to assess a range of threats to the delivery of infrastructure projects and were\npresented with 11 threats and asked to give each a ranking, from 1 being a low risk, to 5 being a high\nrisk. These threats were:\n• Availability of local skilled tradespeople and professionals to undertake construction projects\n• Availability of local unskilled labour force\n• Availability of skilled labour\n• Availability sand or quarry products\n• Availability concrete or cement\n• Availability Precast concrete products (e.g. pipes, pits, grates, kerbs)\n• Availability fuel or other oil products (e.g. bitumen)\n• Availability steel or steel products\n• Availability glass & related products\n• Availability timber or timber products\n• Availability construction equipment, such as dozers, graders, loaders, mixers and excavators\nIn each state and territory, the highest ranked issue was the availability of local skilled tradespeople\nand professionals to undertake construction projects.\nThis finding underscores the need for action to address a looming skills crisis in the civil infrastructure\nindustry. As a matter of urgency, CCF recommends civil construction occupations are appropriately\nclassified on the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO). This is to\nensure that employers, employees and registered training operators are eligible for relevant\nCommonwealth financial incentives, including under the Australian Apprenticeships Incentive System.\nIf the civil construction sector continues to be omitted from Australia Government skills and training\nprograms, it will deny employers, apprentices and VET providers access to relevant financial rebates and\nincentives. This omission from relevant funding programs will further exacerbate the growing skills crisis\nfacing the civil construction industry, which in turn will hamper Australia’s economic recovery from the\nCOVID 19 pandemic.\nFrom a secondary list of threats to the successful delivery of infrastructure projects, industry ranked the\nhighest threats as allocation of risk in contracts, timelines for delivering the work and insufficient pre-\nconstruction project development and risk identification.\n• Availability and cost of insurance\n• Cost of tendering / bidding for work\n• Type of procurement model used\n• Complexity of contracts used\n• Allocation of risk in contracts\n• Insufficient pre-construction project development and risk identification\n• Delays in obtaining planning and environmental approvals\n• Dealing with 3rd party asset owners\n• Timelines for delivering the work\n• Uncertainty over the infrastructure pipeline or funding.\n3", "text_len": 2650, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
