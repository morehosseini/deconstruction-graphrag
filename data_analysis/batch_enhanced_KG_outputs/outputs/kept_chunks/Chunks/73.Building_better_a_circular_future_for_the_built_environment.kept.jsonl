This includes the design and development stage, operational stages as well as the end-of-life\nof buildings.\n\nDuring the initial phase, principles such as using circular design strategies to build structures that can be dismantled and\nrepurposed after the building’s lifespan can help reduce the building’s footprint. This can be further supplemented by using bio-\nbased and renewable materials as opposed to virgin resources. Once built, a proper asset management procedure must be put in\nplace to ensure materials and products within the building are regularly maintained and renovated to extend their lifespan for as\nlong as possible. At the end of a building’s lifespan, methods such as recycling and reusing resources will be critical to reducing\nconstruction and demolition material waste, which could instead be used again as secondary raw materials for new structures.\n\nThe report also recommends other techniques such as material passports to track the journey of products across their lifecycle,\nproduct-as-service models and circularity measurement tools to ensure high-quality reuse and assist in making informed decisions\nalong the way."}
