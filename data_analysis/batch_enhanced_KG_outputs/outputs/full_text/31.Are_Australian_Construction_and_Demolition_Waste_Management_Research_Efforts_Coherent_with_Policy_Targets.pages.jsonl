A. A. Dilogini, G. Karunasena, N. Udawatta, and C. Liu\nAbstract Australia’s 2022 National Waste Report states that between 2016 and\n2021, the generation of construction and demolition waste (CDW) grew from 23.4 to\n29 million tonnes, making up 38% of all waste generated in the nation. The National\nWaste Policy Action Plan aims to increase the CDW recycling rate to 80% by 2030\nto minimize waste as one of the key priorities. In this context, CDW sector-specific\nendeavours during the recent past are vital understanding to achieve the set policy\npriorities. Thus, the chapter aims to investigate whether current construction and\ndemolition waste management (CDWM) research efforts in Australia are coherent\nwith policy targets. A systematic literature review was conducted and the study\nutilized 126 research outputs published in Web of Science and Scopus databases to\nachieve this. The PRISMA methodology was employed with imposing year restric-\ntions from 2019 to 2023. Additionally, the study referred to the federal and state/\nterritory-level policy documents to review the policy targets concerning CDWM. The\nfindings revealed that research has been conducted on five major themes: manage-\nment practices, recycling and upcycling, circular economy, stakeholder behaviour,\nand technology advancements. However, most current practices are not fully aligned\nwith national and state policy targets. To enhance alignment and effectiveness, further\nresearch should focus on integrating policy objectives and addressing existing gaps\nin practice. These findings will provide a valuable assessment of the current state\nof CDWM research efforts and serve as a roadmap for researchers and industry\npractitioners to achieve the policy targets.\n1 Introduction\nIn the 2020/21 period, Australia produced around 75.8 million tonnes of waste, with\nbuilding and demolition materials making up about 25.1 million tonnes of that total\n(Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water [DCCEEW],\nB\nR.

The sheer scale and consequences of construction and demolition waste\n(CDW) are quite concerning [17], capturing growing attention on a global scale\n[40]. These significant challenges primarily arise from the construction industry’s\nheavy reliance on conventional building methods and a linear economic model, which\noperates on a “take, make, dispose” principle ([4, 12, 13]; Illankoon and Vithanage\n2023).\nThe rise in construction and demolition waste (CDW) in Australia is largely\nattributed to rapid urbanization and the expansion of the construction industry, which\nhave together led to an increase in waste generation [33]. Disposing of these mate-\nrials in landfills presents serious environmental risks, including soil contamination,\nwater pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, stemming from the breakdown of\norganic materials and the leaching of chemicals [40]. Additionally, CDW constitutes\na significant portion of the waste sent to landfills, highlighting inefficiencies in the\ncurrent waste management practices.\nIn Australia, efforts to manage construction and demolition waste (CDW) more\nsustainably have centred on boosting recycling and resource recovery rates. Never-\ntheless, despite these initiatives, the country has fallen short of its recycling targets,\nwith the recycling rate for CDW not meeting the ambitious goals outlined by govern-\nment policies [1]. There is also an increasing awareness of the necessity to move away\nfrom a linear economy model towards a circular economy approach, which focuses on\nmaximizing the use of materials through practices like recycling, reuse, and sustain-\nable design [4, 13]. This transition is vital not only for reducing the environmental\nimpacts of waste but also for conserving natural resources and fostering economic\ngrowth [2].\nDespite extensive research on various aspects of CDWM, a critical gap remains in\nevaluating whether these efforts align with the policy objectives set by government\nauthorities. Recent reviews have highlighted that while many studies focus on tech-\nnological advancements and stakeholder behaviour, there is a limited assessment\nof how well these practices align with national- or state-level waste management\npolicies [37, 43]. Addressing this gap is crucial for ensuring that research efforts\ncontribute effectively to achieving policy goals and improving waste management\npractices across the construction industry in Australia.\nTherefore, this chapter aims to investigate whether current CDWM efforts in\nAustralia are coherent with policy targets. To achieve this aim, the chapter will:\n(1) examine the research efforts conducted in Australia over the last 5 years, (2)\nanalyse policy targets set by federal and state-level governments, (3) identify gaps in\nthe current literature regarding policy coherence, and (4) provide recommendations\nfor future research and policy development to enhance the alignment of CDWM\npractices towards sustainability.", "text_len": 2983, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The volume of CDW has consistently increased over the years,\nlargely due to the rise in urban development and construction activities. Recent\nstatistics show that Australia generated about 75.8 million tonnes of waste during\nthe 2020/21 financial year, with construction and demolition materials accounting\nfor 25.1 million tonnes of this total [10, 40].\nOver time, the management of CDW in Australia has evolved, shifting gradually\nfrom traditional disposal methods like landfilling to more sustainable approaches\nfocused on recycling and resource recovery [32]. Initially, waste management heavily\nrelied on landfills due to their lower cost and ease of use [17]. However, growing\nawareness of the environmental impacts and concerns over resource depletion have\nprompted a move towards recycling and reuse, although the outcomes have been\nmixed. The current recycling rate for CDW in Australia stands at roughly 67%, which\nindicates some progress but also underscores the need for further improvement to\nmeet leading international standards [19, 32].\nCDWM practices in Australia exhibit significant regional differences, shaped by\nlocal regulations, economic factors, and the availability of infrastructure [24]. In\nsome regions, developing more advanced recycling facilities and waste processing\ntechnologies has led to higher recovery rates for materials like concrete and metals\n[20]. Conversely, other areas struggle with inadequate infrastructure and a lack of\neconomic incentives, resulting in a heavier dependence on traditional waste disposal\nmethods [24, 46].\nThe impact of construction and demolition waste (CDW) goes beyond waste\nmanagement difficulties, influencing environmental quality and public health. When\nCDW accumulates in landfills, it can lead to soil and groundwater contamination,\nespecially if hazardous substances like asbestos and heavy metals are not prop-\nerly handled [18, 42]. Additionally, the anaerobic breakdown of organic materials\nin CDW releases greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide, which\ncontribute to climate change [15, 44]. The construction sector, a major producer of\nCDW, is also a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, with construction\nactivities making up a large part of Australia’s total carbon footprint ([14]; Oberle\net al. 2019). Economically, CDW presents a substantial burden due to disposal costs\nand the failure to utilize potentially valuable materials. Research suggests that up to\n75% of CDW materials could be recovered or repurposed, but current practices fall\nshort of this potential due to a range of regulatory, market, and behavioural barriers\n[11, 30]. For example, market dynamics often do not support the use of recycled\nmaterials because of concerns about quality and the competitive pricing of virgin\nmaterials [19, 28]. Additionally, the construction industry’s traditional preferences\nand reluctance to adopt new materials or methods have slowed the shift towards\nmore sustainable CDWM practices [25, 26]. Socially, CDW impacts include public\nhealth risks, traffic congestion due to construction activities, and increased pressure", "text_len": 3390, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

As urban expansion and popu-\nlation growth continue to drive up waste production, it is clear that without more\neffective management strategies, the challenges posed by CDW are likely to become\neven more severe in the future [8, 9].\nTo effectively tackle the significant challenges associated with construction and\ndemolition waste (CDW), it is essential to implement strong policy frameworks that\nencourage sustainable waste management practices. Recognizing the importance of\ncomprehensive strategies, Australian federal and state governments have introduced\na range of policies and action plans aimed at reducing CDW and boosting recycling\nand reuse rates within the construction sector. These policies set ambitious waste\nreduction targets and aim to align industry practices with broader environmental\nsustainability goals [1, 2, 23, 31, 39].\nOver the years, several national and state-level policies have been introduced to\nencourage sustainable practices and meet ambitious recycling and waste reduction\ngoals. On a national scale, the Australian Government has articulated its objectives\nthrough key documents like the National Waste Policy Action Plan (2019), which\naims to raise the construction and demolition (C&D) recycling rate from 51 to 75% by\n2025 [1]. The National Waste Reports (2022) offer detailed data on waste generation\nand highlight the progress and challenges in achieving these goals (Department of\nAgriculture, Water and the Environment 2022). Additionally, the National Strategy\nfor Waste and Recycling (2018) underscores the importance of adopting a circular\neconomy and enhancing recycling infrastructure to reduce reliance on landfills [2].\nAt the state and territory level, individual waste management plans align with these\nnational policies while being tailored to address local needs.\nAs shown in Table 1, both national- and state-level policies are focused on\nincreasing recycling rates and reducing the environmental impact of construction\nand demolition waste (CDW). These policies demonstrate a commitment to a circular\neconomy approach, which treats waste not as a problem but as a valuable resource to\nbe reused and recycled. However, as researchers have pointed out, the effectiveness\nof these strategies relies heavily on successful implementation, ongoing monitoring,\nand strong collaboration among stakeholders (Morris 2021; Thompson and Harris\n2020).\n3 Research Methodology\nThe research methodology for this study is based on a systematic literature review\n(SLR) aimed at evaluating how well construction and demolition waste management\n(CDWM) efforts align with national standards and policy objectives in Australia. An\nSLR was selected as the main research design because it offers a thorough overview\nof existing research on CDWM, identifies key themes, and evaluates the degree to\nwhich these studies conform to government policies.

This\nmethod allows for systematically categorizing data into themes, providing a deeper\nunderstanding of the dominant trends and gaps in the existing literature (Braun\nand Clarke 2006). Alongside the systematic literature review, a content analysis of\ngovernment documents was conducted to contextualize the study within the relevant\npolicy framework. Key documents were scrutinized to identify policy objectives,\ntargets, and strategies related to CDWM, as outlined in Table 1. These policies were\nselected based on their relevance to CDWM and their influence on shaping waste\nmanagement practices and sustainability targets. Content analysis enabled a thorough\nexamination of these documents, helping to identify overarching themes and assess\nhow well the research aligns with policy goals (Bowen 2009). Analysing policy docu-\nments was crucial for understanding the regulatory framework governing CDWM\nin Australia and evaluating whether current research efforts support or diverge from\nthese objectives. The identified themes were cross-referenced with policy objectives\noutlined in government documents to determine the alignment between research find-\nings and policy goals, highlighting areas where further integration is necessary. The\nalignment of these studies was categorized into three levels: fully aligned, partially\naligned, and not aligned with the goals set by national-and state-level policies. Fully\nAligned articles directly support the specific objectives outlined in government poli-\ncies, providing comprehensive evidence and recommendations that closely match\npolicy goals. Partially aligned articles address some aspects of the policies but do not\nfully meet all the objectives or only relate tangentially to policy goals. These arti-\ncles may cover certain components of the policies but lack a thorough engagement\nwith the policy frameworks, offering limited relevance to the intended outcomes. In\ncontrast, not aligned articles are those that do not address the policy targets at all.\n4 Findings and Discussion\nThe findings and discussion of this chapter are divided into two main sections to\nprovide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of CDWM research in Australia\nand its alignment with government policies.\n4.1 Overview of Research Conducted in Six Key Areas\nResearch on construction and demolition waste management (CDWM) in Australia\nhas been extensive and diverse, exploring a range of thematic areas. The systematic\nliterature review identified five key areas of focus: management practices, recy-\ncling and upcycling, circular economy, stakeholder behaviour, and technological\nadvancement, as illustrated in Fig. 1.", "text_len": 2871, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Effective prac-\ntices, such as on-site sorting and implementing comprehensive waste management\nplans, have been shown to significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills,\nespecially in regions where regulatory enforcement is strict [17]. However, there are\nstill notable disparities in the application of these practices across different regions\nand sectors, with some areas continuing to rely on traditional methods like land-\nfilling, which are not aligned with sustainability goals [32]. These inconsistencies\nunderscore the need for more uniform guidelines and stronger enforcement mecha-\nnisms to ensure the widespread adoption of effective waste management strategies\nthroughout Australia.\n4.3 Recycling and Upcycling\nResearch on recycling and upcycling has highlighted the vital role of material\nrecovery in reducing the environmental impact of construction activities [28, 29].\nAdvanced recycling technologies, such as automated sorting systems, have shown\nconsiderable promise in boosting the recovery rates of valuable materials from", "text_len": 1393, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

However, despite these techno-\nlogical advancements, high recycling costs and the low market value of recycled\nmaterials pose significant economic challenges to widespread adoption [28]. Many\nrecycling initiatives struggle to achieve economic viability, revealing a disconnect\nbetween the potential of recycling technologies and their practical implementation.\nThis situation underscores the need for economic incentives and policies that could\nfoster more favourable market conditions for recycled and upcycled products.\n4.4 Circular Economy\nInterest in circular economy principles has increased in recent years, with a growing\nnumber of studies examining how to integrate these principles into construction\nand demolition waste management (CDWM) to enhance resource efficiency and\nsustainability [6]. Strategies such as designing for deconstruction, reusing materials,\nand implementing closed-loop recycling have been explored to minimize waste and\nmaximize resource use. Projects that incorporate circular economy principles have\nshown significant potential in reducing waste generation and improving sustain-\nability outcomes (Ogunmakinde et al. 2023). However, the adoption of these prac-\ntices remains uneven across the industry, largely due to a lack of awareness, expertise,\nand incentives. This gap between the theoretical understanding of circular economy\nprinciples and their practical application suggests a need for more applied research\nand stronger incentives to encourage broader industry adoption [6].\n4.5 Stakeholder Behaviour\nThe role of stakeholder behaviour in the adoption of sustainable construction and\ndemolition waste management (CDWM) practices has become a significant area\nof research in recent years, underscoring the critical impact of attitudes, percep-\ntions, and economic factors on decision-making processes [34, 41]. Studies have\npointed to resistance to change and a lack of awareness among stakeholders, such\nas construction firms and waste management companies, as primary obstacles to\nadopting sustainable practices [41]. Additionally, economic disincentives, including\nthe perceived high costs of sustainable materials and methods, further deter stake-\nholders from fully embracing CDWM strategies [34]. Overcoming these behavioural\nbarriers is essential for enhancing the effectiveness of CDWM initiatives and ensuring\ngreater compliance with sustainability goals. This effort requires targeted strategies to\nincrease awareness, provide education and training, and develop economic incentives\nthat make sustainable choices more appealing to stakeholders.", "text_len": 2701, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Technologies such as Building Information Modelling\n(BIM) and smart waste management systems have shown the potential to improve\nwaste tracking and minimize material loss, thereby enhancing CDWM efficiency and\neffectiveness [17]. Despite these technological innovations, their adoption remains\nlimited due to high costs and a lack of technical expertise within the industry [34]. To\nfully realize the benefits of technological advancements, there is a need for greater\nsupport in the form of government incentives and industry training programmes,\nwhich can help overcome these barriers and facilitate broader adoption.\n5.1 Alignment of Research with Government Policies\nTo evaluate how well research aligns with government policies on construction and\ndemolition waste management (CDWM) in Australia, the following analysis catego-\nrizes studies into various themes. Each theme represents a key area of focus within\nCDWM, emphasizing different aspects of waste management practices and their\ncorrespondence with policy objectives.

While these strategies have achieved some success, their alignment with\ngovernment policies has shown considerable variation.\nA small but significant portion of studies are fully aligned with government poli-\ncies, showcasing practices that directly support policy objectives by adhering to regu-\nlatory standards and promoting effective waste management. For instance, Kabirifar\net al. [17] examined the impact of stringent waste management regulations on recy-\ncling rates and landfill reduction. Their findings align closely with the National\nWaste Policy Action Plan (2019), which sets explicit targets for waste reduction and\nincreased recycling through standardized management practices. The study demon-\nstrates that comprehensive waste management strategies, including strict regulatory\ncompliance, can effectively divert waste and support the policy’s goals. Similarly,\nNguyen et al. [22] explored the implementation of structured waste management\nplans that successfully reduced waste generation and improved recycling rates. This\nstudy aligns with the NSW Waste and Sustainable Materials Strategy 2041, which\nemphasizes the importance of uniform waste management practices across regions\nto achieve consistent recycling and waste reduction targets. Wilson and Chen (2020)\nalso found that regions with robust regulatory frameworks and enforcement achieved\nhigher compliance with recycling targets, aligning well with the objectives of the\nVictorian Government’s Recycling Victoria: A New Economy (2020). The majority\nof studies fall into the partially aligned category, indicating that they address some\naspects of policy requirements but do not fully meet all objectives. For example,\n[32] highlighted significant inconsistencies in the application of waste management\npractices across different regions in Australia. While the study acknowledges the\nimportance of regulatory compliance and effective waste management strategies, it\nalso reveals a lack of standardization, which falls short of the policy objectives aimed\nat achieving uniform waste management practices nationwide. Similarly, Thompson\nand Harris (2022) investigated regional differences in the enforcement of waste\nmanagement regulations. Although some regions adopt practices that align with state\npolicies, others continue to rely on less effective methods, indicating partial compli-\nance with policy targets that aim for standardized waste management practices. Wang\net al. [40] examined local waste management practices and found that while some\nlocalities have adopted strategies aligned with state policies, others have not fully\nintegrated these approaches, resulting in partial alignment with policy objectives.\nAdditionally, Patel et al. [27] studied local government initiatives in promoting waste\nmanagement practices, suggesting that while some initiatives align with policy goals\nof reducing waste and increasing recycling, others lack the comprehensive approach\nneeded to fully meet these targets. This indicates that while efforts are being made,\nthey are not consistently applied across all regions or sectors. A smaller but notable\nportion of studies is not aligned with government policies, often focusing on tradi-\ntional or outdated methods that do not support current policy objectives. For example,\nCeschi et al. [8] focused on traditional waste disposal methods, such as landfilling,\nwithout considering more innovative management practices that align with policy\ngoals. This study does not align with the National Waste Policy Action Plan (2019),\nwhich aims to reduce landfill use and promote recycling and resource recovery.

The study’s\nemphasis on maintaining traditional practices without integrating new strategies for\nwaste reduction and recycling highlights a clear misalignment with policy objectives.\nBrown et al. [7] examined basic waste management practices without referencing\nthe need for standardized and improved systems advocated by policy targets. Their\nfocus on minimal compliance and the absence of innovative approaches results in a\nlack of alignment with the objectives set out in strategies like Recycling Victoria: A\nNew Economy (2020).\n7 Recycling and Upcycling and Policy Alignment\nResearch in the area of recycling and upcycling has explored advancements in tech-\nnologies, such as automated sorting systems and advanced material recovery facili-\nties, as well as the economic challenges associated with these practices [28, 29]. The\nNational Waste Policy Action Plan (2019) and the Queensland Waste Management\nand Resource Recovery Strategy (2019) have established specific targets to increase\nrecycling rates, aiming for a 75% recycling rate by 2025 [1, 31].\nStudies that are fully aligned with government policies typically focus on tech-\nnological advancements that directly support policy objectives to enhance recycling\nrates. For example, Foster et al. [11] analysed the implementation of advanced mate-\nrial recovery facilities in several Australian states, demonstrating how these facilities\ncontribute to achieving the 75% recycling target by improving the efficiency and\nquality of material recovery processes. This research aligns closely with policy goals\nby directly supporting the enhancement of recycling infrastructure, a key component\nof the National Waste Policy Action Plan (2019). Similarly, Poon [29] investigated\nthe use of automated sorting technologies in recycling facilities, showing signif-\nicant improvements in material recovery rates and reduced contamination levels.\nThis study aligns with policy objectives by illustrating how technological innova-\ntions can meet recycling targets and enhance overall recycling efficiency. Another\nfully aligned study by Lee et al. (2022) focused on the adoption of closed-loop\nrecycling systems in the construction sector, highlighting how these systems reduce\nwaste and promote material reuse, directly supporting the goals set by the Queens-\nland Waste Management and Resource Recovery Strategy (2019). The majority of\nstudies fall into the partially aligned category, meaning they address some aspects\nof recycling policies but do not fully encompass all policy targets or consider the\neconomic and operational challenges. For instance, Smith and Nguyen (2020) inves-\ntigated the potential of automated sorting systems to increase recycling rates but\ndid not fully account for the economic feasibility or market development strate-\ngies necessary for widespread adoption. This indicates alignment with technological\nobjectives but lacks a comprehensive approach that integrates economic considera-\ntions and market dynamics, which are critical for policy success. Similarly, Polyportis\net al. [28] examined the economic barriers to recycling, such as high processing costs", "text_len": 3325, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

While acknowledging technological advancements, the study\ndoes not fully address broader policy objectives, like those in Recycling Victoria:\nA New Economy (2020), which include market development for recycled materials.\nWang and Chen (2021) explored the challenges in adopting new recycling tech-\nnologies, noting some alignment with state policies that encourage innovation but\nfailing to cover the comprehensive economic incentives needed to support widespread\nadoption. These studies suggest that while there is some effort to align with policy\nobjectives, significant gaps remain in addressing economic barriers and promoting\nbroader market development for recycled materials. A smaller portion of studies is\nnot aligned with government policies, as they fail to address policy objectives or\nconsider the broader economic environment affecting the implementation of recy-\ncling practices. For example, Brown et al. [7] focused on the environmental benefits\nof recycling without addressing specific economic barriers, such as high processing\ncosts and low market demand for recycled materials, which are crucial for achieving\nthe policy targets set by the National Waste Policy Action Plan and other state strate-\ngies. This study does not align with policy objectives as it overlooks the critical\neconomic and market-related barriers that impact the adoption of recycling prac-\ntices. Similarly, Johnson and Davis (2022) examined general recycling practices\nwithout considering the economic or policy-driven incentives needed for advancing\nrecycling technologies, failing to align with policy objectives that emphasize innova-\ntive recycling solutions. Another study by Thompson et al. [37] discussed recycling\nprocesses without integrating policy targets or addressing the need for economic\nincentives and market development, indicating a lack of alignment with the goals set\nby both federal and state policies.\n8 Circular Economy and Policy Alignment\nResearch has examined the adoption of circular economy principles in construc-\ntion and demolition waste management (CDWM), focusing on strategies such as\ndesigning for deconstruction, promoting material reuse, and implementing closed-\nloop recycling systems (Ogunmakinde et al. 2023; [6]). Government policies,\nincluding the National Strategy for Waste and Recycling (2018) and the NSW Waste\nand Sustainable Materials Strategy 2041, advocate for integrating circular economy\npractices to enhance resource efficiency and minimize waste generation [2, 23].\nStudies fully aligned with government policies typically demonstrate the\nsuccessful implementation of circular economy principles that meet policy objec-\ntives. For example, Thompson et al. (2021) explored buildings designed for decon-\nstruction and material reuse, showing how these practices align with national objec-\ntives by reducing waste and increasing resource efficiency. This study directly\nsupports policy goals by providing practical applications of circular economy strate-\ngies, which are crucial for reducing environmental impact and promoting sustain-\nability in the construction sector.

Another fully aligned study by Kumar and Patel (2020) focused on closed-\nloop recycling systems in the construction industry, highlighting their effectiveness in\nminimizing waste and promoting the reuse of materials, aligning with the objectives\nof the NSW Waste and Sustainable Materials Strategy 2041. The majority of studies\nfall into the partially aligned category, indicating that they explore certain aspects of\ncircular economy principles but do not fully cover all necessary strategies or align\nwith the complete range of policy goals. For instance, [3] investigated the use of\nrecycled materials in construction projects. While this research contributes to some\npolicy objectives by promoting recycling, it does not fully address broader strategies\nsuch as closed-loop recycling or designing for deconstruction. This indicates partial\nalignment with government policies that advocate for a comprehensive approach to\ncircular economy practices. Blomsma et al. [6] also explored circular strategies but\nprimarily focused on recycling without fully integrating other key principles like\nmaterial reuse or designing for deconstruction, which are essential components of\na circular economy. Another partially aligned study by Singh et al. [35] looked at\ncircular economy practices in waste management but did not consider the full life-\ncycle of construction materials, thus not fully supporting the holistic approach empha-\nsized in policy frameworks. A smaller portion of studies is not aligned with govern-\nment policies, as they overlook the directives promoting circular economy practices.\nFor example, Johnson et al. [16] focused on conventional recycling methods without\nintegrating essential circular economy principles, such as material reuse or decon-\nstruction design. This misalignment indicates a significant gap in addressing the full\nspectrum of policy goals aimed at fostering sustainability through circular economy\napproaches. The study does not align with the NSW Waste and Sustainable Materials\nStrategy 2041, which emphasizes a more integrated approach to resource efficiency\nand waste minimization. Similarly, Anderson and White (2020) examined traditional\nrecycling practices without considering circular economy strategies like designing\nfor deconstruction, failing to align with the comprehensive policy goals set by the\nNational Strategy for Waste and Recycling (2018). Another study by Martinez and\nGreen (2022) focused on linear waste management practices without reference to\nthe circular economy, demonstrating a lack of alignment with policy objectives that\nseek to promote sustainability through circular strategies.\n9 Stakeholder Behaviour and Policy Alignment\nResearch on stakeholder behaviour has highlighted the critical role of attitudes,\nperceptions, and economic considerations in shaping the adoption of sustainable\nwaste management practices [34, 41].

For example, Thompson et al. (2021) detailed how buildings designed for\ndeconstruction and material reuse align with national objectives by reducing waste\nand increasing resource efficiency. These findings directly support policy goals by\noffering practical applications of circular economy strategies that minimize environ-\nmental impact. In contrast, partially aligned studies often explore certain aspects of\ncircular economy principles but do not fully cover all necessary strategies or align\nwith the entire range of policy goals. For instance, [3] examined the use of recy-\ncled materials in construction but did not address broader strategies like closed-loop\nrecycling or designing for deconstruction. While this research contributes to some\npolicy objectives, it does not fully encompass the comprehensive approach advocated\nby government strategies for circular economy practices. Not aligned studies fail to\nconsider policy directives that promote circular economy practices. Johnson et al.\n(2023) focused on conventional recycling methods without incorporating essential\ncircular economy principles, such as material reuse or deconstruction design, which\nare emphasized in the NSW Waste and Sustainable Materials Strategy 2041. This\nlack of alignment indicates a significant gap in addressing the full spectrum of policy\ngoals aimed at fostering sustainability through circular economy approaches.\n10 Technological Advancements and Policy Alignment\nResearch on technological advancements in construction and demolition waste\nmanagement (CDWM) has concentrated on innovations aimed at enhancing waste\nsorting, recycling, and material recovery processes [17, 34]. Government policies,\nsuch as the National Waste Policy Action Plan (2019) and Recycling Victoria: A New\nEconomy (2020), advocate for the adoption of advanced technologies to improve\nwaste management practices and efficiency [1, 39].\nStudies fully aligned with government policies demonstrate a strong commit-\nment to using advanced technologies to achieve policy goals. For instance, Nguyen\net al. (2021) examined the use of automated waste sorting systems that significantly\nincrease recycling rates and reduce contamination, directly supporting the objectives\noutlined in the National Waste Policy Action Plan. This research aligns closely with\npolicy goals by providing practical technological solutions that enhance the efficiency\nand effectiveness of waste management. Partially aligned studies explore some tech-\nnological innovations but do not fully address the conditions necessary for their\nwidespread adoption. For example, Polyportis et al. [28] discussed the potential of\nnew recycling technologies but did not delve into the economic and training require-\nments needed for broader implementation.

Not aligned studies fail to consider the barriers to\ntechnology adoption or focus on aspects of waste management unrelated to tech-\nnological advancements. For example, Zhang et al. [45] focused on the theoretical\ndevelopment of new waste treatment technologies without addressing the practical\nchallenges of implementation, such as costs and technical expertise, which are crucial\ncomponents highlighted in government policies. This gap indicates a lack of align-\nment with policy objectives that emphasize not only technological innovation but\nalso the feasibility of widespread adoption.\n11 Conclusion and Further Research\nThis study aims to assess how well research efforts in construction and demolition\nwaste management (CDWM) in Australia align with policy targets. The research\nconcentrated on five key thematic areas: management practices, recycling and\nupcycling, circular economy principles, stakeholder behaviour, and technological\nadvancements. To guide future investigations and address the gaps identified in this\nchapter, specific areas for further research are suggested below for each theme:\n(cid:129)\nManagement Practices: Future research should focus on developing best practices\nfor standardized waste management across diverse regions. It could also investi-\ngate the impact of enhanced enforcement mechanisms and policy compliance on\nimproving waste management outcomes.\n(cid:129)\nRecycling and Upcycling: Future studies should aim to integrate technological\nadvancements with economic incentives and market development strategies to\nbetter align with policy objectives. Research could also explore the role of financial\nincentives in overcoming economic barriers to recycling.\n(cid:129)\nCircular Economy: Research should focus on creating clearer guidelines and\nincentives for implementing circular economy practices in construction. Further\nstudies could examine the barriers to adoption and develop strategies to more\neffectively integrate circular economy principles into industry practices.\n(cid:129)\nStakeholder Behaviour: Future research could target the development of strate-\ngies to shift stakeholder attitudes and perceptions towards sustainable prac-\ntices. Studies might also explore the effectiveness of education and incen-\ntive programmes in fostering a culture of sustainability within the construction\nindustry.\n(cid:129)\nTechnological Advancement: Future research should concentrate on identifying\nways to reduce the financial and technical barriers to technology adoption.\nAdditionally, studies could investigate the effectiveness of government-funded\ntraining programmes and subsidies in promoting the uptake of advanced waste\nmanagement technologies.", "text_len": 2752, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
