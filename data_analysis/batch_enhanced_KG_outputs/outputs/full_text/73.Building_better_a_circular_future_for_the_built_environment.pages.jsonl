The publication focuses on the building industry and its current environmental impact and explores how\napplying circular principles can help solve these pressing challenges in a resource-constrained world.

However, the building industry has a very large environmental footprint due to its historically energy inefficient\ndesign, the embodied energy of building materials and the ongoing impact of their use. Buildings alone represent nearly half of the\nworld’s construction sector and contribute around 38% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. As noted in the report, buildings\nare also responsible for half of all extracted materials, half of the total energy consumption, one-third of water consumption and\none-third of waste generation globally. The magnitude of this impact will only keep growing without significant change in the\nindustry.\n\nWith rapidly increasing pressures such as population growth, high demand for materials, migration of people into urban areas and\nthe upsurge in energy consumption, the building industry is facing challenges that must be addressed immediately. However, there\nis still potential to transform and futureproof this sector.\n\nThe circular building economy is the way forward\n\nThe circular economy and its principles offer new opportunities with the potential to address the industry’s environmental footprint\nacross all stages of the supply chain. This includes the design and development stage, operational stages as well as the end-of-life\nof buildings.\n\nDuring the initial phase, principles such as using circular design strategies to build structures that can be dismantled and\nrepurposed after the building’s lifespan can help reduce the building’s footprint. This can be further supplemented by using bio-\nbased and renewable materials as opposed to virgin resources. Once built, a proper asset management procedure must be put in\nplace to ensure materials and products within the building are regularly maintained and renovated to extend their lifespan for as\nlong as possible. At the end of a building’s lifespan, methods such as recycling and reusing resources will be critical to reducing\nconstruction and demolition material waste, which could instead be used again as secondary raw materials for new structures.\n\nThe report also recommends other techniques such as material passports to track the journey of products across their lifecycle,\nproduct-as-service models and circularity measurement tools to ensure high-quality reuse and assist in making informed decisions\nalong the way.\n\nBest practices and innovations from a Dutch context\n\nThe Netherlands has always been a front runner when it comes to implementing circular economy principles. Their need for ever-\nemerging technology and constant circular innovation has been driven by the region’s challenging terrain and scarcity of natural\nresources. However, the Dutch have shown development that is within planetary boundaries and in alignment with nature is both\npossible and hugely beneficial for their domestic economy.\n\nThe report provides case studies of successful dutch companies that exhibit best practices and are making an impact in the\nbuilding sector. These have been distributed into 9 categories: i) circular policies, ii) circular procurement, ii) measuring circularity,\niv) circular design strategies, v) technical and material innovations, vi) business models, vii) material passports and data strategy,\nviii) circular marketplaces and ix) supply chain collaborations.\n\nWe cannot achieve circularity alone\n\nAs stated by the World Resource Institute, cities are expected to contribute nearly three-quarters of our world’s energy use by\n2030. Given how much time we spend living, working and conducting activities within buildings this is not entirely surprising.\nHowever, if we are to reach our climate and emissions targets, we cannot do it without addressing both how we construct buildings\nand how we operate inside them.\n\f", "text_len": 4191, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Therefore, tangible change in this sector can only be achieved by taking a systems approach that is both cross-\nborder and cross-sector.\n\nThe report ultimately lists three main recommendations as part of an action plan to make our buildings circular:\n\n1. We must go circular together by building partnerships that go beyond regional, national and international boundaries.\n\n2. We must develop a standardised set of frameworks for climate-neutral and circular infrastructure to enable the construction\nsector to become more sustainable. We must also form ‘coalitions of the willing’ consisting of working groups to create these\nframeworks, as well as ‘coalitions of the doing’ to take immediate action and adopt cutting-edge practices.\n\n3. We must integrate circular economy actions across other policies and plans like the Climate and Energy and Sustainability\nrelated actions.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of how we can transform the buildings industry toward a circular future, read the Circular Buildings:\nconstructing a sustainable future report.\n\nSHARE\n\f", "text_len": 1331, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
