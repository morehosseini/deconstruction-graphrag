The report also\nassesses the state’s progress against the targets set out in the Government of\nWestern Australia’s Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery Strategy 2030\n(waste strategy).\nUnder regulation 18C of the Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery\nRegulations 2008 (WARR Regulations), liable persons are required to lodge\nannual returns containing waste and recycling data to the Department of\nWater and Environmental Regulation (the department). The data in this report\nwas predominantly derived from annual returns lodged by 254 liable persons\nfor the 2021–22 reporting period, including local governments, recyclers and\nnon‑metropolitan landfills. Other data sources are detailed in the methodology\n(Appendix A).\nOnly solid waste is required to be reported under the WARR Regulations. Most\nmining, agricultural and forestry wastes are excluded from this report.\nThis report is the third report in the series. The latest reports replace two\nlong‑running series of reports published by the Waste Authority prior to\n2019–20: Recycling activity in Western Australia and The census of Western\nAustralian local government waste and recycling services. In previous years,\nrecyclers and local governments voluntarily supplied data for these reports.\nThe reporting requirements under the WARR Regulations, introduced in 2019,\nprovide for a more complete dataset compared with previous years under the\nvoluntary reporting scheme.\nData published in the report is also dynamically presented in Power BI reports\navailable on the Waste Authority’s website.\nWaste and recycling in Western Australia 2021–22 5", "text_len": 1748, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
