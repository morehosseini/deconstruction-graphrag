{"source_file": "16.What-we-heard-report-Building-and-Construction-Industry.pdf", "page_num": 2, "text": "Consultation purpose\nLaunched in 2022, Skilled to Succeed is the ACT Government’s skills and workforce agenda that\nstrives to ensure Canberrans have the right skills for in-demand jobs now and into the future. This\nagenda focuses on four priorities:\n• Delivering skills inclusively to provide all Canberrans a foundation for lifelong learning\n• Build a more responsive, flexible, and future-focussed skills system\n• Assisting employers to build, attract and retain the right workforce\n• Strengthening skills sector foundations\nTo deliver this agenda, the ACT Government is developing Industry Plans for the Care, Technology,\nBuilding & Construction, Experience, and Renewables & Sustainability sectors. These Plans will\nidentify actions for government, industry, and training providers to ensure that the training and skills\nsystem supports Canberra’s future workforce.\nTo underpin the development of these plans, the ACT Government has been hosting roundtables\nwith industry stakeholders to hear their views on how the skills sector can support the growth of\ntheir industry and develop the workforce that they need going into the future.\nOn 5 December 2022, the Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate hosted\nan ACT Building & Construction Roundtable with peak bodies, industry associations, training\nproviders, unions, and employers of apprentices. A list of those who attended the Roundtable is\nprovided at Attachment C.\nYellow Edge, a Canberra-based leadership and performance development company was engaged by\nthe ACT Government to facilitate the Roundtable and prepare the following Listening Report. This\npaper captures the key themes and perspectives of attendees.\nWhat we heard\nParticipants from across the Building and Construction (B&C) industry had a robust discussion on the\nopportunities and challenges facing the sector and ideas on addressing the issues. The views\nrecorded in this report were captured from participants on the day.\nFour key themes emerged over the course of the discussion. They included:\n1. Role of VET to support the changing needs of industry.\n2. The changing landscape of apprenticeships.\n3. Workplace flexibility and work-life balance.\n4. Rising competition for skills and changing worker expectations.\nThese themes are interconnected and together provide a picture of what the industry is currently\nexperiencing as well as opportunities for improvement in the future.\n1", "text_len": 2432, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "16.What-we-heard-report-Building-and-Construction-Industry.pdf", "page_num": 3, "text": "What are the opportunities and challenges for the building and\nconstruction workforce now and into the future?\nTheme 1: Role of VET to support the changing needs of industry\n• Innovative technologies for the design and construction of commercial and residential builds.\nThis encapsulates:\no greener building design, new materials, new construction methods,\no building information, and\no building performance monitoring.\n• The rapid emergence of these technologies can be attributed to supply chain bottlenecks, but\nalso in response to extreme weather events such as floods and bushfires. There is also a demand\nfor climate change-resilient housing and buildings constructed with a lower environmental\nfootprint.\n• With sufficient funding and resource procurement, the Vocational Education and Training (VET)\nsector in the ACT can begin future-proofing training in the building and construction industry,\nensuring workforce capability and readiness to match increasing demands. This would require a\njoint effort between the VET sector and ACT Government. The government should provide\nsufficient funding, and policy must be paired with skills/implementation (e.g., European Union\nstrategy). Model projects can be used by the industry to highlight technology. Regular reviews of\nthe VET sector will also ensure teaching capability and Canberra Institute of Technology is held\nto a high standard.\n• While the ACT is already leading and innovating in the green building space in some areas of the\nindustry (e.g., HVAC), there is always room to develop sustainable opportunities. The VET sector\ncan play a crucial role in contributing to the ACT’s potential of being a leader in Green Building.\nThe administration of quick and flexible training packages will equip the workforce with the skills\nand knowledge to maintain greener practices. A digital design pathway is needed in between\nVET drafting and architecture, which in turn will help standardise the approach to scope three\nemission standards/sustainability.\n• Coordination with industries and universities can be fruitful for anticipating emerging skill areas\nand technology. It is important the VET sector have this foresight to avoid “playing catch-up.”\nTheme 2: The changing landscape of apprenticeships\n• Apprenticeships are a common feature of the skill building pipeline within the industry.\nHowever, as young people’s expectations change and demand for all forms of talent continues\nto increase, apprenticeships as a career pathway, face an increasingly competitive environment.\nBuilding greater support systems for young apprentices has been identified as a positive strategy\nto improve well-being and realise better completion rates.\n• Young apprentices are facing more problems than ever when starting or continuing their\napprenticeships in the ACT. This is in part due to the impact of COVID on young people, causing a\ngreat level of disconnect and shifting the work-life balance. Other problems that may impact on\napprenticeships include:\no Parental engagement.\no Changing perceptions about university versus trades.\no Funding white card / personal protective equipment / basic clothing and equipment kits.\no Finding work with a purpose.\no Limited work experience.\n2", "text_len": 3231, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "16.What-we-heard-report-Building-and-Construction-Industry.pdf", "page_num": 4, "text": "• By providing greater support, infrastructure, and training facilities, we (industry) may see\nincreased rates of completion in apprenticeships. Peer-to-peer career talks about pathways can\nalso offer apprentices clarity, advice, and motivation. Finally, increases in cost of living may force\nsome apprentices to seek more sustainable work opportunities. Wrap-around support (e.g.,\nchildcare support, flexibility) and rotations of employers (via a Government Training\nOrganisation) can also help apprentices struggling to balance their work-life relationship. Current\nmeasures include the ‘Try-A-Trade’ program, and growing flexibility within courses.\n• Completion rates could be improved through introducing trade licensing in the ACT.\nTheme 3: Workplace flexibility and work-life balance.\n• The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employee expectations towards their work-life\nbalance has accelerated the need across all sectors to strengthen efforts to building positive,\ninclusive, and flexible organisational cultures to support good mental health outcomes,\nemployee engagement, retention, productivity, and access to talent—which may be dispersed\ngeographically.\n• System flexibility for people who are struggling to meet conventional training and education\nregimen can yield positive returns for the industry if implemented appropriately. These include:\no Opportunities for theory training delivered online (in a workshop environment).\no Flexible timeframes to complete courses.\no Digital hubs that provide access to the technology required to complete courses.\no Technology training for mature learners / digitally illiterate etc.\no Registered Training Organisations should also have greater flexibility in relation to course\nand assessment scheduling including delivering training online.\n• Measures should also be taken to make training and employment more accessible to\nunderrepresented groups or those with special circumstances. For example, pre-apprenticeship\nprograms can be very successful for providing entry level training for women, helping them get\ninto the industry.\nTheme 4: Rising competition for skills and changing worker expectations.\n• As attitudes of people to their work lives change and evolve, portfolio careers are becoming\nincreasingly common. People with a broad mix of work experiences and capabilities seek more\nvariety, the opportunity to build on their acquired skills and to have new career experiences in\nnew areas of work, including in the industry.\n• The range of qualifications and experience in the industry will only be further exacerbated by\npost-pandemic migration to Australia. Given the pent-up demand for talent across many sectors,\nit is expected that competition for skills and the expectation workers will have for their pre-\nexisting experiences and capabilities to be adapted, broadened, and accepted by industry, will\nincrease substantially.\n• While recognition of prior learning can contribute to bolstering the supply of skills of those\nstarting or upskilling in the industry, they first need to know which skills are transferable. For\nexample, the Washington Accord allows for skills transfer within Engineering Courses. Some\nother suggestions to bolster the supply of skills include:\no Building a pipeline of school leavers.\n3", "text_len": 3285, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Roundtable scenarios\nScenario 1\nInnovative technologies for the design and construction of commercial and residential builds (such\nas green building design, new materials, new construction methods, building information modelling,\nand building performance monitoring) are quickly emerging.\nIn some instances, these have been driven by supply chain bottlenecks, but also in response to\nextreme weather events such as catastrophic floods and bushfires. Residents, insurance companies,\nlocal governments, and emergency service organisations are also demanding climate change-\nresilient housing and buildings with a lower environmental footprint.\nDiscussion points:\n• How could the VET sector in ACT future-proof training in the building and construction industry\nand seek to ensure workforce capability and readiness as demand grows?\n• Does the ACT have the potential to be a leader in Green Building? What contribution can the VET\nsector make to realise this?\n• In what ways are/will these future and emerging skills areas be recognised within or outside of\ntraditional trades’ categories?\n• How can the VET sector anticipate new skills areas as a result of emerging technology and avoid\nbeing in “catch-up” mode?\nScenario 2\nApprenticeships have generally been a common feature of skill building and the development of a\nskills pipeline within the Building and Construction industry. However, as young people’s\nexpectations change and demand for all forms of talent continues to increase, apprenticeships as a\ncareer pathway face an increasingly competitive environment.\nBuilding greater support for young apprentices has been identified as a positive strategy to improve\nwell-being and realise better completion rates. This “wrap-around support” in some industries\nincludes accommodation, ‘local buddies,’ and integration assistance for interstate and overseas\nstudents, career planning advice, industry internships, professional mentoring, and overseas\nscholarships.\nDiscussion points:\n• What particular challenges might a young person face starting and continuing their\napprenticeship in the ACT?\n• What factors have been impacting low completion in apprentice training?\n• What approaches could help turn this around in the future?\n• What current strategies exist and what potential approaches could be employed in the future to\nimprove participation for women and other under-represented groups?\nScenario 3\nThe impact of the COVID pandemic on employee expectations towards their work-life has\naccelerated the need across all sectors to strengthen efforts to building positive, inclusive, and\nflexible organisational cultures to support good mental health outcomes, employee engagement,\nretention, productivity, and access to talent-- which may be dispersed geographically.\n4", "text_len": 2789, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "16.What-we-heard-report-Building-and-Construction-Industry.pdf", "page_num": 12, "text": "This has also resulted in more system-wide flexibilities including greater respect for diversity and the\ninclusion of people from underrepresented groups, greater deployment of virtual service delivery\n(such as tele-medicine), greater acceptance of virtual degree programs, alternative sources of goods\nand supply within the global supply chain, and access to external, specialised just-in-time expertise\nwhich may be located across geographical boundaries.\nDiscussion points:\n• How can the system work better in the future for people who need flexibility in when and how\nthey participate in training and education or over what period they are able to complete their\nstudies?\n• Can the approach taken by some universities be adapted to our VET offerings?\n• What changes need to happen for entering the industry and for current staff upskilling to quickly\nand properly gain recognition for their experience and training?\n• How could future training and employment be more accessible to those in underrepresented\ngroups or those with special circumstances?\nScenario 4\nAs attitudes of people to their work lives change and evolve, portfolio careers are becoming\nincreasingly common. People with a broad mix of work experiences and capabilities seek more\nvariety, the opportunity to build on their acquired skills and to have new career experiences in new\nareas of work, including in the Building and Construction sector.\nPost-pandemic migration to Australia is expected to rise and will potentially bring a broad range of\nqualifications and experiences which may be relevant to the Building and Construction sector in the\nACT. Given the pent-up demand for talent across many sectors, it is expected that competition for\nskills and the expectation workers will have that their pre-existing experiences and capabilities can\nbe adapted, broadened, and accepted by industry will increase substantially.\nDiscussion points:\n• For the building and construction industry, what part can RPL play in future years in bolstering\nthe supply of skills of those starting in the industry or those upskilling or broadening their skills\nand qualifications mix?\n• What alternative ways could be developed to acknowledge and tap into the prior experience,\ncapabilities, and qualifications of people so that their potential is not lost?\n• What capability pathways could be developed to bring mid-career people, migrants, and\nunderrepresented groups into the Building and Construction sector as part of ensuring a vibrant\ntalent pipeline?\n5", "text_len": 2515, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
