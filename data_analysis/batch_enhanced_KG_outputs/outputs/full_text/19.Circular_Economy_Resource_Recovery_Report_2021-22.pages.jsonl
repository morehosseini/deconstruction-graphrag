The strategy defines waste\ndiversion and reduction targets to 2025, which are guided by an overall target of zero avoidable waste to\nlandfill by 2030. This section details SA’s progress in achieving these targets.\nLandfill diversion target\nSouth Australia’s Waste Strategy 2020-25 sets out a goal for zero avoidable waste to landfill by 2030. The State\ndisposed about 885,000 tonnes of waste to landfill in 2021-22, an increase from 840,000 tonnes in 2020 21. A\nrange of actions will need to be implemented to achieve SA’s ambitious landfill target for 2030.\nSA came close to meeting the 2020 target for reducing waste to landfill by 35% from a 2002-03 baseline, but\nincreases in landfill in 2021-22 resulted in a lower reduction of 27% against the 2002-03 levels.\nFigure 10 Landfill disposal trend since 2002-03, including state targets for 2020 and 2030\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\nAll other waste Contaminated soils\n)sennot\nfo\nsnoillim(\nlasopsid\nllifdnaL\nllifdnal\not\netsaw\nelbadiova\noreZ\nWaste generation target\nSouth Australia’s Waste Strategy 2020-25 sets a target of 5% reduction in waste generation per capita from a\n2020 baseline. Table 7 summarises a five-year trend in waste generation per capita for all reported materials.\nWaste generation per capita decreased by 165 kilograms (5.8%) in 2021-22 compared to the previous year, and\nan overall reduction of 4.3% since the period 2019-20.\nTable 7 Waste generation per capita since 2017-18, including the state target for 2025\nChange (%) Target\nRecovery type 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 20-21 to 21-22 2025\nWaste generation per capita 3,090 2,960 2,800 2,844 2,679 -5.8% 5% reduction\n(kg/person/yr) from 2020\nbaseline\nMetropolitan diversion target\nThe State is moving towards its 2023 goals of 65% diversion for MSW, 85% diversion for C&I, and 90% diversion\nfor C&D. Table 8 presents the diversion rate achieved in metropolitan SA in 2021-22, together with State targets\nfor 2023 and 2025.\nIn 2021-22, the C&I recovery rate was 88.2%, above the 2023 target of 85% and close to the diversion target of\n90% by 2025. The C&D source stream recovery rate was 87.2%, just shy of the target of 90% for 2023. The MSW\nrecovery rate was 55.9%, slightly lower than the previously held recovery rate of 56.1% in 2020-21. There is\nsignificant room for improvement for municipal stream to achieve state targets.\nTable 8 Metropolitan diversion rate for SA in 2021-22, including state targets to 2025\n2021-22 Metropolitan diversion target\ndiversion rate\nSource sector 2023 2025\nMSW 55.9% 65% 75%\nC&I 88.2% 85% 90%\n2 0 02- 0 3 2 0 0 3- 0 4 2 0 0 4- 0 5 2 0 0 5- 0 6 2 0 0 6- 07 2 0 07- 0 8 2 0 0 8- 0 9 2 0 0 9-1 0 2 01 0-11 2 011-12 2 012-1 3 2 01 3-1 4 2 01 4-1 5 2 01 5-1 6 2 01 6-17 2 017-1 8 2 01 8-1 9 2 01 9-2 0 2 02 0-21 2 021-2 0 2 2 0 Tar g e 0 3 t 0 Tar g et C&D 87.2% 90% 95%\n2 2\nCIRCULAR ECONOMY RESOURCE RECOVERY REPORT 2021-22 CIRCULAR ECONOMY RESOURCE RECOVERY REPORT 2021-22\n23 24\nCIRCuLAR ECOnOMy RESOuRCE RECOVERy STATISTICS CIRCuLAR ECOnOMy RESOuRCE RECOVERy STATISTICS\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  |  |  |  |  | Change (%) | Target\nRecovery type | 2017-18 | 2018-19 | 2019-20 | 2020-21 | 2021-22 | 20-21 to 21-22 | 2025\nWaste generation per capita\n(kg/person/yr) | 3,090 | 2,960 | 2,800 | 2,844 | 2,679 | -5.8% | 5% reduction\nfrom 2020\nbaseline\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | llifdnal\not\ne\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | tsaw\nelbad\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | iova\noreZ\n | 2021-22\ndiversion rate | Metropolitan diversion target | \nSource sector |  | 2023 | 2025\nMSW | 55.9% | 65% | 75%\nC&I | 88.2% | 85% | 90%\nC&D | 87.2% | 90% | 95%\nCIRCULAR ECONOMY RESOURCE RECOVERY REPORT 2021-22\n23\nCIRCuLAR ECOnOMy RESOuRCE RECOVERy STATISTICS | CIRCULAR ECONOMY RESOURCE RECOVERY REPORT 2021-22\n24\nCIRCuLAR ECOnOMy RESOuRCE RECOVERy STATISTICS", "text_len": 6110, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The practice promotes the cycling of material without\nthe need to consume new resources. There is a longstanding reuse network that includes its charities, non-\ngovernment organisations (e.g. food rescue organisations), community groups and online trading platforms\n(e.g. Gumtree). Items and products commonly recirculated via the reuse economy include clothing, food,\nhome furniture, whitegoods, vehicles and electronics.\nMRA (2021) found that each year, Australians divert about 310,000 tonnes of clothing for reuse to charitable\norganisations nationally. Almost 10% of this is attributed to South Australians. Reusing clothes instead of\nlandfilling them can reduce carbon emissions by 66%, water consumption by 57% and energy use by 59%.\nReused clothing also generates an estimated revenue of $1,700 per tonne.\nKey players in SA’s charitable network reported quantities from 2021-22 which are shown in Table 14, together\nwith estimated values for the reuse materials.

The following pilot traces the system of plastic flows within SA.\nPlastics consumption in SA in 2021-22 was estimated at 239,000 tonnes. It is estimated that locally manufactured\nand imported plastics comprised about 9% recycled content.\nStocks of plastics in use were estimated at about 1,600,000 tonnes. Most consumed plastics arise in short\nlived applications like packaging, but significant quantities of plastics have accumulated over time in the\nbuilt environment and in long-lasting consumer products. It is estimated that about 190,000 tonnes of plastics\nreached end of life in SA in 2021-22. As described in Section 3.8, about 33,000 tonnes of these were recovered.\nThis equates to an estimated recovery rate of 18%.\nIt is estimated that about 82% of end-of-life plastics were sent to landfills in SA in 2021-22, which now contain at\nleast 3.8 million tonnes of plastics.\nEstimated plastics flows in SA in 2021-22 are depicted below.
