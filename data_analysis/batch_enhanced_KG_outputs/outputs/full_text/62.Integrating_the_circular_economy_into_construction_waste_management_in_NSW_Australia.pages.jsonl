The complexity creates a unique\nchallenge when considering the transition towards circular economy practices, as one\nprocess can involve multiple variables and actors that considerably impact the outcome.\nApproaches that embrace the circular economy through the supply and demand chain of\nthe construction industry permeate through construction waste management. This study\naims at understanding how circular economy principles are currently practiced through\npolicy implementation and industry practices. It identifies critical challenges and\nopportunities in the transition toward circularity in construction waste management.\nUsing a case study of the construction industry in NSW, Australia, this project aims to\nunderstand how current policies support the inclusion of circular practices and to explore\nthe influence level of different actors’ practices. A policy review and semi-structured\ninterviews were used as methods to identify the relevant policies and industry practices\nthat promote circular economy principles, including any appointed responsibility to the\nactors involved in the construction industry.\nThe research found that current policies lack congruency, clarity, and legislative power to\npromote circular economy practices or appoint responsibilities to any construction waste\nmanagement industry participant. Moreover, the interchangeable use of sustainable and\ncircular economy practices creates a challenge in the transition as the practices are not\nfully developed or understood under one paradigm. On the contrary, practices are being\ncarved to fit either. Finally, the research finds considerable potential to integrate the\ncircular economy into the construction waste management industry by transitioning actors\nto enablers of circular practices throughout the multiple stages of construction and\ndevelopment of projects.\n2", "text_len": 2002, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Introduction\nAustralia had a major wake-up call in 2017 when China announced the ‘ban’ on imported\nwaste proceeding from the country, throwing the waste industry into a challenging period,\nas an oversupply of recycled materials tanked prices making the industry rethink their\ncurrent practices (Phil Kasker, 2017; Downes, 2018). This prompted the government to\ncreate incentives within the sector, integrating circular economy principles that can\nprocess and self-sustain the industry adapting to the increasing supply and new\nchallenges. As Australia pursues high-speed economic development, the construction\nindustry follows a projected growth rate of 2.4% p.a. (Anon, 2022), and as the industry\ngrows, the waste produced increases with it. Construction waste represents 16.8% of all\nthe waste produced in Australia, and it has increased by 22%, translating into a $2 Billion\nexpense in the construction industry on waste services between the last quarter of 2017\nand 2019 (ABS, 2018-19).\nCircular economy (CE) practices can potentially improve industry practices and reduce\nthe environmental impact created by construction activities (Gheewala & Silalertruksa,\n2020). Recycling, up-cycling, and re-using materials such as concrete, steel, wood, or\nplasterboard reduce the amount of required raw material for the manufacturing processes\nwhile reducing the amount of waste disposed of in landfills. The importance of\ntransitioning towards a circular economy in the construction waste industry is based on\nthe parallel integration of the social, environmental, and financial benefits distributing the\nresponsibilities amongst all the actors and stakeholders involved in the construction\nindustry.\nThis research aims to identify the challenges and opportunities outlined previously and\nintegrate them with the professional experience of key participants in the construction\nindustry, seeking to understand how ingrained the circular economy is in their practices.\nAlthough the existing knowledge around construction waste management identifies\nchallenges and opportunities, it lacks empirical analysis, which impedes the process of\nconsideration for key stakeholders in the construction industry (CI), such as builders,\narchitects, and engineers. Moreover, the research aims to change the positionality of\nactors to enablers of circularity, which is critical to implementing circular practices in the\nconstruction waste management (CWM) industry. Therefore, the research focuses on the\nday-to-day circular operations and potentialities explained by professionals involved in\n8", "text_len": 2578, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Literature Review\nThe literature review aims to identify the definitions, challenges, and opportunities\nidentified in the existing literature of circular economy applied to the construction and\nconstruction waste management industry. At the same time, the literature review\nanalyses the circular economy practices proposed by the literature understanding the\npotentials and challenges in the construction industry considering the multiple actors and\nfactors involved in any project. Finally, the review aims to identify key literature\ndifferentiating sustainability from the circular economy, as the current practices in the\nconstruction industry are more often identified as sustainable practices blurring the lines\nbetween the two concepts, which represents a risk in the transition toward circular\neconomy practices in the construction waste management industry.\n2.1 Overview of construction waste management systems\nThe construction industry represents 9% of Australia’s GDP and contributes to the\ncountry's manufacturing, transport, and many other key industries. The growth rate of\nexploitation of resources and waste disposal is directly related to the construction\nindustry. Recently, the demand for materials and resources for the delivery of construction\nprojects had an impact due to events such as the global pandemic of 2019 (Anon., 2022)\nand the war between Russia and Ukraine (Walters & Badshah, 2022). Materials and\nresources have increased prices, lead times, availability, and even quality, resulting in\nadditional pressure on the industry. The latter situation has prompted conversations\naround alternative practices that can alleviate the current pressures.\nThe construction waste management systems use a linear approach in the current\nprocesses. Waste is continuously squandered in the construction industry as resources\nare not accounted for nor appropriately documented. The responsibility to sort,\ncategorize, recycle, or upcycle is transferred to waste management organizations that\ncollect the waste on-site. One of the challenges is maintaining a live database that allows\nactors to access material data specifics and stock availability information that can be\nreadily distributed across existing projects (Rose & Stegemann, 2018).\n10", "text_len": 2265, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The ability to maintain real-time information on\nthe available members of a building to upcycle through new technology created a ripple\neffect in traditional practices (Gheewala & Silalertruksa, 2020) as it uses the resources at\nleast twice.\nThe use of concepts such as close-loop processes and upcycling resources (Gheewala\n& Silalertruksa, 2020) provides a material flow that is organic and dynamic, allowing the\nsame resources to participate in multiple production chains throughout its life cycle,\nextending the life and increasing the capitalization capacities of the resources breaking\nthe linear manufacturing and production practices.\nThese multi-collaborative relations between the construction stakeholders that can be\ncreated with the use of new practices change the relationships between the construction\nwaste with the stakeholder as it has the potential to create financial benefits to the parties\ninvolved while still having the benefit of reducing the number of resources required and\ndisposed of material. The economic benefits of circular economy practices have been\npreviously studied, which argued that the financial viability of construction waste\nmanagement feasibility depends on location, context, and social and economic factors\n(Ghisellini, et al., 2018). This shows the potential for future research around the\ninteraction of the literature to the practical application of on-site practices that apply to\nmultiple projects understood from the positionality of key stakeholders.\n2.2 Concepts in Construction Waste Management\n2.2.1 The circular economy\nThe circular economy's primary objective has been described as to regenerate the\nresources cycles, i.e., to maintain the material value at each point of its life cycle,\nminimizing the exploitation of resources, and reducing the generation of waste to close\nthe loop of materials cycles through high-value recycling, upcycling, cradle to cradle or\nservitization (Salmenpera, et al., 2021; Cui, 2021; Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2018;\n11", "text_len": 2409, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "62.Integrating the circular economy into construction waste management in NSW, Australia.pdf", "page_num": 12, "text": "Franco-Garcia & Aguilar, 2018). The thesis adopts the following definition of the circular\neconomy: “The circular economy can be framed as a regenerative system in which\nresource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimized by slowing,\nclosing, and narrowing material and energy loops. This can be achieved through long-\nlasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling.\n(Geissdoerfer, et al., 2017, p. 759)\nThe concept definition allows the identification of the circular economy practices in the\nliterature applied to the construction industry waste management practices. For example,\nhiring equipment to recycle demolished waste on-site reduces waste, transports\nassociated carbon emissions, and reduces raw construction materials, showing that\ncircular economy principles can be achieved using different strategies. Table 1\nsummarises the main concepts associated with the circular economy.\nConcept Definition\nClose-loop A system where there is no material loss during the\nproduction/manufacturing processes.

This can be\nextended to the construction industry, creating products that can be used as a new source\nof materials in the same manufacture chain or a new one.\nThe circular economy has been used to approach a wide array of problems across\nmultiple industries, for example, business (Bocken, et al., 2019), asset management,\nresource management (Guldmann & Huulgaard, 2020), goods and services production,\nmanufacturing, construction, tourism (Scheepens, et al., 2016). However, regardless of\nthe industry, CE principles are applied to incentivize sustainable practices that reduce the\nexploitation of environmental services and increase close-loop production and\nmanufacturing (Gheewala & Silalertruksa, 2020; Liu & Ramakrishna, 2021; Velzing, et\nal., 2019; Bocken, et al., 2019).\nCircular Economy has been appointed and acknowledged as a critical component of\nsustainable development, including environmental, economic, and social development\n(Korhonen, et al., 2018; Ghisellini, et al., 2016), changing the flow of materials and\nallowing the reintroduction of resources to the production processes. The aim is to alter\nthe traditional and current extract-produce-use-dump material flow that has been proven\nunsustainable and catastrophic to the environment because of the misuse of the available\nresources (Meadows & Randers, 2004; Wood, et al., 2017; Foundation, 2013).\n2.2.2 Sustainability\nAnother essential concept in the context of the construction industry is sustainability. The\nconstruction waste management industry applies sustainable practices through the 3Rs\nof sustainability, reduce, recycle, and reuse (Mohanty, 2011). Understanding the\nsimilarities and differences between sustainability and circular economy will give an\ninsight into how the construction industry integrates the concepts and the degree of\napplication in the industry practices.\nSustainability and sustainable development in the construction industry focuses on the\nenvironmental and social pillar and the implementation of changes in consideration of the\npositionality of the actor (Lima, et al., 2021). This means that the sustainability strategy\nfor the project site is considerably different that the one for the materials or waste, as the\nlatter is only considered a final output of the industry.

{"source_file": "62.Integrating the circular economy into construction waste management in NSW, Australia.pdf", "page_num": 14, "text": "concept of sustainable development has probably led to a worldwide acceptance of the\nthree key pillar frameworks to address environmental and social action (Seghezzo, 2009).\nSustainability is framed as the balanced and systemic integration of intra and\nintergenerational economic, social, and environmental performance (Geissdoerfer, et al.,\n2017). Sustainability has multiple definitions and strategies that apply in different contexts\ndepending on the focus, the organization, or the certification applied to each construction\nproject. It is often represented by three key pillars, economy, environment, and society\n(Seghezzo, 2009; Oke & Aigbavboa, 2017). Therefore, in the construction industry,\nsustainable development can be defined as “sustainable activities that harmonize and\nmaintain the balance of achieving developments that are economically profitable and\nfavorable, socially beneficial to people, and environmentally friendly to society at large”\n(Oke & Aigbavboa, 2017, p. 88). This means that sustainability is a fluid concept that\nadapts and provides flexibility to address the pillars of sustainability, considering the\npositionality from where it is used and temporality (Seghezzo, 2009).\nSome similarities between sustainability and circular economy found in the existing\nliterature mention that they both share a global perspective focusing on global issues on\na global scale, promoting shared responsibilities and accountabilities between multiple\nactors. They also approach challenges from an intergenerational commitment requiring a\nmultiplicity of coexisting pathways for development and a multi-disciplinary consideration\nto integrate social and cultural aspects (non-economic aspects) into the development.\nBoth consider new technology and business model innovation key in the transitions\ntowards either, resulting in the opportunity for future research as the available technology\nlags against the current expectations of both concepts (Geissdoerfer, et al., 2017). The\nconstruction industry must come to terms with both concepts' environmental, financial,\nand social agendas because the construction industry impacts all human activity through\nmultiple generations (Curwell & Cooper, 1998).\nIt is important to expand on the differences between sustainability and circular economy,\nas some practices can be sustainable but not necessarily apply the circular economy\nprinciples. For example, recycling throughout any process does not necessarily translate\nto reducing resources in a manufacturing process, as there can be sustainable practices\nwithout the obligation of maintaining a close loop (Geissdoerfer, et al., 2017).\nSustainability and circular economy have some differences, such as goals, motivations,\nsystem prioritisations, beneficiaries, timeframes, and responsibilities, that allow the\nunderstanding of the applicability and integration of the concepts in the construction\n14", "text_len": 2916, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

CE contemporary understandings share the idea of closed-loops where\nconsumption and production are considered a sink for the waste outputs of the existing\nindustries (Geissdoerfer, et al., 2017), focusing the motivations for implementation of\ncircular economy practices toward the efficient use of resources and waste reduction. On\nthe other hand, sustainability as a concept has outlined clear indicators as part of the\nSustainable Development Goals (Anon., n.d.), granting flexibility in implementing\nsustainable practices responding to different scales, situations, or contexts. However, that\nflexibility creates ambiguity when outlining the beneficiaries, timeframes, and\nresponsibilities of sustainable practices, as the contexts, goals, and motivations must be\nclarified, meaning, for example, that sustainable practices in the construction industry will\nbe different in the manufacturing industry.\nNevertheless, the difference between the two is that the circular economy's central idea\nis reducing the number of resources utilized, being narrow and conditional to the\napproach of the production and manufacturing process in balance with the financial\nimpact on the process. In contrast, sustainability allows the flexibility required to achieve\nthe sustainability development goals. Additionally, circular economy identifies the\ngovernment and private stakeholders as the beneficiaries, as they will reap the financial\nbenefits of implementing the closed-loop model. In comparison, CE's social impact is\ngenerated from environmental improvement and specific add-ons and assumptions like\nmore manual labor or fairer taxation (Geissdoerfer, et al., 2017).\nMoreover, the interest in the applicability of one concept to another varies. Circular\neconomy's principal reason for the interest is the potential financial advantages that can\nbe obtained from the optimization of the economics of the processes (Stahel & Reday,\n1976) and the reduction of material consumption for the production and manufacturing\nprocesses considering the limits on the capabilities of the earth and supply chain of the\nrequired materials. Sustainability reason of interest spreads across multiple dimensions.\nTherefore, it is classified as non-specific and has the flexibility to align with individual\ninterests. For example, sustainability can be gender equality opportunities in the\nconstruction industry or sustainable buildings. In sustainability, the reason for interest and\nthe prioritization strategy depends on the individual goals of the interested actor. The\ncircular economy is the opposite, as the system of prioritization focuses on the economic\ngains for social aspects, and even though the social aspects can vary between\nstakeholders, scales, and communities, the priority will always fall on the financial benefit\nand reduction of material leakage (Geissdoerfer, et al., 2017). Furthermore, a circular\neconomy has to follow timeframes attached to specific indicators that can be translated\n15", "text_len": 3000, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Conversely, sustainability timeframes are open similarly to the\nresponsibilities as they adapt to the specificity of the context and applicability of the\nsustainable principles.\nThe flexibility and openness of the sustainability criteria in construction waste\nmanagement have allowed the individual adjustment of the concept to suit individual\nprojects aligning the sustainability discourse without impacting the project's economics\nresulting in challenging barriers that discourage the industry transition (Pitt, et al., 2009).\nThis practice has the risk of leading to greenwashing.

The flexibility of the definition impacts the policies, as the multiplicity of\ndefinitions found impacts the implementation throughout the construction waste industry.\nPolicy regulation is important as the construction industry has one of the highest resource\nconsumption rates (Anon., 2022), putting pressure on the transition to more sustainable\npractices to reduce the industry's carbon footprint. As the industry is one of the primary\nwaste producers, including CE in the CWM provides a valuable opportunity to optimize\nthe available resources. The adoption of circularity within the CWM provides multiple\noptions for waste transformation into resources (Gheewala & Silalertruksa, 2020), i.e.,\ncradle to cradle, where materials, such as windows, concrete, and wood are designed to\nbe reused after the building is demolished (Nußholz, et al., 2020) or the recycling of wood\ninto high-density panels for joinery.\nAs the construction industry strives for sustainable practices, the introduction of CE offers\nunique insights into the application of circularity in large-scale scenarios with high\ncomplexity and multi-disciplinary requirements demanding a high level of cooperation\nfrom multiple industries. Therefore, the integration of the CE principles in the construction\nwaste management processes can be done across six stages of construction throughout\nthe design, manufacturing, procurement, transport, construction, and demolition by\nconsidering the multiple actors, stakeholders, and existing relationships have the\npotential to provide a unique opportunity to minimize the environmental impact of the\nconstruction industry by reducing the amount of material required in the construction\nprocesses (Shooshtarian, et al., 2022).\nFor example, one of the stages is design, where the lack of information, design errors,\nwrong specification of materials, client’s design brief, and design changes during\nconstruction presents some significant challenges. However, the integration of circular\neconomy principles during the design stage allows the development of strategies that\nfocus on the de-constructability of designs, standardization of projects, education, product\ncertifications, and waste design. (Shooshtarian, et al., 2022).\nOther literature mentions four construction stages: design, construction, procurement,\nand demolition (Poelman, 2009). The design stage considers using recycled materials or\nprefabricated elements, reducing the project’s carbon footprint, and future-proofing the\nproject's components for future disassembly. I.e., windows, joinery, walls. Recycling and\nreusing of materials must be promoted as much as possible during the construction stage\n(not considered in the design) (EPA, 2020). Procurement of materials provides an\nunderstanding of the supply and demand relation, identifying as a significant challenge\n18", "text_len": 2860, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The demolition stage is understood as the activity of destroying existing\nbuildings and producing waste that needs to be sorted and correctly processed to\npromote debris recycling.\nUnderstanding CE in the CWM context “offers a way to minimize waste’s environmental\nand economic costs, such as landfill maintenance, extracting virgin materials, landfill\nlevies, transportation costs, and illegal dumping” (Martin, 2019). That understanding\nprovides a strategic approach to the sustainable development of the construction industry\nusing as the central premise the use of waste as a new source of value for a business\ncreating and updating the existing practices in the construction industry. Current practices\nidentify some materials as potential resources, such as concrete, wood, steel, bricks,\nasphalt, or gypsum; however, the industry still does not recognize them as a resource as\nsome challenges must be addressed in practice, such as the cost, lack of education,\nquality, benchmark projects, supply and demand challenges, a market of construction\nwaste, storage, transport, contamination, separation, and equipment (Bolde, et al., 2013).\nAs construction waste is composed of multiple materials, the challenge is to provide\naccurate information about what material and how much is available for upcycling or\nrecycling (Korhonen, et al., 2018). To understand the efficiency and long-term\nimplications of the repurposing of the materials and rebranding of waste as a new\nresource, organizations have promoted monitoring the tons of waste created/required by\nthe CI activities (OECD, 2022or example, steel is monitored closely by the OECD and\nCWM organizations, as reprocessing steel technology is available and provides\nquantitative information that later can be distributed to the interested parts promoting the\nexchange of material across industries (OECD, 2020). Additionally, the intrinsic\nmechanical characteristics allow for close-loop markets where the material is reused and\nre-manufactured (Broadbent, 2016) that can be easily monitored through current\npractices. This is not the case for all other materials, information, and data.\nCE literature applicable to multiple industries has gaps regarding the impact of social\nequity and future environmental development as they are rarely mentioned, as well as\nthe roles of the market, business models, and consumers as enablers implementing\ncircular practices (Kirchherr, et al., 2017).

Some case studies (Baloi, 2003) have been\ndeveloped around specific construction projects, which have identified some “structural\nbarriers that hinder the transition to a circular economy in construction and demolition\nwaste management” (Cardoso da Silva, et al., 2022, p. 2). The structural barriers refer to\nthe operational flow that characterizes the construction industry in consideration of the\nsequence of works in a project.\nAs the current practices evolve, it is essential to note that the introduction of new digital\ntechnologies is critical to facilitate circular economy practices (Arts, et al., 2015;\nGheewala & Silalertruksa, 2020; Geissdoerfer, et al., 2017), and they have slowly become\npart of the construction industry practices which address critical items of the construction\nwaste management through data analysis such as materials, buildability approaches,\nmaterial composition and quality, embodied carbon, and supply availability.\nIntegrating the new technologies with the current practices is done through the\nconstruction certification programs that outline a project's sustainability and circular\neconomy objective criteria.

The regulations were found on the official NSW portal, and the latest versions\nand addendums were included when applicable. Table 4 contains the policies that were\nselected for the policy analysis.\nThe review of the policies used content analysis to examine the main acts regulating\nconstruction waste management in NSW. The policy review aims to understand the\nlandscape and current state of the existing policies; therefore, the content analysis\nallowed the understanding of how the policies are worded and the policies' objectives and\naims. Moreover, content analysis as a method allows the systematic and objective means\nto describe and quantify specific data using a tailored unit of analysis which is used for\nthe quantification of data through the codification of the information (Downe-Wamboldt,\n1992). Even though content analysis varies and does not specify a single set of rules,\nDowne-Wamboldt outlines the general steps that provide a procedural sequence for the\nresearch project.\nA framework to analyze the content is developed to understand the objectives, aims, and\nexpected outcomes and determine what words were included within the policies. The key\nwords were selected using the three main concepts identified in the literature review,\ncircular economy, construction waste management, and practices in the industry. As they\nare broad umbrellas that encompass several concepts, the identification of any word that\nentails sustainable practices, circular economy concepts or practices, or any practice of\nthe industry was identified and flagged using a matrix that allowed the quantification of\nthe qualitative analysis.\nThe analysis criteria of the selected policies are composed of three categories, (1) the\noverall target, aim, and objectives, (2) key words, and (3) operational and/or technological\nrecommendations. Table 5 shows the unit of analysis and the category system for the\ncontent analysis process of the policies. The general criteria aimed to understand the\npolicy nature by identifying the target audience, rationale, and expected outcomes. The\nKeyword selection aims at recognizing the rhetoric of the policies and exploring the mode\nof communication of the objectives focused on the two main concepts identified in the\nliterature review: circular economy and construction waste. Finally, the policy review tried\nto pull out any recommendations or requirements for the guidelines or processes that\nimpacted construction waste management.\n30", "text_len": 2661, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The chapter demonstrates that the policy in construction waste management\nhas challenges that must be addressed to facilitate the transition towards circular\neconomy practices through policy implementation.\nThe chapter begins by identifying how the CE principles and practices are regulated in\nthe selected policies when focusing on construction waste management. The chapter\nexplores the disconnection between existing regulations and construction waste\npractices, meaning that the current policies do not specify conditions around construction\nwaste. Moreover, the chapter explores the challenges of the current policies in the\nconstruction industry context.\n4.2 Content of policies\nIt is clear from the outset that construction waste management is not heavily regulated by\nthe Environmental Protection Authority (EPA). The general guidelines and policies\nprovided by the EPA are unclear. Despite the regulations seeking to cover all of the waste\nstreams per the categorization made by the EPA (EPA, 2014), there are no specific\npolicies for construction waste, such as the Waste Avoidance Act (Goverment, 2001).\nUsing the approach explained in section 3.3.1, the policies' quantitative data was\ncondensed in Figure 4. The latter shows the low presence that some selected key\nconcepts have in the policies noting that in some instances, the definition included in the\npolicies vary. Recycling, with a 12% presence, is one of the most popular concepts in the\npolicies and is mentioned from time to time as a strategy for sustainability and resource\nmanagement. The waste database is just mentioned when the requirement for reporting\nthe amount of waste for the bi-annual reports for the policies analysis is stipulated in the\nProtection of Environment Administration Act 1991. On the other hand, technology is used\nquite broadly to reference the use of tools that allow the efficient and compliant\n38", "text_len": 2133, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

However, the policies do not mention specific tools or\ntechnologies for implementing the policy, as compliance can be achieved through\ndifferent means.\nFigure 4 - Policy Review Content Analysis Key Concepts\n4.3 The absence of distinct Construction Waste Management policies and\ndefinitions of circular economy\nOne of the research findings is that Construction Waste Management policies could be\nenhanced in two critical areas as it currently fails to address the circular economy goals\nand transition strategies. Firstly, there is a need to address construction waste\nspecifically. Out of the eight reviewed policies that aim to preserve, monitor, and\nrehabilitate the environment, only six mention construction waste management, explicitly\nreferring to construction waste. Furthermore, the structure of regulations that regulate\nconstruction waste management is not precisely fit for purpose, as the regulations do not\nfocus on individual waste streams. For example, the Waste Avoidance and Resource\nRecovery Act 2001 No 58 aims to regulate waste recovery. However, it applies not only\n39", "text_len": 1110, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For example, the environment is defined in the\nEnvironmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 as everything that “includes all\naspects of the surroundings of humans, whether affecting any human as an individual or\nin his or her social groupings.” However, in the Protection of the Environment\nAdministration Act 1991 No 60, the environment is defined “as components of the earth\nsuch as (a) land, air, and water, (b) any layer of the atmosphere, (c) any organic or\ninorganic matter and any living organism, (d) human-made or modified structures and\nareas, including interaction natural ecosystems that include components referred into (a)\nto (c).”\nAnother key concept throughout the policies is the definition of ecological sustainable\ndevelopment found in the definition sections of the policies. It embodies the sustainability\nprinciples and aims to articulate economic development with sustainable practices to\nmeet the present needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their\nneeds (Emmery, 1993). This concept is part of the applicable regulations as it promotes\nsix principles that could be qualified as sustainable, yet are treated as ecological\nsustainable development to integrate the economic considerations. Even though\nEnvironmental Sustainable Development integrates economic and financial\nconsiderations with the conservation of the environment, there is not an evident horizontal\nintegration of the circular economy principles in the existing regulations.\nThere is potential for Circular economy principles to enhance and reorient policy and\npractice by addressing the manufacturing process's economic and environmental\nimpacts. In contrast to the policies above, the NSW Waste Strategy (Department of\nPlanning, 2021) has directly incorporated circular economy principles into its goals yet\nstill fails to segregate and address the multiple waste streams. Its strategies are non-\nmandatory to the construction industry. The goal of reducing the waste generated by\nperson and increase to 80% the recovery rate from all waste streams by 2030 involves\nstrategies such as recycling, reusing, and repurposing within the construction waste\nmanagement industry. Such goals show the potential for sustainable approaches to be\n40", "text_len": 2739, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

NSW Waste Strategy establishes the 80% goal for construction and demolition\nwaste reduction and avoidance. However, according to the reports included in the NSW\nstate strategy, by 2019, it was 77%. However, it does not specify the different waste\nstreams included in the percentage given, specifically the construction waste industry\ntons (Department of Planning, 2021). It is unclear what waste streams are considered\nbesides the putrescible and non-putrescible waste classifications per the Waste\nClassification Guidelines Part 1: Waste Classification (EPA, 2014).\nThe Protection of the Environment Operations (Waste) Regulation 2014 does not outline\nrequired practices or any of the minimum objectives for waste management. It focuses\non how the operational processes of waste collection work. This means the focus is on\nfunctioning infrastructure, such as residential and commercial buildings, where waste\nneeds to be disposed of and transported in a certain way. The regulation outlines the\ncontributions and the exemptions as well as the required reports and surveys that must\nbe provided by the Environmental Protection Authority of New South Wales (Goverment,\n2014). There is no mention of any special consideration for the construction waste stream\nputting into evidence the lack of regulation around the industry.\nNSW Policies considers the reduction of waste minimization and waste management of\nthe construction activities as part of the core ideal of most of the policies. However, none\nof the policies mention how to manage, reduced, and recycle construction waste. For\nexample, the Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery Act 2001 No 58 does mention\nthe preferred outcomes of the waste management processes. It fails to differentiate the\nconstruction waste stream from the other non-putrescible waste.\nOverall, the policy analysis found that under the Protection of the Environment\nAdministration Act 1991 No. 60, eleven mentioned acts, of which only two mention waste\nmanagement. However, no specific policies or regulations focus solely on construction\nwaste management. The analyzed policies demonstrate how poorly integrated\nsustainable practices are with construction waste management as the waste stream is\nclassified with all non-putrescible waste. Integrating key concepts in the policies is\nsubjective, and there are no definitions for the selected strategies, allowing free\ninterpretation of the approaches. Moreover, the Development Control Plan requires a\nwaste management plan for the development application for a project; however, the focus\nis towards the operations of the project once it is occupied, transferring the responsibility\n41", "text_len": 2845, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

At the same time, the lack of congruency across the reviewed policies\nexposes a weakness of construction waste management as identified in the existing\nliterature, providing this as a barrier in the transition towards circular economy practices.\nFinally, the broad categories of the waste streams in the policies impose a challenge in\nconstruction waste management as the strategies focus on the general waste (non-\nputrescible) stream.\nThere is an evident development lag between current sustainable practices and the acts\nthat regulate them. For example, one of the objects of the Protection of the Environment\nOperations Act 1997 is the “reduction in the use of materials and the re-use, recovery,\nand recycling of materials.” Nevertheless, there are no clear strategies for achieving this\nor considerations for accomplishing the action object meaning that materials can be\nclassified as recycled, but that does not mean that it is the most efficient use. i.e., waste\nto energy input material.\n4.4 Summary\nThe policy review has provided three key findings. Firstly, circular economy principles are\nnot currently directly embedded in the policies that apply to waste management. However,\nthe concepts that align with the principles are considered part of practices aligning with\nthe principles of ecologically sustainable development. The application of sustainable\ndevelopment principles “requires the effective integration of social, economic and\nenvironmental considerations in decision-making processes” (Government, 1991) and\nprovides specific programs and practices such as “minimizing the creation of waste by\nthe use of appropriate technology” (Government, 1991). However, the latter puts into\nevidence the lack of specificity in waste management practices that apply to the\nconstruction industry as part of the policy review findings.\n42", "text_len": 2343, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

First, the chapter will\nidentify the roles and responsibilities of the actors involved in the current practices in the\nconstruction waste management industry. And then, the findings around the industry\npractices that include the circular economy principles aim to analyze the data collected\nfrom the participants focusing on their expertise and previous professional experience.\nFinally, a summary of the findings will be presented, gathering the key ideas found in the\ninterviews.\n5.1 Overview of construction waste management in NSW: actors and\nresponsibilities\nThe Construction industry is one of the world's biggest industries. It includes an endless\ncombination of resources that are not limited to the materiality of the resources but also\ninvolves services provided by different disciplines and actors. The multiple relationships\namong the actors involved in a construction project vary, impacting the level of\nresponsibility. Figure 5 shows the current practices' interactions during the project\nconstruction, as mentioned in chapter 3. The first stage, design, and planning, involves\nthe client/property developer and consultants. During the procurement and construction\nstage, the builder is the one that hast all the contractual obligations as it is responsible\nfor the execution of the project.\n44", "text_len": 1662, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Only two\nparticipants did not know the principles of the circular economy. However, when\nexplained, they both provided practices that in their field are identified as sustainable\npractices, such as using recycled brick for aesthetic details in the building of the façade.\nNotwithstanding the knowledge of the circular economy practices of all other interviews,\nthe variance of the definition of circular economy and its applicability confirms that “a\nconcept which fails to cohere may ultimately collapse or remain in a deadlock due to\npermanent conceptual contention, not only in research but also in practice, since\ncumulative knowledge development on it is impeded” (Kirchherr, et al., 2017). This is\ncorroborated once the interviews continue to explain the practices. Overall, the current\nconstruction waste management industry practices do not recognize practices such as\nrecycling or reuse as circular economy practices but more as sustainable practices.\n5.2 Who is taking responsibility for construction waste management?\nExploring the role of specific actors\nThis section draws on interviews to explore the various roles of specific actors and\ndiscuss the different stages of construction to understand potential opportunities for\ncircular economy principles to be embedded in practice. In particular, it focuses on the\nrole of builders, clients and consultants, and Waste management consultants.\n45", "text_len": 1627, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The\nresponsibility of the project is to the builders. They transfer specific responsibilities to\nother consultants as required, meaning that consultants must provide professional advice\nfor which they are responsible under the code of ethics of their discipline. However, that\nresponsibility ends where the builder allows it to. One respondent noted:\nThe builder is located at the epicenter of construction. The clients … they\nall have good intentions, but they do not get out of their own way.\nConsultants have no authority over the control of materials, demolition, and\nthings like that. Subcontractors they do what you paid them to do. So the\none with all the influence is really the builder (ND, 2022).\nBuilders are situated as the actor in charge of building the project and mediating the\ncommunications and responsibilities for addressing waste between all other actors.\nSeveral respondents noted that the builder engages the contractors, and the contractual\nobligation is directly to them. Suppliers relate to consultants, builders, and contractors.\nHowever, the first interaction is with the consultant specifying the construction materials,\nand then the builder can procure the materials directly form the supplier, or the contractor\ncan supply them. It depends on the modality of contractual engagement selected.\nFigure 5 shows the multiple interactions that will vary depending on the stage of the\nproject. For example, in the design and planning stage, the communications are between\nthe consultants and the client/property developer until the local council approves the\nproject. After that, the procurement stage starts, and that is when the builder gets\ninvolved. The hierarchy of the interaction changes, as the builder is the one engaging the\nconsultants and the contractors. The latter relationship hierarchy also applies to the\nconstruction and demolition stages.\nClient and Consultants\nDuring the design and planning process, the client/property developer submits a design\nbrief with all the requirements and considerations that must be included in the design for\nthe architect to incorporate in the project proposal.

However, the waste management plan does not include the construction\nwaste management generated in the execution of the project. However, because\nconstruction waste management does not have a regulation or standard, consultants take\nresponsibility for ensuring that circular economy principles are integrated throughout\nconstruction waste management.\nOnce the project has the Development Application approved and the builder has been\nappointed, “consultants do not have any authority over the control of materials,\ndemolition, and things like that” (ND, 2022). This creates a shift of responsibilities, as,\ndespite the professional responsibilities, the “decision-making process is driven by costs,”\nas identified by four interviewees (FT, 2022; CN, 2022; EP, 2022; ND, 2022).

However, to facilitate a broader transition towards circular economy\npractices, all actors must play a role, as the multiplicity of resources involved in the\nconstruction industry cannot be centralized in the builder’s practices. This means that\nconsultants, builders, clients, contractors, and suppliers need to be required, through\nregulations, policies, and guidelines, to implement circular economy principles in their\npractices, processes, and procedures if the industry is to transition toward becoming a\ncircular economy actor.\nThe interviews provided critical insights about the actors in the construction waste\nmanagement process and who is responsible for its disposal. As their professional\nbackground varied and belonged to different project stages, it provided insights into how\nconstruction waste management is approached. The consensus is that no circular\neconomy practices were embedded in the construction industry or in construction waste\nmanagement. Some practices were perceived as sustainable practices, such as the\n“reuse of structure” (CN, 2022), but they are also observed as circular economy practices.\nFor example, one respondent noted:\n… QQ Tower… is the biggest example in the world of re-using the concrete\ncore of an existing asset.

Only two out of the\nsix interviewees were aware of circular economy and sustainable definitions and\npractices, which reflects the lack of responsibility from the industry overall to educate\nprofessionals in these subjects. The amount of awareness of sustainable practices and\ncircular economy is directly related to the seniority of the people in the industry. The\nparticipants who knew were in senior positions with more than ten years of experience,\nwhich means that the knowledge has been gathered through professional experience,\nnot because it is part of the discipline-required knowledge. Out of the six interviewees,\ntwo had less than ten years of experience, and neither of them where familiar with the\ncircular economy principles.\nMoreover, when asked about the circular economy, all the interviewees transition the\nconversation to sustainability and sustainable practices, suggesting that sustainability is\nmore embedded in the construction waste management industry. This creates a\nchallenge in implementing circularity, as there are no evident distinctions between the\ntwo. However, as outlined in Chapter 2, the definitions vary, but this is not perceived\nduring the interviews; the two are interchangeable when discussing circular economy\npractices.\nCircular economy aims not only to reduce the number of required resources building an\neconomy around the processes focusing on the financial benefit.

The most commonly mentioned materials that could be recycled\nor reused were bricks, timber, and concrete. Steel is part of the focus of the interview.\nHowever, participants did not have any information or previous experience with the waste\nmanagement of steel. ND mentioned the ability to “order the right amount of reo” (ND,\n2022), which means that the residual steel on-site is minimized. Bricks were mentioned\nby five participants noting that they are used in localized areas of a project as “recycled\nbrick is more expensive” (MI, 2022). In some cases, it is cleaned on-site; however, other\nlogistics must be considered, such as transportation and storage. Another material\nmentioned is the required formwork. “Formwork … got their own circular economy going\n… they reuse every bit of form” (ND, 2022); the amount of material disposed on site is\nminimal compared to the amount used. For example, one respondent noted:\n… there's formwork and the guys are happy to they they've got their own\ncircular economy going 100% they reuse every bit of form very little form\nleave site in a bin.

All interviewees mentioned that the desire for\ncircular economy practices “rarely comes from the client” (MI, 2022), meaning that\narchitects and consultants must engage with the client to bring them on board with any\nnew practices, taking into consideration the risks created by the lack of information about\nconstruction waste management and circular economy practices.

None of the participants\ninterviewed were involved in monitoring construction waste management. They all\nemphasized that the building contractor must provide a report with a breakdown of the\nrecycled, burned, or disposed of waste. However, “No one monitors if that is true” (MI,\n2022). The lack of monitoring of the construction waste is identified as a transferred\nresponsibility from the builder to the waste contractor (EP, 2022; ND, 2022; FT, 2022), as\nthere is no obligation for any of the other identified actors to monitor beyond the boundary\nof the project. For example, one respondent noted:\nSo, we don't really monitor or like oh that building being efficient like how\nmuch power does the building consume in a month like we don't get to see\nthose details because unless from my perspective once you've finished a\nproject you are already thinking of the next one and there is no one unless\nit is the project manager or the client coming to you with those numbers or\nlike with that data you wouldn’t really know if the product that you had in\nmind is what you've been executed (EP, 2022).\nMoreover, all the participants commented on the lack of monitoring from the actors\ninvolved regarding the waste, as long as the report “says we have avoided the landfill …\nthey do not care if the waste has found its way back into a circular economy” (ND, 2022).\n51\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nso we need to source them and then the builder would go and try to source\nthem and then hopefully report back I found some and then where it's not\nwhere it wasn't possible then we would have to use new materials there but\nthe initial kind of starting point is from the architect.

The lack of knowledge of the circular economy theory and the\nmisunderstanding and misuse of the concept in the construction industry creates a\nchallenge to its applicability. Moreover, the lack of clear differentiation between\nsustainability and circular economy practices significantly impacts the industry practices\nas it confuses actors and stakeholders involved, altering the desired results.\nExisting practices are determined by key actors with the power and authority to implement\ncircular practices. However, these decisions are made taking into consideration mainly\nthe financial viability and feasibility of the practices, putting the consultants in a position\nwhere they are the ones that need to propose an argument that the circular economy\npractices are the best option and will provide the best outcomes for the project.\nThe construction industry already incorporates certain waste management practices for\nspecific materials, such as bricks and timber, that reflect circular economy principles to\nsome extent. However, participants discuss such practices and understand such\npractices as sustainable practices rather than as part of a circular economy approach.\n53\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nimpacts.

Discussion\nThe findings demonstrate that the construction industry has practices that address waste\nmanagement but that the industry’s perception is of sustainable practices rather than\ncircular economy practices. This chapter addresses research question 3 and reflects on\nthe challenges and opportunities of integrating the circular economy into construction\nwaste management, considering the multiplicity of actors and responsibilities, policies,\nand current practices of construction waste management, situating the thesis findings\nwithin the academic literature. First, the chapter discusses the challenges for the\ntransition from an epistemological perspective understanding the various definitions of\ncircular economy. Second, understanding the level of influence of the policies in the\nindustry and actors’ practices considering the construction industry positionality regarding\nconstruction waste management. Finally, the chapter discusses the overall challenges\nand opportunities around current practices in the transition towards circular economy\npractices in construction waste management in the construction industry.\n6.1 Circular economy or sustainable practices: Definitions and industry\ninterpretations\nThere is an opportunity in the construction industry to enhance the collective\nunderstanding of the meaning and application of circular economy principles and\npractices. This section provides insights into key domains of intervention: the consistent\nincorporation of circular economy definitions in regulation and the need for more explicit\nindustry understandings of circular economy to differentiate these from the concept of\nsustainability.\nOne key challenge is the inclusion of the concepts and definitions in the current practices,\nincluding policies that currently include discrepancies between definitions. This has\ncreated ambiguity in the industry as the definition is not even clear from a theoretical\nperspective. Kirchherr analyses 114 definitions and proposes an additional one;\nmeanwhile, the construction industry struggles with an applicable definition to discuss\ncurrent practices (Kirchherr, et al., 2017). The current policy review showed the\nincongruence amongst definitions; therefore, conceptual and practical understandings of\nthe Circular Economy are not clearly outlined in the regulatory policies.

Nevertheless, they lack regulatory power, as they are not mandatory for the\nindustry.\nA clear example is the definition of the environment across two relevant policies\nevidencing the difference between the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act No\n203 (Government, 2022) from the Protection of the Environment Administration Act, as\nshown in Table 8. The discrepancy of definitions shown below presents a challenge for\nthe policy implementation, impacting the scope of acquired responsibility by the actors as\nengagement with the environment in the construction practices. The lack of consensus\nor bridging between definitions allows actors to implement basic minimum requirements\nthat comply with a less comprehensive understanding of their responsibility.\nPolicy Environment: Definition\nEnvironmental Planning “includes all aspects of the surroundings of humans,\nand Assessment Act No whether affecting any human as an individual or in his\n203 or her social groupings.”\nProtection of the “means components of the earth, including—\nEnvironment (a) land, air and water, and\nAdministration Act (b) any layer of the atmosphere, and\n(c) any organic or inorganic matter and any living\norganism, and\n(d) human-made or modified structures and areas,\nand includes interacting natural ecosystems that\ninclude components referred to in paragraphs (a)–(c)”.\nTable 8 - Definition discrepancy of Environment in the policies with regulatory power\nThe research showed the need for a consistent definition and framework of circular\neconomy principles and practices to be incorporated into construction waste\nmanagement. The interviews demonstrated that multiple definitions and understanding of\nthe circular economy practices impose a challenge to consistently implementing\nguidelines and policies. ND explained, \"I think maybe part of the problem is the way we\nhave complicated the word circular economy…” (ND, 2022). The challenge arises not\nonly from the multiplicity of definitions but also from the level of knowledge involved in the\nvarious actors involved in a project. People working in the construction industry have\nvarious levels of education such as those who did not finish high school working on the\nsame project as those with degree qualifications.

Providing a clear industry understanding of the differences between\ncircular economy and sustainability would assist the incorporation of circular economy\nideals in construction waste management processes. Industry actors have different\nexperiences and diverse understandings of circular economy principles depending on\ntheir positionalities. For example, three out of the seven interviewees were unaware of\nwhat the concept meant, demonstrating a knowledge gap within the construction waste\nmanagement field as circular economy principles are not applied throughout a project's\nentire construction, let alone through waste management processes. Nonetheless, the\ninterviewees who were aware of the circular economy practices tended to shift to wording\nthe practices as sustainable practices. The understanding of how the model works is\nthere; however, the industry has approached it as sustainable practices that happen to\ninclude circular economy principles, as demonstrated in the response by ND:\nFirstly, I don’t think many people know what circular economy are, only\nthose that either attend the seminars and … listen to things or those who\nactually work in sustainable circles, and the unfortunate thing is they are a\nsmall part of the industry. The bulk of the industry got a little bit of an\nunderstanding around what sustainability is, but only where it comes into\ntheir data… (ND, 2022).\nThis means that the interpretation of the existing concepts of the industry fails to serve\nthe existing practices. This aligns with Kirchherr says that\na concept which fails to cohere may collapse or remain in a deadlock due\nto permanent conceptual contention, not only in research, but also in\npractice, since cumulative knowledge development on it is impeded\n(Kirchherr, et al., 2017).\nFinancial viability is a key consideration for scholars working in the circular economy field,\nwhich differs slightly from the equal weighting placed upon social, economic, and\nenvironmental benefits evident in triple-bottom-line sustainability approaches. For\nexample, Kirchherr & Van Santen considered that “the main aim of the circular economy\nis considered to be economic prosperity, followed by environmental quality; its impact on\nsocial equity and future generations is barely mentioned.” (Kirchherr & Van Santen, 2019,\np. 2) The interviewees corroborate such emphasis on economic viability as one of the\nmain criteria for incorporating circular economy principles putting into evidence that for a\ntotal embracement of circular economy practices, the consideration of economic\nprosperity is vital, as it determines the sustainability of the circular model in the\n57", "text_len": 2891, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

In summary, the main challenges stem from the lack of consensus\nin the definition of the circular economy concept and strategies in the policies relevant to\nconstruction waste management impedes the transition using current policies as it allows\nfor a free interpretation and implementation throughout the industry. Moreover,\nunawareness of the differences between sustainability and circular economy practices\ncreates confusion in implementing the concept during construction. Furthermore, the\neducation of involved actors in the construction industry creates an excellent opportunity\nto transition towards circular economy practices. However, the process cannot be made\ndisregarding the existing practices, and the definitions must be congruent across the\nconstruction industry, construction waste industry, and policies to achieve an effective\ntransition.\n6.2. Policies Influence and Actors' Responsibility in practice\nDiscussions throughout chapters 4 and 5 points to the need for additional waste\nmanagement regulation for circular economy principles to be implemented. As previously\nmentioned, actors are acting on the minimum legal requirements because the current\nregulations do not specifically target construction waste, and the responsibility of\nmanaging waste is transferred to the waste consultant alone. Interviews reiterated the\nneed for further actors in the construction to take responsibility. Despite interviews\ninvolving a design architect, project manager, director project manager, property\ndeveloper, and an architecture sustainability manager, the only interviewee indicating a\ndesire to integrate circular economy principles into construction waste is the architecture\nsustainability manager.\nThe insights about the need for further regulation and specific policies to integrate circular\neconomy principles confirm Kirchherr’s (2017: p3) point that “neither business models nor\nconsumers are frequently outlined as enablers of the circular economy” they are all looked\nat as part of an existing structure that considers them as a component rather than\nenablers. At the same time, the existing roles in construction waste management\npractices need to further understand the factors that enable the transition towards circular\n58", "text_len": 2623, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

However, after analyzing the data, one\ncan identify that three main variables must be considered when integrating circular\neconomy practices in the construction waste industry: financial viability, the complexity of\nactor responsibility, and supply and demand.\nFirstly, financial viability is a crucial topic discussed with the interviewees as influencing\nthe three stages of construction projects. Actors are indisputably interested in including\ncircular economy principles in construction waste practices. Each interviewee shows\nsignificant interest in including such practices to promote sustainable approaches to\nconstruction waste management. However, the lack of information available to actors\nwithin the industry is challenging, creating a gap between the people who can transform\nthe industry and those with the relevant information and understanding that facilitates\nsuch transformation. This gap results in the perpetuation of a perception that\nimplementing circular economy principles will be expensive and complicated, resulting in\nenthusiasts being discouraged from implementing it.\nSecondly, one participant explains, “everyone knows the right thing to do, people have\ndifferent authority levels to make things happen, but they will not know what to do” (ND,\n2022). Actually, “doing the right thing” by following circular economy principles requires\nactors to ensure proper demolition processes are being followed for the industry to\nrecover the materials, transport them, store them, and facilitate their redistribution. Such\na complex process may not be enticing enough to attempt such a task. As (Kirchherr, et\nal., 2017) explain, companies\n“…may take the path of least resistance to adopt CE if waste hierarchies\nare not explicated, e. g. only improving their recycling and thus only a small\npart of their operation, without the needed overhaul of the entire supply\nchain, mode of operation and the radical change in product materials.\nParticularly CE implementation based on definitions that do not outline\n‘Reduce’ as CE’s priority can result in CE subverted to the cause of\ncontinuing an unsustainable business-as-usual model”.\nWhen the preference for the least resistance path is combined with lax policies,\nexpectations for any improvement in the construction industry go out the window. The\nconstruction waste management industry requires specific policies and appointed\nresponsibilities to be able to achieve the goals that the government set. This is not only\nto make sure that the industry is improving its practices but also to ensure they are\ncommitting to such policies long-term, as several companies in studies by (Kirchherr, et\nal., 2017) quickly lost interest in incorporating circular economies as it was not promoted\nas a long-term undertaking for future generations. Moreover, understanding the\n59", "text_len": 2886, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This added complexity of embodied carbon and its implications for a\nbroader understanding of the need to incorporate circular economy principles requires\nfurther analysis and research.\nThirdly, supply and demand are other factors required to aid the transition to a more\ncircular economy model. Supply and demand are closely connected to the financial\nviability of circular economy practices, as the construction industry's supply of materials\nmust endure the constant demand for construction. Rose & Stegemann (2018) identified\nthe supply of recycled material, as she mentioned the lack of information about the\nmaterials and the potential for interrupted supply chains. Interviewees echoed such\nsentiments, indicating that despite the desire to include recycled materials in construction,\nthey were concerned that there is not enough in the market to be used across multiple\nconstruction projects (Rose & Stegemann, 2018). Some materials that are identified as\neasy to recycle and reuse come with significant challenges must be analyzed through a\nmultilayered lens. For example, plasterboard can be reutilized, as it can be easily patched\nand repainted. However, the recovery process, recertification, and transportation make\nsuch reuse challenging. Additionally, the constructability requirements of walls that use\nplasterboard need to be considered, as there is an expectation that such walls are rigid\nand sturdy, adding on a construction requirement that the plasterboard is also de-\nconstructible, which in practice would be challenging.\nFinally, there is a need for clear guidelines with regulations that specifically incorporate\ncircular economy principles. The construction industry is heavily regulated and has many\ndifferent codes, laws, and standards that need to be considered at the moment of\nexecution of a construction project (Standards, 2022; Australian Building Codes Board,\n2022). Australia’s efforts to promote sustainable practices, standards, and codes have\nincluded considerations that allow the usage of recycled and reclaimed materials that\ncomply with a project's technical and mechanical requirements. The application and\npractices of sustainable approaches to construction reflect construction waste\nmanagement throughout the whole life cycle of a project and its requirement of explicit\nlegislation specifically addressing construction waste (Shooshtarian, et al., 2022).\nIn summary, the positionality of the participants from the specificity of their roles provides\nan integration of existing relations between participants in construction waste\n60", "text_len": 2861, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

It shows how the policies are involved in the current\npractices and how it allocates responsibilities in the industry. The current challenge is the\nlack of regulations targeted toward the industry practices, allowing the vague\nimplementation and dismissal of any best practice of circular economy. The opportunity\nhere lies in the future development of policies that consider the circular economy in the\npolicies with legislative power, including the allocation of responsibilities for the different\nactors in consideration of the current relation between actors and policies found in this\nthesis.\n6.3 Construction Waste Management Practices: Challenges and\nOpportunities\nAn overview of six key opportunities and challenges was identified across the data\ngathering and discussing chapters for incorporating circular economy principles into\nconstruction waste management our outline throughout this section. First, including\nresource recovery in the construction industry ecosystem promotes and creates a\nconstruction waste management industry. Second, the opportunity to understand the\nfinancial feasibility of circular economy practices will potentially increase the circular\neconomy implementation. Third, the opportunity to use new technology that supports\ncircular economy practices, making materials’ information readily available for actors to\nuse. Fourth, the key challenge of identifying the potential impacts and risks in the\nconstruction process circular economy practices could have, including material quality\nand delays in the construction program. Fifth, the opportunity to update regulations\nconsidering the recommendations made by the relevant actors, and the current\ninefficiencies, such as ambiguity in the policies. Sixth, information is a key component in\nthe transition as it provides the tools and key strategies in the construction waste\nmanagement practices promoting circular economy.\nFirst, as shown in Figure 6 the industry has the potential to include a resource recovery\nactor, which can be made by an individual actor or be adopted by the existing ones. This\nmeans that every actor could feed the supply chain with recycled materials and offset the\nwaste that ends in landfill. The need for new materials would be reduced, and each actor's\naccountability level would increase by taking such a step. Recognition of all actors as\nenablers of circular economy principles in the multiple cycles of supply and different\nrelationships between actors is the key component to fast-track the transition.

It requires all actors\nwithin the construction industry to make sure that the materials are in constant movement,\nreducing the costs and impacts on the environment. This will promote the development\nof a new industry that promotes and distributes recyclable and reusable materials that\ncan be quickly re-introduced in the supply chain to construct new projects.\nFigure 6 – Integration of Resource Recovery\nSecond, any incorporation of circular economy principles must address the waste\nmanagement processes' financial viability to justify any change. When construction\nmaterials are cost-effective and justify the costs of implementing new practices, the\nindustry will consider and prefer them to existing practices (CN, 2022; EP, 2022; ND,\n2022; FT, 2022; MI, 2022). For example, one respondent noted that\n... in order to implement all of these things you need to supplement the\neconomy somehow needs to pay for itself but there also needs to be the\nright resources around the place so you’re not overstretching the builder in\nthe middle that’s the difficult bit if you’ve got a senior project engineer on a\nbig tower there’s already working 12 hour days for two or three years on a\nproject you’re not going to have a lot of luck going to them and saying I want\nyou to walk the job all day every day and administer people or I want you to\nallocate one of your engineers who’s already stretched comes in six days a\nweek (ND, 2022).\n62", "text_len": 1501, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Nowadays, there a several business grants that\nwaste companies can access to innovate and explore new practices throughout the\nindustry. The potential to develop technologies that control and reduce construction waste\nmanagement is evident.\nThird, introducing new digital technologies is a key opportunity for assisting in selecting\nmaterials and measuring environmental impact through embodied carbon analysis. Such\nopportunities were mentioned by two of the participants. Integrating embodied carbon into\nsoftware shows the industry's desire to introduce new practices into the construction\nindustry. Current practices are starting to introduce digital technologies that allow the\nmeasurement of embodied carbon which uses the life cycle assessment (LCA)\nmethodology aiming to quantify the environmental impacts of products and processes\nthroughout their entire life cycle, i.e., from ‘cradle-to-grave.’ As Rock, et al., 2020 note,\n“this approach provides a sound methodological basis for calculating energy consumption\nand assessing resource depletion, GHG emissions and other environmental indicators\nover the full life cycle of buildings” (Rock, et al., 2020, p. 2). New technology is currently\nbeing developed to assist such measurement, as there is no actual data about the\neffectiveness or impact of new technology in construction waste management. However,\nas mentioned by some interviewees, the challenges continue, as it is not a common\npractice for life cycle assessments to be applied to every project. The opportunity to\nimprove construction waste management practices and make informed decisions that\nconsider the life cycle of materials and understand the percentage that can circle back\ninto the supply chain is critical to promote the transition towards circular economy\npractices.\nAn additional opportunity identified is the use of the embodied carbon app, as it will aid in\nconsideration of material selection, including transportation, the amount of raw material,\nand recycled material needed. In addition, such an app will provide architects with multiple\noptions for building design. However, that still leaves the challenge of the supply of\nrecycled materials. Digital technologies have the potential to facilitate information and\nintegrate data from suppliers analyzing the carbon footprint, financial impact, and material\navailability. Although the software is still in the early stages, the potential for a ripple effect\nin the industry is there.\n63", "text_len": 2686, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This is a critical challenge in the transition to circular economy practice\nas those practices are typically perceived as more expensive. For example, when a brick\nbuilding is demolished but the new construction does not include brick, it is most likely\nthat the project team disposes of the bricks as they would not use bricks in the same\nproject. Therefore, in this instance, the waste contractor could apply the circular\neconomy, not the builder. In contrast, when a new project includes brick, the costs\nincrease as recycled brick is more expensive than new brick. Rose and Stegemann\n(2018: p. 15) note that “the potential of reuse to reduce disposal costs for waste\ngenerators and reduce material costs for new construction has not been adequately\ndemonstrated,” and therefore, the resistance to transitioning construction towards a\ncircular economy approach persists.\nFifth, there is a need and opportunity for regulation to play a key role in facilitating the\nimplementation of clear, comprehensive, and appropriate circular economy processes in\nthe construction industry. When we look at the history of the most significant changes in\nthe construction industry, Work Health and Safety provides a great example of how the\nindustry had to adapt to improve the existing practices and the critical role regulation\nplayed. Initially, Work Health and Safety processes were guided by national standards\nand codes of practices that were not mandatory:\nThe National Standards did not have legal status and were not enforceable\nunless a jurisdiction adopted them into their OHS regulations. This led to\nsignificant differences nationwide regarding which protocols were adopted,\nhow jurisdictions drafted and applied them, and whether they were adopted\nas a code of practice or regulation (Australia, 2022).\nDespite all efforts, change in practice did not occur until the government developed work\nhealth and safety regulation that made healthy and safe practices mandatory. Similarly,\nthere is a sincere desire to do things right, and some actors are taking responsibility for\nthe environment and being accountable in their practices. However, the complexity of the\nconstruction waste management industry requires all actors to be involved and\naccountable and transparent regulations that make such practices mandatory rather than\nvoluntary to be successful.\nSixth, Rose, and Stagemann (2018) identified the lack of available information about the\nrecycled materials that can be used in new construction as a challenge for incorporating\ncircular economy practices in construction processes. This challenge is corroborated by\nthe interviewees, who expressed a desire to implement circular economy practices but\ndid not understand where to find information. Such a challenge presents an opportunity\n64", "text_len": 2904, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

However, the\nknowledge gap in implementing circular economy practices is considerable. It is\nexacerbated by the lack of regulations and policies around construction waste, leaving\nany change or transition at the discretion of an industry with a small profit margin and\nconstantly overstretched. That is why it is so important to minimize the impact that the\ntransition has on current practices. Actors provided insight into the different relationships,\nengagement, and responsibilities between the relevant stakeholders and the existing\npolicies enabling and restricting the incorporation of circular economy principles.\nSome critical challenges identified by actors, and reinforced by the literature, are the\nmultiplicity of definitions of circular economy which impedes the integration of the\nprinciples into the current practices of the construction industry due to the conceptual\nslippage between the concepts of sustainability and circular economy. The free\ninterpretation of the concepts allows actors to interact with the principles and definitions\nas they wish, creating an environment of convenience and a lack of accountability. This\nflexibility extends to the existing policies as they do not provide a clear definition that can\nbe consistently applied to the circular economy practices in the construction waste\nmanagement industry.\nAnother challenge for the policies is implementing regulations that directly target the\nconstruction waste stream and the general definition of the various waste streams. The\nlack of specificity provides an easy way away from circular economy practices, as no\n65", "text_len": 2548, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Moreover, the lack of\nintegration of practical information into the policies challenges any transition as it will\nresult in the expression of the market's desire to develop new practices.\nInformation and availability around the quality and availability of materials that support\ncircular practices impose one of the biggest challenges as the high demand for products\nin the construction industry. National quality standards and quality expectations must be\nmet regardless of the origin of the materials causing, demanding the material that is\nrecuperated must ensure the required specifications as if they were new. Consumers who\nuse circular materials must have confidence in the quality of the process. The challenge\nis the supply and quality of information around the available materials. At the same time,\nthis provides a challenge for operational processes which are required to transition\ntowards circular economy practices in the construction industry. The lack of empirical\nresearch and information available that demonstrates how to implement circular economy\npractices on-site creates frustration for potential advocates and reinforces the lack of\ninterest, as the complexity of the task requires a considerable amount of initial funding\nand resources that no one is willing to pay for at present.\nAs construction waste management is still developing, the opportunity to integrate\nmultiple products and manufacturing industries through circular economy practices can\nsupport data collection and promote circular economy practices in the construction\nindustry.

Conclusion\nThis thesis aims to investigate the current practices of the construction waste industry\nthrough the circular economy lens to determine, if so, how the current practices in the\nindustry implement the circular economy principles. This chapter summarizes the\nessential findings and the study limitations and opportunities for future related research.\n7.1 Summary of findings\nThis section summarises the findings by addressing the research questions in turn.\nRQ1 How are principles of the circular economy considered within policies\nrelevant to construction waste management?\nThe research found that the policies with regulatory power do not have embedded circular\neconomy principles despite mentioning recycling and reuse as strategies in construction\nwaste management.\nPolicies do not consider the construction waste stream as an independent material\nsource. They treat construction waste as a homogenous mix of resources enabling the\nmixing of materials and discarding the possibility of sorting practices on site which allows\ntransportation as a resource rather than waste. Even though it belongs to one of the\nprimary industries in NSW, Australia, it does not have special consideration for\nconstruction waste management.\nLastly, policies do not consider the multiple actors as enablers of circular economy\npractices nor as responsible agents. This perpetuates the lack of accountability across\nthe industry actors, as the responsibility of construction waste management rests on a\nconsultant at the project's construction stage.\nRQ2 How does the construction industry put the circular economy into practice in\nconstruction waste management?\n67", "text_len": 1660, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "62.Integrating the circular economy into construction waste management in NSW, Australia.pdf", "page_num": 68, "text": "The responsibility of construction waste management is centralized on the builder; this\npromotes a diminished sense of accountability, taking the responsibility away from\nconsultants in their practices. Even though it is a considerable challenge, it presents an\nequally great opportunity. The ability to expand the multiple disciplines' knowledge with\nnew practices that consider the interconnectivity of the construction ecosystem and\npromotes circular economy practices, such as using up-cycled material from other\nprojects.\nRelating to the supply and demand of materials, the challenge lies in the industry's ability\nto maintain balanced supply and demand levels. One of the challenges and concerns of\nbuilders is the procurement process, where they must maintain the construction program\nkeeping the project execution on track and within budget.\nBudget-friendly practices are a key finding from the interviews as current actors and\nstakeholders have the challenge of balancing the quality of the materials and the\nenvironmental cost providing an argument for the value of the project. Architects, for\nexample, have the challenge of starting the conversation of the circular economy\npractices when the design is being developed, allowing the builder to have the\nconsideration when planning the execution of the project. Not all the existing practices in\nthe construction industry that have been discussed despite being sustainable include the\ncircular economy principles.\nThe continuous implementation of circular economy practices in construction waste\nmanagement has the potential to change the responsibilities of the actors, as they would\nbe distributed in consideration of the stage of the project. This means that the construction\npractices will be proactive towards construction waste as it will be addressed from the\nearly stages rather than when it is generated.\nRQ3 What are the challenges and opportunities of incorporating circular\neconomy principles into construction waste management?\nMost of the challenges in the construction waste management impose an excellent\nopportunity to develop a circular economy around materials that are easy to sort and\nprocess, being able to introduce practices that can promote the development of the\nconstruction waste industry, transforming the waste stream into resources not only for the\nconstruction industry but for others.\n68", "text_len": 2381, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "62.Integrating the circular economy into construction waste management in NSW, Australia.pdf", "page_num": 69, "text": "Three identified challenges are the lack of information on empirical research of circular\neconomy practices in the construction waste industry. Despite the actors' desire, the lack\nof incentives results in the implementation of the practices by the more prominent players\nsuch as Mirvac, Built, and other big companies leaving the more minor actors bound to\nthe traditional practices due to a lack of financial availability to develop new practices.\nOne of the main opportunities is the integration of circularity in the construction industry\nthroughout all project stages, promoting the circular economy principles across multiple\nconsultants. However, the main challenge is the lack of evidence of the financial feasibility\nof the practices.\nThe financial viability and the costs of the circular economy practices are a big challenge,\nas the construction industry is under significant financial pressure, resulting in a lack of\nadditional budget for practices that are not required. The desire to implement the new\npractices goes until the budget is impacted.\n7.2 Limitations and future research\nThe research did not focus on the structural composition of the policies across Australia;\nthe geographical positionality limited the understanding of the complete legislative\nstructure around construction waste management, and the findings of lack of policies\napply solely to New South Wales, Australia. Further research must be conducted to\nanalyze the extent of the legislations across the federal, state, and local levels of the\nscope of the acts.\nOne of the main limitations of the research is the analysis of the current practices from\nthe circular economy standpoint identifying the financial viability of the practices\nintegrating the theoretical with empirical analysis of the existing practices. At the same\ntime, due to the limited amount of time, the research could not produce statistical or\nnumerical information that supports that the current practices are meeting the objectives\nof the circular economy by reducing the amount of required virgin material. Further\nresearch where the practices are analyzed in the complete context of the construction\nindustry using materials rather than projects as case studies, where the life cycle is\nunderstood and followed through, focusing on the financial sustainability of the process,\ncan determine the effectiveness of current practices while utilizing circular economy\nprinciples.\n69", "text_len": 2440, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Further research can\nbe developed around the situationality and the implementation of circular economy in the\nconstruction industry using the individual actors involved in construction waste\nmanagement to understand the social and cultural impact of the practices.\nThe participant pool is small (seven participants) and does not include waste contractors\nor demolition companies. This is subject to future research considering the financial\nfeasibility of the empirical implementation of circular economy practices.\nThe integration of circular economy in the construction waste management industry has\nbeen slowly engaged by actors who desire to improve construction practices and facilitate\nfurther the transition towards circular economy practices. Actors must be the enablers of\nthe voluntary transition. Education and responsibility understanding is required across the\nwhole construction industry as the multiplicity of definitions of circular economy acts as a\nbarrier that permits the bare minimum in circular practices. Moreover, actors must be\nempowered through their disciplines to understand their influence in the construction\nwaste management industry regardless of the project's stage. Finally, the integration\nmust include the intervention of policies that promote and incentivize the circular economy\nprinciples embedded in the regulations. The clarity of the definitions of concepts and goals\nis imperative to guarantee congruency across the construction waste management\nindustry.\n70", "text_len": 1739, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The purpose of the study is to\ndetermine how the construction industry has implemented digital technologies to\nfacilitate a transition to a circular economy, specifically in relation to steel. This study\ninvolves speaking to representatives from organisations across the construction\nindustry. In this capacity, your experiences are important and will be crucial for the\nstudy.\nThe study is being conducted by Lizeth Vanessa Arango Cardozo to meet the\nrequirements of the Master of Research degree under the supervision of Associate\nProfessor Sara Fuller, (02 9850 8385, sara.fuller@mq.edu.au) and Dr Miriam\nWilliams (02 9850 2153, miriam.williams@mq.edu.au) from the Discipline of\nGeography and Planning, Macquarie School of Social Sciences.\nParticipation in the study will involve taking part in an interview, either face-to-face\nor on Zoom, exploring current practices regarding the use, treatment and disposal of\nsteel in the construction process. The interview will last 30-45 minutes and will\nconsider the adoption of circular economy principles, organisation’s practices, and\nconsiderations around waste in the construction industry, and the digital tools used\nin the process, including the challenges and potentials.\n82", "text_len": 1755, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
