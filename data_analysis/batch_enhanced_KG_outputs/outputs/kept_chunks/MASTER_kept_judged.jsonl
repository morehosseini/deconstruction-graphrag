The application of sustainable\ndevelopment principles “requires the effective integration of social, economic and\nenvironmental considerations in decision-making processes” (Government, 1991) and\nprovides specific programs and practices such as “minimizing the creation of waste by\nthe use of appropriate technology” (Government, 1991).

Waste recovery\ncan be described as any operation in which the principal result is waste serving a useful resource\nby replacing other materials which would otherwise have been used to fulfil a particular function,\nor waste being prepared to fulfil that function, in the plant or in the wider economy (Hall, 2010).\nAccording to the waste hierarchy concept, waste recovery (in the forms of reusing, recycling,\nupcycling and energy recovery) is the most preferred waste management method after waste\nminimisation. The following sections present key literature related to the abovementioned\nrecovery methods, and other influential factors such as technology, marketplace and policies\nenabling waste recovery in the AEC industry.\nReusing construction materials in the AEC industry does not currently receive support due to a\nwide range of inhibiting factors specified in the literature (Canberra Business Chamber, 2014,", "judge": {"label": "maybe", "confidence": 0.7, "reason": "Discusses C&D waste recovery and reuse, with mention of barriers, but lacks direct focus on deconstruction governance or specific legislative frameworks."}}

Several\nstudies observe that waste operators apply cost-benefit analysis to decide the waste fate\nbetween recycling and landfilling options accordingly (Fini and Forsythe, 2020, Rameezdeen et\nal., 2016). Such an analysis covers separation cost, transport fees, the number of waste\nmaterials and recycling benefits. Tennakoon et al.
