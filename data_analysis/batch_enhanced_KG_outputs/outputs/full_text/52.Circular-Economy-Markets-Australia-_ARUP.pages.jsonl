Over the coming decade alone,\nglobal battery demand is forecast to increase 18-fold with forecasts\n1\nconstantly accelerating. That means by 2030 demand for lithium will be\naround 3 million mt/year. Australia is an important supplier in the current\n2\nvalue chain delivering a massive 39% of global lithium extraction in 2023.\nCircular economy opportunities for secondary lithium from batteries if\nunlocked could be as much as AUD3.1B.3\nAustralia is a serious participant in the global Net Zero transition, accessing\nsignificant virgin quantities of critical minerals for development of the\nworld’s batteries. These materials are primarily mined and exported as raw\nore for materials processing overseas. However, over the next decade a\ncircular opportunity worth between AUD0.6 and AUD3.1 billion remains3\navailable for Australia in secondary resources from its own used LIBs - only\n4\n3% of which are currently recycled. Securing resilience, reducing sovereign\nrisk and retaining critical mineral supplies for domestic development will\nalso be important considerations for Australia and its trading partners.\nWhile China remains the dominant player for many of the value chain\nelements required for the global energy transition - including the battery\nvalue chain - many countries are seeking to grow their domestic\ncapabilities. Countries are activating new markets via ambitious policies.\nIt is both an exciting time and challenging one for the Australian LIB\nindustry. Demand for batteries and constituent materials is rapidly\nincreasing while supply can fluctuate. Key challenges for lithium include:\nvalue chain volatility; environmental impacts; and collection and recycling\nquality.

Over the coming decade alone,\nglobal battery demand is forecast to increase 18-fold with forecasts\n1\nconstantly accelerating. That means by 2030 demand for lithium will be\naround 3 million mt/year. Australia is an important supplier in the current\n2\nvalue chain delivering a massive 39% of global lithium extraction in 2023.\nCircular economy opportunities for secondary lithium from batteries if\nunlocked could be as much as AUD3.1B.3\nAustralia is a serious participant in the global Net Zero transition, accessing\nsignificant virgin quantities of critical minerals for development of the\nworld’s batteries. These materials are primarily mined and exported as raw\nore for materials processing overseas. However, over the next decade a\ncircular opportunity worth between AUD0.6 and AUD3.1 billion remains3\navailable for Australia in secondary resources from its own used LIBs - only\n4\n3% of which are currently recycled. Securing resilience, reducing sovereign\nrisk and retaining critical mineral supplies for domestic development will\nalso be important considerations for Australia and its trading partners.\nWhile China remains the dominant player for many of the value chain\nelements required for the global energy transition - including the battery\nvalue chain - many countries are seeking to grow their domestic\ncapabilities. Countries are activating new markets via ambitious policies.\nIt is both an exciting time and challenging one for the Australian LIB\nindustry.
