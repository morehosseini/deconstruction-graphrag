Infrastructure Australia, an independent advisory agency, has applied best practice methodologies in\ndeveloping and assessing the proposed reforms in the 2021 plan. They include applying a theory of change\nframework to ensure the recommendations follow a structured pathway to achieve Infrastructure Australia's\nvision for 2036 to have infrastructure that improves the sustainability of the country’s economic, social,\nenvironmental and governance settings, builds quality of life for all Australians, and is resilient to shocks and\nemerging stresses. Multi-criteria analysis is used to articulate the trade-offs and implementation challenges\nassociated with the reforms. The 2021 Plan is supported by the 2021 Reform Priority List and 2021\nImplementation Pathway to provide a detailed evidence-based plan for governments to implement reforms\nthat will create meaningful outcomes for all Australians.\nStakeholder engagement is a significant focus of the 2021 Australian Infrastructure Plan. Infrastructure\nAustralia engaged with more than 5,500 individuals, including domestic and global policy leaders, to test the\nconclusions and identify reform opportunities. The plan has also been informed by an extensive sector-specific\nengagement program that targeted industry experts, government, and academia. In addition, Infrastructure\nAustralia engaged extensively with stakeholders for the 2019 Audit and ran a formal stakeholder submissions\nprocess for which they received 151 formal submissions from government, industry and academia, as well as\na small number of individuals. All this feedback was considered when developing the 2021 Plan.\nREFERENCES:\n• Infrastructure Australia (2021), 2021 Australian Infrastructure Plan, https://www.infrastructureaustralia.gov.au/2021-australian-infrastructure-plan", "text_len": 2578, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
