Can we increase the percentage of recycled content to reduce the amount of virgin materials used? How do we\noptimise flexibility and quality of design to realise changes of use that might take place over, say, a 50-year timespan? Can we look\nat new types of structures (/en-ca/services/structural-engineering) that can be disassembled easily for use in other buildings at the\nend of the building's life, for example by incorporating bolted connection systems?\n\n \n\nThen we would consider the interior fitout. Rather than a company coming into a building and starting from scratch with new\nfurniture and equipment that gets thrown out when it breaks or at the end of the tenancy agreement, everything is rented — similar to\nUber, where we use the service rather than owning a car. So instead of buying furniture, lighting systems, even lifts, the building\nowner can rent them, shifting the onus for quality, maintenance and repair onto the providers. Rather than throwing away a chair\nbecause it’s cheaper to replace than fix, you send it back for mending — creating jobs for people who know how to repair stuff.\nEventually the circular economy will be the catalyst for a big economic shift."}

Will it add to\nthe cost of construction?\n\n \n\n \n\nVP: International recognition of the growing threat of waste to the environment (/en-ca/sectors/environment) and the limitations of a\nlinear consumption model have led to significant economies like China, the European Union and the UK taking a leading role in\nintroducing circular economy principles to their policies. Here in Australia, our government has been motivated by China’s waste\nimport policy (known as China’s Sword) that imposed restrictions to the import of multiple Australian recyclables materials in 2018\ncombined with the increasing cost of waste to landfill to go beyond recycling through the implementation of circular economy\ninitiatives. Given the environmental impact of construction on the built environment (/en-ca/sectors/environment), there are big\ngovernment pushes to implement these principles. And | do feel that the construction industry in Australia is ready to listen. As a\nvolunteer member of the Urban Land Institute's Sydney Committee, | recently spoke at an event about the circular economy specific\nto the built environment (/en-ca/sectors/environment)in Australia, which was very well received."}

For example, in construction the building code will need to be updated to allow the use of\nremanufactured elements and greater quantities of recycled content in building materials in a safe way. But | feel things are moving.\nFor example, the New South Wales State Government has a draft policy to guide decision making towards a circular economy to\ndeliver positive economic, social and environmental outcomes and to embed circular economy principles in Government policies,\nstrategies and programs. An important next step would be to mandate procurement of higher quality materials that last, and for\nmaterials to include a certain percentage of recycled content.\n\nIn terms of costs, there is still some resistance, being a new concept. However, from the studies I’ve researched, when you consider\nthe whole lifecycle of the building there are key financial benefits including higher value for future assets, capture residual value of\nconstruction materials and higher leasability.\n\f\n\n[PAGE 3]\nae |\n\nCircular y\nEconomy ! :"}
