Only 1% of\nwaste is recovered for reuse or recycling, making it the lowest rate in Australia at 63% below the national resource recovery\naverage.\nTasmania’s distance to mainland markets and processing facilities and the relatively under-developed local resource recovery\nindustry contribute to this result, but there is more we can be doing today to positively impact Tasmania’s environment and\nthe wellbeing of future generations. Here are some simple steps to help your business rethink waste…\n1.
