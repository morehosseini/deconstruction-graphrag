Minister’s foreword\nThe ACT Government is leading\nthe way to a sustainable future.\nWe aspire to be a thriving and equitable city that respects the limits of our\nplanet. We recognise our responsibility to act on the urgent challenges of a\nchanging climate and minimising our environmental footprint.\nThis is why the ACT Government is turning our attention to how we can create,\nsupport and foster a circular economy right here in the ACT. We want to do this\nby moving away from the idea of a throwaway society to one which prioritises\nrepair, reuse and recycling and by maintaining the intrinsic value of resources,\nreducing waste, and encouraging design which focuses on the whole life cycle\nof a product.\nI am pleased to release the ACT’s Circular Economy Strategy and Action Plan\nwhich outlines actions and opportunities to build a circular economy for the\nACT.\nWe have identified six key themes to drive our initial efforts, including\nfood and organics, the built environment, consumer goods, emerging and\nproblematic waste streams, creating space to showcase our commitment to\nthe circular economy, and procurement, skills, innovation and governance.\nAfter months of focused consultation on the draft ACT Circular Economy\nStrategy, we have heard that there is a strong willingness in the community and\nin industry to participate in a circular economy. Feedback we have received has\ntold us that many parts of the community are already demonstrating behaviours\nconsistent with the principles of a circular economy.\nWe have held workshops with industry and business representatives, and\ncolleagues from the Canberra region under each of the Strategy themes. Their\nenthusiasm and engagement gives me great confidence in our ability to grow\na very successful circular economy in the ACT.\nWorking together will be critical to our success. We know that the next steps\nto achieve our goals requires continued effort from all of us. From businesses,\nconsumers, producers, and sellers – we will all need to take part.\nIt’s encouraging that there is already a wide range of services available in the\nACT that support the circular economy, such as repair cafes, charity stores,\nshared mobility, and reusable coffee cup schemes. The ACT Government has\nalso introduced several initiatives supporting greater circularity, such as bans\non single-use plastics, implementing a container deposit scheme, and using\nrecycled content in our infrastructure projects.\nThere is more work to do and this Strategy outlines how we will work towards\nbuilding the circular economy. It also highlights areas for industry, business\nand government to continue working together. I also look forward to engaging\nwith the Canberra community, including our business and industry partners,\nto deliver the Strategy and Action Plan as we work towards the goal of\nCanberra becoming a circular city.\nChris Steel MLA\nMinister for Transport and City Services\nACT Circular Economy Strategy and Action Plan 1", "text_len": 2970, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Making it happen\nCollaboration is vital for the transition towards a circular\neconomy – not one government, industry, business or\ncommunity member can achieve this on their own. A key part of\nour success will be the way we approach collaboration; we must\nconsider how to move beyond the typical top-down approach\nand accelerate our transition by working together, aligning\nstakeholders and encouraging everyone to move beyond\ntraditional roles and responsibilities in a cooperative way.\nAcross Canberra, government, businesses, industry and\nthe community will drive the transition by putting circular\nsolutions into practice. Businesses drive innovation and\nprovide great opportunities to reduce costs and build resilience\nin supply chains by adopting a more circular approach.\nTertiary education institutions, including universities and the\nvocational education and training sector will be integral to skill\nour future circular economy workforce, while partnerships with\nthe research and innovation sector and industry will be critical\nto driving effective reuse and recycling of materials, improve\nproduct design and materials recovery processes.\nThis Strategy and Action Plan is structured around a vision and\nkey themes to progress circular economy. It is only the starting\npoint of a journey towards our longer-term goal of Canberra\nbecoming a circular city through a collaborative approach with\nall stakeholders. As the circular economy matures in the ACT, in\nthe future, we may explore opportunities to expand the focus\nto other areas of the economy that could benefit from greater\ncircularity beyond the themes identified in this Strategy.\nTo achieve the vision and ambition identified for each theme,\naction plans have been developed that guide implementation\nover the coming years. This includes future potential actions\nthat are subject to future Government consideration and may\nhave budget impacts. Development of the circular economy\nindicator as part of the ACT Wellbeing Framework provides an\nopportunity to monitor our progress. As the circular economy\nmatures in the ACT, there may be further opportunities to\nutilise a range of wellbeing indicator datasets to evaluate\nthe success of a circular economy. In addition, waste audits,\nwhich provide an analysis of the waste composition and\ncontamination rates will help us track the prevalence of certain\nwaste types in the ACT, such as emerging and problematic\nwaste and could inform future decision making.\nACT Circular Economy Strategy and Action Plan 20", "text_len": 2525, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
