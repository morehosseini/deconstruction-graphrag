If noise from your\nindustrial premises exceeds those limits, it will always be considered\nunreasonable,” Mr Miezis said.\n\nFinding out whether you're pushing the limits is straightforward; there\nare qualified contractors who can assess noise levels at and around\nyour site and advise if you need to install additional controls to keep it\nwithin reasonable limits.\n\n“However, eliminating unreasonable noise is also about common\nsense. Think about the noise, does it happen early or late at night?\nWhat's the volume and intensity? These are some of the factors that\nhelp decide if noise is unreasonable,” he said.\n\n“Assessing the noise you make can help you understand the risk of\nharm it poses. If noise is unreasonable, it is probably creating a risk of\nharm and needs to be controlled’\n\nEPA can use fines and prosecutions to hold polluters to account\nwhere necessary, but many noise problems are resolved with advice\nand cooperation.\n\nEPA's Applied Noise Framework Guidance Series is designed to help\nbusinesses understand their responsibilities with explanations on\nwhich parts of the laws are more relevant to different business sectors\nand practical examples of businesses achieving compliance to\nprotect the community and environment.\n\nFor the guidelines and other guidance on complying with the law,\nEPAs website has plenty of help for business to reduce risk from\npollution and waste:\n\nUnreasonable noise guidelines explains the concept of unreasonable\nnoise, what makes noise unreasonable and how to assess\ncompliance, and provides examples to show how to comply.\n\nCommercial, industrial and trade noise guidelines explains the noise\nframework and limits that apply to factories, stores and shops, depots\nand other sites. It includes links to industry-specific advice, for\nagriculture, construction, manufacturing, mining/quarrying, retail,\nwaste/recycling and wind farms.\n\n \n\nAssessing_and controlling risk: a guide for business explores how a\nbusiness can assess and control risks under the GED and minimise\nrisk of harm before it occurs. This includes assessing risk from noise.\n\n \n\nThere are practical guides to noise prevention methods such as site\nplanning, acoustic louvres, barriers, mufflers, pipe lagging and\nvibration isolation epavic.gov.au/for-business/find-a-\ntopic/noise/advice-for-businesses/controls\n\f", "text_len": 2491, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
