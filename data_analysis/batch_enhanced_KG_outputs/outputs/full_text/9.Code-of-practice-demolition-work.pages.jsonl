Following an approved code of practice will assist the duty holder to achieve compliance with the\nhealth and safety duties in the WHS Act and WHS Regulations, in relation to the subject matter of the\ncode of practice. Like regulations, codes of practice deal with particular issues and may not cover all\nrelevant hazards or risks. The health and safety duties require duty holders to consider all risks associated\nwith work, not only those for which regulations and codes of practice exist.\nCodes of practice are admissible in court proceedings under the WHS Act and WHS Regulations. Courts\nmay regard a code of practice as evidence of what is known about a hazard, risk, risk assessment or risk\ncontrol and may rely on the code in determining what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances to\nwhich the code of practice relates. For further information see the Interpretive Guideline: The meaning of\n‘reasonably practicable’.\nCompliance with the WHS Act and WHS Regulations may be achieved by following another method, if it\nprovides an equivalent or higher standard of work health and safety than the code.\nAn inspector may refer to an approved code of practice when issuing an improvement or prohibition\nnotice.\nScope and application\nThis Code is intended to be read by a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU). It provides\npractical guidance to PCBUs on how to manage health and safety risks associated with demolition work.\nThe guidance in this Code is relevant to demolition contractors as well as PCBUs who have management\nor control of workplaces where excavation work is carried out, for example principal contractors.\nThis Code may be a useful reference for other persons interested in the duties under the WHS Act and\nWHS Regulations.\nThis Code applies to all workplaces covered by the WHS Act where demolition work is carried out and\nwhere demolition work products and equipment are used and stored.\nPersons who have duties in relation to demolition work should also refer to the Code of Practice:\nConstruction work.\nHow to use this Code of Practice\nThis Code includes references to the legal requirements under the WHS Act and WHS Regulations. These\nare included for convenience only and should not be relied on in place of the full text of the WHS Act or\nWHS Regulations. The words ‘must’, ‘requires’ or ‘mandatory’ indicate a legal requirement exists that must\nbe complied with.\nThe word ‘should’ is used in this Code to indicate a recommended course of action, while ‘may’ is used to\nindicate an optional course of action.", "text_len": 3221, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Therefore, when carrying out demolition work, the\nrequirements relating to construction work must also be complied with.\nDemolition work is also ‘high risk construction work’ if it involves demolition of an element of a structure\nthat is load-bearing or otherwise related to the physical integrity of the structure. A Safe Work Method\nStatement (SWMS) must be prepared before the high risk construction work starts. Further guidance on\nSWMS is available in section 3.4 of this Code.\nFurther guidance on construction work and high risk construction work duties is available in the Code of\nPractice: Construction work.\nOther key terms relating to demolition work are listed in Appendix A.\nWho has health and safety duties in relation to demolition work?\nDuty holders who have a role in managing the risks of demolition work include:\n• persons conducting a business or undertaking (PCBUs)\n• designers, manufacturers, importers, suppliers and installers of plant, substances or structures,\nand\n• officers.\nWorkers and other persons at the workplace also have duties under the WHS Act, such as the duty to take\nreasonable care for their own health and safety at the workplace.\nA person can have more than one duty and more than one person can have the same duty at the same\ntime.\nEarly consultation and identification of risks can allow for more options to eliminate or minimise risks and\nreduce the associated costs.\nThe main duties in relation to managing the risks of demolition work are set out in Chapter 2.\nPerson conducting a business or undertaking\nWHS Act section 19\nPrimary duty of care\nA PCBU must eliminate risks arising from demolition work, or if that is not reasonably practicable, minimise\nthe risks so far as is reasonably practicable.\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nWHS Act section 19\nPrimary duty of care", "text_len": 2514, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Hazards generally\narise from the following aspects of work and their interaction:\n• physical work environment\n• equipment, materials and substances used\n• work tasks and how they are performed, and\n• work design and management.\nHazards may be identified by looking at the workplace and how work is carried out. It is also useful to talk\nto workers, manufacturers, suppliers and health and safety specialists and review relevant information,\nrecords and incident reports.\nPotential demolition hazards arise in a number of ways, including:\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nWHS Regulation 34\nDuty to identify hazards\nWHS Regulation 35\nManaging risks to health and safety\nWHS Regulation 36\nHierarchy of control measures\nWHS Regulation 37\nMaintenance of control measures\nWHS Regulation 38\nReview of control measures\nWHS Regulation 297\nManagement of risks to health and safety\nWHS Regulation 299\nSafe work method statement required for high risk construction work", "text_len": 2173, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

A risk assessment can help you determine:\n• how severe a risk is\n• whether any existing control measures are effective\n• what action you should take to control the risk, and\n• how urgently the action needs to be taken.\nHazards have the potential to cause different types and severities of harm, ranging from minor discomfort\nto a serious injury or death.\nMany hazards and their associated risks are well known and have well established and accepted control\nmeasures. In these situations, the second step in the process outlined in section 1.3 of this Code to\nformally assess the risk is not required. If, after identifying a hazard, you already know the risk and how to\ncontrol it effectively, you may simply implement the controls.\nIn some circumstances, a risk assessment will assist to:\n• identify which workers are at risk of exposure\n• determine what sources and processes are causing the risk\n• identify if and what kind of control measures should be implemented, and\n• check the effectiveness of existing control measures.\nThe nature and severity of risks will depend on various factors, including the:\n• the structure to be demolished and its structural integrity\n• the method of demolition including its sequencing\n• the scheduling of the work\n• the layout of the workplace including whether there are fall hazards both for people\nand objects\n• what plant and equipment will be used and the skill and experience required by the people who\nwill use it safely\n• what exposures might occur, for example to noise or ultraviolet (UV) rays\n• the number of people involved, and\n• local weather conditions.\nFurther guidance on the risk management process and the hierarchy of control measures is available in the\nCode of Practice: How to manage work health and safety risks.", "text_len": 2591, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

If someone has been hurt doing a\nparticular task, then a hazard exists that could hurt someone else. These incidents need to be investigated\nto find the hazard that caused the injury or illness.\nControlling the risks\nWHS Regulation 142\nNotice of demolition work\nThe hierarchy of control measures\nThe WHS Regulations require duty holders to work through the hierarchy of control measures when\nmanaging certain risks; however, the hierarchy can be applied to any risk. The hierarchy ranks control\nmeasures from the highest level of protection and reliability to the lowest.\nEliminating and minimising the risk\nYou must always aim to eliminate the risk. For example, undertake work at ground level to eliminate the\nuse of cranes and the need to work at height. If eliminating the hazards and associated risks is not\nreasonably practicable, you must minimise the risk by one or more of the following:\n• Substitution—minimise the risk by substituting or replacing a hazard or hazardous work practice\nwith something that gives rise to a lesser risk. For example, using a mechanical demolition\nmethod rather than a manual method.\n• Isolation—minimise the risk by isolating or separating the hazard or hazardous work practice\nfrom any person exposed to it. For example, using concrete barriers to separate pedestrians\nand powered mobile plant to reduce the risk of collision.\n• Engineering controls—engineering controls are physical control measures to minimise risk. For\nexample, fitting an open cab excavator with a protective structure to minimise the risk of being\nstruck by a falling object.\nIf risk remains, it must be minimised by implementing administrative controls, so far as is reasonably\npracticable, for example by installing warning signs.\nAny remaining risk must be minimised with suitable personal protective equipment (PPE), for example\nproviding workers with hard hats, hearing protectors and high visibility vests.\nAdministrative control measures and PPE do not control the hazard at the source. They rely on human\nbehaviour and supervision and used on their own tend to be the least effective in minimising risks.\nChapters 4-6 of this Code provide information on control measures for demolition work.\nFurther guidance on the risk management process and the hierarchy of control measures is available in the\nCode of Practice: How to manage work health and safety risks.\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nWHS Regulation 142\nNotice of demolition work", "text_len": 3062, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

In most cases, a combination of the control measures will\nprovide the best solution to minimise the risk to the lowest level reasonably practicable.\nYou should also ensure that the control measures you select do not create new hazards, for example\nelectrical risks from contact with overhead powerlines or crushing and entanglement from plant like\nelevating work platforms (EWPs). If any new hazards are created they must also be controlled.\nMaintaining and reviewing control measures\nControl measures must be maintained so they remain fit for purpose, suitable for the nature and duration\nof work and installed, set up and used correctly.\nThe control measures put in place to protect health and safety should be regularly reviewed to make sure\nthey are effective. Checking effectiveness may involve, for example air monitoring to measure the\nconcentration of crystalline silica in the worker’s breathing zone during the abrasive blasting process. If the\ncontrol measure is not working effectively it must be revised to ensure it is effective in controlling the risk.\nYou must review and as necessary revise control measures so as to maintain, so far as is reasonably\npracticable, a work environment that is without risks to health or safety. For example:\n• when the control measure does not control the risk, so far as is reasonably practicable\n• before a change at the workplace that is likely to give rise to a new or different risk to health\nand safety that the measure may not effectively control\n• a new or relevant hazard or risk is identified\n• the results of consultation indicate a review is necessary, or\n• a health and safety representative requests a review.\nCommon review methods include workplace inspection, consultation, testing and analysing records and\ndata. Where demolition work is ‘high risk construction work’ a SWMS must also be reviewed and revised\nwhere necessary.\nYou can use the same methods as in the initial hazard identification step to check control measures.

In this approach, the designer considers the structure in its completed form with all the\nstructural components, including bracing, installed. The completed structure can withstand much higher\nloads, including wind and other live loads, than when the structure is in the construction or demolition\nstage. With this in mind, it may be necessary for the designer to provide guidance to the demolition\ncontractor on how the structure will remain standing as it is demolished or dismantled.\nThe principal contractor, or the demolition contractor if there is no principal contractor because it is not a\nconstruction project, should take all reasonable steps to obtain the designer’s safety report.\nFor demolition work, there may be a number of designer safety reports available including:\n• the report prepared for the original construction of the structure\n• any reports prepared for subsequent additions or alterations to the structure, and\n• where a designer is engaged for the demolition work, the report provided to the person\ncommissioning the design of the demolition work.\nDesigners who develop demolition specifications or procedures for the demolition of a structure should\nconsider the possible work methods available and associated health and safety risks.

Skid steer\nloaders using a breaker may not be appropriate on suspended floors due to their limited reach.\nIt is important to consider the load created when large or multiple pieces of plant are used for this purpose\nto ensure a partially demolished structure can support the loads. For example, using an excavator with a\nhydraulic rock breaker or pulverising attachment to break up walls and floors while other load shifting\nequipment is used to shift the debris on a suspended floor will result in a higher load. Because of the\nweight of the plant, the vibration caused by its operation and the build-up of debris, careful design and\nplanning is needed to prevent a premature collapse of the structure.\nDemolition of walls\nWhen mobile plant, for example an excavator with a hydraulic rock breaker, is used to demolish walls, at\nleast 900 mm of the wall being demolished should be left intact above the floor level to provide a\nprotective barrier at the perimeter of the building and around lift wells, stairwells, light wells and other\nplaces where persons or objects could fall. The remaining wall can later be safely demolished from the\nfloor below. Remaining sections of walls should be identified and highlighted as buffers for edge\nprotection.\nGuarding, hoarding and/or exclusion zones should be used to protect workers and/or the public against\nthe risk of being struck by falling debris and materials.\nWalls should not be laterally loaded by accumulated rubble or debris to the extent they are in danger of\ncollapse.\nUsing plant and attachments\nPlant attachments should be pinned and secured as per the manufacturer’s requirements. The plant fittings\nused in demolition should be designed and fit for purpose. To avoid damaging the equipment itself and to\nprevent the risk of plant overturning, equipment should not be overloaded.\nWhen plant is used to demolish vertical features, including columns or walls, the columns or walls should\nnot be so high as to create a risk of debris falling onto the plant or operator.\nA member to be severed, with grapples, shears, pulverising attachments or other means should either be\neffectively supported or, if allowed to fall will not endanger persons or plant or damage the remaining\nstructure.\nExclusion zones should be established where necessary to protect the safety of people who are working\non or in the vicinity of the demolition work. No person should be in an area near the mechanical demolition\nwhere there is a possibility of being struck by flying debris.

This\nmay involve removal of framework members and the partial cutting of loadbearing members. This pre-\nweakening should be carefully planned so, despite the pre-weakening, the remaining structure has\nsufficient strength to withstand wind or impact loads until the actual collapse is initiated.\nDead load can be reduced systematically by removing surplus material, machinery, roofs, cladding, walls\nand parts of floors before demolishing the structural frame.\nSometimes heavy loads are left at height to induce the collapse of the structure after movement is\ninitiated. If this system is adopted, it should be carefully analysed and documented by a competent person,\nfor example a structural engineer to avoid premature collapse.\nWire rope, slings and chain pulling\nIf using wire rope, slings and chain pulling to demolish a structure, the pulling medium should be a securely\nanchored winch or plant designed for towing and heavy enough to apply the required tension without\nsliding or lifting from the surface on which it is located.\nThe wire rope, sling or chain should be long enough to ensure the horizontal distance from the demolition\nwork to the pulling medium is at least twice the height of the highest part to be pulled. No person should\nbe in a position where they could be struck by the wire rope, sling or chain in the event of a failure. The\nplant operator should be protected from rope breakage and flying debris. Exclusion zones should be\nestablished where necessary to protect the safety of people who are working on or in the vicinity of the\ndemolition work.\nBefore pulling of a wall commences, the wall should be cut into appropriate sections having regard to their\nheight, width and construction. If it is not possible to isolate these sections, the chains or wire ropes should\nbe attached to their respective sections prior to the first pull being made. The free ends of the chains or\nropes should be left a safe distance from the structure.

An appropriate demolition\nmethod and sequence should be selected and documented prior to the work commencing. A demolition\nplan and an assessment by a competent person of the proposed demolition method may assist with this\nprocess. A person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) carrying out this work must ensure that a\nSWMS is prepared where structural elements are to be demolished.\nPre and post-tensioned concrete\nPre-tensioned concrete contains tendons such as wires, strands or bars that have been tensioned before\nthe concrete is placed.\nPost-tensioned concrete contains tendons that have been tensioned after the concrete has hardened.\nTensioned tendons require controlled removal because the high level of potential energy stored in the\ntendons poses a risk to the health and safety of workers and can cause damage to property. It is also\nimportant to retain structural stability during and after tendon removal, prior to the final demolition of the\nconcrete element.\nThe tendons can be subject to corrosion that weakens them and decreases the structural integrity of the\nbuilding. Damage is not usually evident externally, even if strand breakage is extensive, and conditions can\nvary widely even within an individual structure.\nBefore demolishing pre or post-tensioned concrete elements, review all available documentation on the\nbuilding or structure including:\n• building plans, designs and specifications—to understand the type of tensioning used, the load\ncarried, anchorage points and number of tendons, and", "text_len": 3295, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
