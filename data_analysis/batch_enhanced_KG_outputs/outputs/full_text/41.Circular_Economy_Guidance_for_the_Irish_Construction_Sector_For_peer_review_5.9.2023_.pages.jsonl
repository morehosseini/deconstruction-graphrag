According to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage\nEmbodied Carbon in the Built Environment October 2022 this sector accounts for 37% of all emissions\nin Ireland and the continuation of these greenhouse gas emissions at the same rate is unsustainable.\nIn addition to these environmental impacts, according to the IGBC, the construction and demolition\nprojects are also responsible for about 50% of all material extraction, 33% of potable water usage and\n50% of the total waste (by weight) generated in Ireland. According to EPA 2022, National Waste\nStatistics Summary Report for 2021, 85% of C&D resources and waste was backfilled, 10% was sent\nfor disposal, with only 8% being recycled. This presents serious environmental challenges during the\nentire lifecycle of buildings and infrastructure, especially during the operational and end-of-life stages.\nIt is concerning to note that the EPA Demolition Waste Statistics for Ireland, released on 10th August\n2023 with the Latest Reference Year 2021, indicates that the quantity of Construction and Demolition\n(C&D) waste generated and collected in Ireland in 2021 increased to 9 million tonnes from 8.2 million\ntonnes in 2020, an increase of 10%.\nGiven these critical environmental concerns, the construction industry faces urgent pressure to\ntransition from the prevailing linear model to a circular economy approach. Embracing circular\neconomy thinking entails extending the lifecycles of components, materials, and products through\npractices such as reuse, repair, recycling, remanufacture, maintenance and refurbishment. While\ncircular economy concepts have proven successful in various sectors like electrical equipment, their\napplication in the construction industry is relatively recent and has primarily focused on waste\nprevention and material management. Opportunities are presented to designers of buildings,\ninfrastructure, and construction products to increase circularity through design for adaptability and\ndesign for disassembly and reuse. New business models will be required to bring about the changes\nrequired to reduce resource consumption.\n4", "text_len": 2675, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Nonetheless, the sector's entrenched project-based institutional practices\nand market mechanisms often hinder the seamless integration of circular economy principles. With\nnumerous stakeholders contributing to the environmental impacts and costs throughout the supply\nchain, both government and businesses can lead in guiding and supporting a circular economy\ntransition within the construction industry through relevant guidelines and policy interventions.\nThis guidance document is the first step in envisioning a thriving Irish construction sector, fully\nembracing circular economy principles that maintain products, components, and materials at their\nhighest use and value throughout their lifecycle. It aims to set out the necessary actions to replace the\nlinear construction sector economy, characterised by a take-make-dispose approach, with a circular\none that focuses on reducing the extraction of natural resources, recovery retention, refurbishment,\nremanufacturing, and reutilisation. Our future built environment and infrastructure must be designed\nto facilitate the reuse and adaptation of materials. Businesses should find value in reusing, recovering\nand remanufacturing products or salvaging parts and materials to bring benefit to clients and end\nusers.\nThe guidance document is structured in three sections, with Section 1 looking at economic impact of\nthe circular economy in construction, Section 2 setting out the approach to delivering our vision while\nSection 3 focuses on the vision, challenges, and solutions to implementing the circular economy in\nconstruction and the built environment across Design, Planning, Procurement, Manufacturing of\nConstruction Products, Construction, Operations and Use, Reuse and Retrofit and Demolition.\nWorking with a group of experts from industry, government departments and agencies, local\nauthorities, NGOs, academia, and others who possess extensive knowledge and expertise in resource\nuse and waste within the construction sector has been a privilege. My sincere thanks is extended to\nthe dedicated team that has diligently crafted this excellent guidance document and a full list of\ncontributors is set out in the Acknowledgements section.\nLooking ahead, the construction sector is poised for transformation, driven by early moves to\ndigitalisation and offsite manufacturing, which promise greater productivity, new skills, reduced\ncarbon footprint, support of circularity and expanded business opportunities.

Designing\ndurable and adaptable buildings and infrastructure and maintaining a digital memory of their\ncomposition and maintenance will facilitate end-of-life decisions on materials' reuse, recycling, or\nrecovery. Holistic life cycle assessments will underpin the interplay between material choices, carbon\nreduction, durability, and adaptability, ultimately leading to more sustainable outcomes.\nThis guidance document will be helpful to all participants and practitioners in the Irish design,\nmanufacturing, construction, demolition and resource and waste management, built environment\nasset management sectors and to educators as it is providing guidance for the transition from current\npractice to circular practice and sets out the actions required in the education, value chain, research\nand development, digital delivery areas to achieve this transition.\nIt will also be valuable to policy makers in highlighting the many aspects of policy and regulation which\nneed to be addressed to eliminate many roadblocks certain barriers and to support the transition of\nthe construction sector to the circular economy model.\nIt is anticipated that this guidance document will be followed by CircularBuild which is an EPA-funded\nproject, which aims at developing and designing the National Circular Built Environment Roadmap to\n2040. The project lead, the Irish Green Building Council, in collaboration with Atlantic Technological\nUniversity, Technological University Dublin and the University of Galway, will be broadly dedicated in\ndefining and exploiting Circularity in the Irish Construction sector, an engaging process, with\nstakeholders from different backgrounds and expertise in the four key circular areas of the\nConstruction sector. This will be carried out through dedicated workshops and a public consultation\nprocess, before the roadmap is prepared, and is being launched in September 2023.\nThe successful implementation and embedding of circular economy principles into the Irish\nconstruction sector necessitate unprecedented collaboration across value chains and government\ndepartments. This guidance document’s development has been characterised by a highly\ncollaborative process that transcends traditional silos and incorporates key stakeholders from central\nand local government, government agencies, NGOs, academia and the construction industry. Drawing\non best practices from both national and international contexts, the guidance\ndocument encompasses key initiatives essential for driving the construction sector circular economy\nvision.\n6", "text_len": 2689, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

It is based on three principles, driven by design: eliminate waste and pollu/on,\ncirculate products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerate nature. It is underpinned by\na transi/on to renewable energy and materials.\nTransi/oning to a circular economy entails decoupling economic ac/vity from the consump/on of\nfinite resources. This represents a systemic ship that builds long-term resilience, generates business\nand economic opportuni/es, and provides environmental and societal benefits.”\nWhat is a circular economy in the built environment?\nAccording to the EPA, in the circular economy system, we use less raw material, we design products\nfor long-life and recyclability, we share products, we use them for longer and we reuse and repair\nthings before we recycle or throw them away.11 The European Parliament further describes a circular\neconomy as: “a model of produc/on and consump/on, which involves sharing, leasing, reusing,\nrepairing, refurbishing, and recycling exis/ng materials and products as long as possible. In this way,\nthe life cycle of products is extended. In prac/ce, it implies reducing waste to a minimum. When a\nproduct reaches the end of its life, its materials are kept within the economy wherever possible. These\ncan be produc/vely used again and again, thereby crea/ng further value.”12\nA circular economy is a systemic approach to economic development designed to benefit businesses,\nsociety, and the environment. In contrast to the ‘take-make-dispose’ linear economy, a circular\neconomy is based on three principles i.e. (1) to design out waste and pollu/on, (2) keeping the\nproducts and materials in use and, (3) to regenerate natural systems.13\n10 EMF, Finding a Common Language – The Circular Economy Glossary\nhttps://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/news/finding-a-common-language-circular-economy-glossary-launched\n11 EPA Ireland, “What is the circular economy?” https://www.epa.ie/environment-and-you/circular-economy/\n12 European Parliament, “Circular economy: definition, importance and benefits” May 2023\nhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/economy/20151201STO05603/circular-economy-\ndefinition-importance-and-benefits\n13 Ellen Mac Arthur Foundation, “What is a Circular Economy?”\nhttps://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/circular-economy-introduction/overview.\n14", "text_len": 2621, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Making our existing building and infrastructure stock more circular, through renovation,\nadaptation etc. In simple terms maximising the existing asset value and extending the\nfunctional life;\n2. Designing new buildings and infrastructure to be as circular as possible.\nThis is achieved as follows:14\n• The smaller the loop (activity-wise and geographically), the more profitable and resource\nefficient it is.\n• Loops have no beginning and no end.\n• The speed of the circular flows is crucial: The efficiency of managing stock in the circular\neconomy increases with a decreasing flow speed.\n• Continued ownership is cost-effective: Reuse, repair and remanufacture without a change of\nownership saves double transaction.\n• A circular economy needs functioning markets.\nFigure 1: Circular Economy Principles15\n14 McDonough.com, “Cradle to Cradle,” William McDonough & Michael Braungart, 2002.\nhttps://mcdonough.com/cradle-to-cradle/\n15 WGBC, “The Circular Built Environment Playbook,” 2023. https://worldgbc.org/article/circular-built-\nenvironment-playbook/\n15", "text_len": 1218, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

In\nconstruc/ng them we must make considered material choices to reuse for as long as possible materials\nand components, to use renewable materials and energy to allow for environmental sustainability and\nto design out and to reduce raw material resources, reduce consump/on and prevent waste from\ndesign stage. Examining life cycles may make recircula/on easier, ensure minimal loss of material\nresources and maximise the overall number of use-lives for any given material, including poten/ally\nindefinite reuse.\nEmbracing circular principles means resources are kept in use for as long as possible, crea/ng a closed-\nloop system that minimises waste and maximizes the value of resources, so that that future\nconstruc/on and infrastructure ac/vi/es and materials we choose are re-usable, repairable and\nrecyclable. The selected resources and materials should remove toxicity from our built environment,\nminimise import of materials, focus on locally sourced materials and use reversable connec/ons\nbetween buildings, infrastructure and the built environment to facilitate reuse.\nAll stakeholders should fully embrace circular design processes and procurement at the beginning of\nthe design stage of any building, infrastructure or built environment construc/on project. The Irish\nGovernment as the country’s largest construc/on client should require implementa/on of circular\neconomy principles, including by Local Authori/es in their role as planners and clients. Circularity\nshould influence all the stages of the life cycle, from the tendering, design, planning, building,\nmaintenance, use and re-use.\nThese principles should extend through the life of all design and construc/on ac/vity with built\nenvironment assets through designing for circular use, retrofiung and renova/ons.\nPersistent Organic Pollutants (POPS) so called due to their persistent, bio-accumula/ve and toxic\nproper/es need to be considered at all phases of a circular construc/on project but par/cularly at\ndesign and demoli/on phases to ensure minimal exposure to POPS.\n16", "text_len": 2480, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The Montreal Design\nDeclara/on defines design as “the applica/on of intent: the process through which we create the\nmaterial, spa/al, visual and experien/al environments in a world made ever more malleable by\nadvances in technology and materials, and increasingly vulnerable to the effects of unleashed global\ndevelopment.”16\nPut another way, design is the way we create products, services and systems, and is the mechanism\nby which we shape the material environment around us to meet our needs and desires.\nCrucially, when something is designed, important decisions are made that impact how it is\nmanufactured, how it is used, and what happens when it is no longer needed or wanted. It is\nexceedingly difficult to go back and undo the effects of those decisions if they are later found to\nproduce undesirable consequences.\nThe Whole of Government Circular Economy Strategy 2022 - 2023 Living More, Using Less report\ncommits to significantly reduce Ireland’s circularity gap, in both absolute terms and in comparison,\nwith other EU Member States, so that Ireland’s circularity rate is above the EU average by 2030.17\n16 Design Declaration, “Montreal Design Declaration,” Design Declaration Summit, 2017.\nhttp://www.designdeclaration.org/declaration/.\n17 Whole of Government Circular Economy Strategy 2022 – 2023 'Living More, Using Less'\nhttps://www.gov.ie/en/publication/b542d-whole-of-government-circular-economy-strategy-2022-2023-\nliving-more-using-less/\n17", "text_len": 1683, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The EPA is preparing guidance on reuse which shall include a chapter dedicated to the\nconstruc/on and demoli/on sector. This should serve as a useful tool to support industry in\ndetermining their legisla/ve requirements in this regard.\nA by-product is a material which is produced as an indirect consequence of a produc/on process i.e.,\nthe main aim of the produc/on process was not to produce that material. Construc/on and/or\ndemoli/on can be considered as a produc/on process from which by-products can be produced. In\norder to be considered a by-product, certain condi/ons as set out in Regula/on 27 of the European\nUnion (Waste Direc/ve) Regula/ons 2011-2020 must be fulfilled. A by-product must be no/fied to the\nEPA on a single-case base for determina/on, or if associated European level criteria or Na/onal criteria\nexist, it must be registered on the EPA website.\nIf a material is discarded or intended to be discarded, then it is considered a waste. To be able to reuse\na waste material, it must be reclassified as a product by achieving end-of-waste status. End-of-waste\nstatus can be achieved through compliance with European level criteria or Na/onal criteria, where\npublished, or on a single-case basis through applica/on to the EPA for a decision under Regula/on 28\nof the European Union (Waste Direc/ve) Regula/ons 2011-2020.

These criteria will ul/mately eliminate the need for mul/ple single-\ncase decisions for those materials.\nWhat are the current challenges?\nAchieving these goals requires stakeholders, including construc/on professionals, to overcome the\nfollowing challenges:\nWe need to consider how businesses involved in manufacturing construc/on materials quan/fy or\naccount for the longer-term value of the resources they put on the market. Both business and\nconsumers need to know that they can track the value and how they are rewarded for that value. We\nneed bemer informa/on to answer whether their customers are interested in or aware of the\ndifferences or benefits of more circular produc/on.\nOne of the challenges includes difficul/es in puung innova/ve, circular products on the Irish market.\nThere needs to be a clear pathway for manufacturers of innova/ve, circular products to help them\nlaunch new products in Ireland. Required cer/fica/on and other alterna/ve routes to put innova/ve\nproducts on the market must be clearly defined. The current Agrément cer/fica/on assessment does\nnot cover the sustainability and circularity of the cer/fied product. Environmental Product\nDeclara/ons may go some way to addressing those issues; however, they are voluntary.\nMany new solu/ons and innova/ons s/ll need to be developed for high-quality recycling and reuse of\nmaterials, sustainable produc/on, and service-life extension of materials. While the EPA have excluded\nstructural applica/ons from the scope of the upcoming Na/onal decision end-of-waste decision for\nrecycled aggregates, they have stated that they would however support and steer industry to build on\nthe criteria already developed to establish na/onal-criteria for structural uses.\nWe need to find measures to overcome the reluctance of companies to provide more sustainable\nmanufacturing process due to their lack of knowledge or addi/onal upfront manufacturing cost, and\nin parallel develop a market demand for these products.\n27 By-products Regulation 27, https://www.epa.ie/our-services/licensing/waste/by-products-regulation-27/\n28 End-of-waste criteria in Ireland, Levels of end-of-waste criteria, https://www.epa.ie/our-\nservices/licensing/waste/end-of-waste-art-28/end-of-waste-criteria-in-ireland/\n51", "text_len": 2633, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Currently, there is no requirement to provide\nthird-party verified environmental performance metrics. This can lead to confusion among businesses\nabout which construc/on material products are genuinely circular. Producers who take the bold steps\nand ini/a/ve to publish an EPD openly are not necessarily rewarded with more business, so they might\nbe disincen/vised.

It should be mandatory learning. This\nshould be addressed by Construct Innovate, which was established last year to bring tes/ng facili/es\nand universi/es together.31\nWhat are our proposed solu:ons?\nManufacturing construc/on products can generally be seen as a series of internal economies within\nthe construc/on sector. Many manufacturers are already very efficient and have very limle waste\narising within their own produc/on facili/es. Much of construc/on waste arises later in the supply\nchain and on construc/on sites. Each producer should endeavour to control what they can as a star/ng\npoint by, for example, seung annualised targets on waste reduc/on. This might eventually be in the\nform of publicly published waste data but beginning with internal repor/ng and measurement. Grants\nshould then be offered to those manufacturers to develop innova/ve processes that first minimise\nwaste, and, secondly, maximise the use of any remaining construc/on and demoli/on resources and\nwaste internally. Local support networks should be encouraged to develop crea/ve solu/ons that\ncould then see one manufacturer’s waste become another manufacturer’s raw material; for example,\n/mber processing waste into insula/on materials.\nBio-based materials are, one of a number of product solu/ons, which require par/cular amen/on as\ntheir impact extends beyond the circular economy. Bio-based building materials have poten/al to\nreduce the embodied carbon footprint of new buildings and refurbishments. The produc/on of such\nmaterials must be subject to robust assessment under e.g., the WWF GWPbio biogenic assessment\ntool (with all advanced data profiles completed), or similar, to ensure that any carbon savings are\nverifiable and auditable. The impacts on land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) should also\nbe included in such an assessment. This will also enable the quan/fica/on of any biogenic carbon\ncapture and storage possible as a result of the switch to bio-based building materials use. Given the\ndynamics of the economic impacts, any biogenic carbon advantage will need to be mapped for each\nbio-based material for the years from 2025 to 2050 compared to their decarbonising compe/tor\nmaterials over the same period to inform the economic cost-benefit and the carbon cost-benefit that\nmay accrue in any switch from mineral to bio-based building material use.\nIn order to fully co-ordinate and facilitate the development of new sustainable products to meet the\nneed of a decarbonised construc/on industry, Enterprise Ireland should be tasked with seung up a\n31 Construct Innovate: Ireland’s National Research Centre for Construction Technology and Innovation\nhttps://constructinnovate.ie/\n53", "text_len": 2804, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

It is administered by the Department of Housing, Local\nGovernment, and Heritage and is overseen by local authori/es across the country. The planning system\naims to ensure that development occurs in a coordinated and sustainable manner, taking into account\nfactors such as environmental protec/on, infrastructure provision, economic development, and the\noverall well-being of communi/es.\nKey features of the planning system include:\nDevelopment Plans: These are long-term strategic plans created by local authori/es, outlining their\nvision for the development and land use of the area. They address issues like housing, transporta/on,\nameni/es, and environmental protec/on.\nZoning and Land Use: The planning system designates different zones for various types of\ndevelopment, such as residen/al, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and conserva/on areas. Zoning\nregula/ons determine what can be built where and to what extent.\nPlanning Permission: Developers and property owners typically need planning permission before\ncarrying out certain types of development or making significant changes to exis/ng structures. This\nprocess involves submiung plans and informa/on to the local authority for approval.\nEnvironmental Considera?ons: The planning system currently takes environmental factors into\naccount, including the protec/on of natural habitats, historic sites, and landscapes. Environmental\nImpact Assessments (EIAs) whether undertaken by the applicant or the local authority are open\nrequired for projects.\nPublic Par?cipa?on: Public par/cipa/on is encouraged in the planning process. Local authori/es open\nseek input from residents, community groups, and other stakeholders before making decisions on\ndevelopment proposals.\nAppeals and Enforcement: There are mechanisms for both appealing planning decisions and enforcing\nplanning regula/ons. Appeals are typically made to an independent body, such as An Bord Pleanála.\n57", "text_len": 2136, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
