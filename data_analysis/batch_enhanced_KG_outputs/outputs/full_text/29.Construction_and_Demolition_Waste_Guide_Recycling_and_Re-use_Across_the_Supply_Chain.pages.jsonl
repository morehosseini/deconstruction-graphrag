They have an environmental impact at every step of the\nbuilding process—extraction of raw materials, processing, manufacturing, transportation,\nconstruction and disposal at the end of a building’s useful life.\nFigure 1 - A simplistic perspective on the building supply chain\nGovernments worldwide have responded to the need to reduce waste with regulation and\nlegislation that have framed a market for building materials and products derived from the\nconstruction and demolition (C&D) waste stream.\nThere are now, more than ever, clear opportunities for business and industry to invest in\nactivities that will create profit and improve environmental outcomes by extracting valuable\nresources from the C&D waste stream.\nThe built environment of the future is being constructed at the beginning of a new ecological\nera where governments are framing markets with regulation and legislation that respond to the\nchallenges of environmental sustainability, and where industry must respond to the challenges\nof low-carbon economies and resource depletion.\nBusinesses that are profiting and growing are adapting to these new challenges and\nresponding with innovations that turn waste into valuable resources to supply the\nconstruction industry, which has traditionally been adverse to behavioural change.\nThis guide outlines the opportunities available for effective markets and presents\n15 initiatives where companies are profiting and growing while contributing to a\nmore ecologically sustainable built environment.\nAim of the guide\nThe aim of this guide is to help develop effective markets for materials diverted or derived from\nthe C&D waste stream.\n4 | Construction and demolition waste guide", "text_len": 1834, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Of this, 42 per cent was\nfrom the C&D waste stream.\nIn 2004–05 C&D waste generation in Australia (The Blue Book—Australian Waste Industry,\n2008, p. 8) was 15.1 million tonnes, of which 7.6 million tonnes was recycled materials (timber,\nsteel, concrete, rubble and soil) and 7.5 million tonnes was residual waste to landfill. In\n2006–07, 43 777 000 tonnes of waste was generated, 38 per cent of which was from the C&D\nstream.\nBuildings and their users are responsible for almost a quarter of Australia’s greenhouse\nemissions. The energy embodied in existing building stock in Australia is equivalent to ten years\nof the nation’s energy consumption. Choice of materials and design principles has a significant,\nbut previously unrecognised, impact on the energy required to construct a building. Embodied\nenergy is one measure of the environmental impact of construction and of the effectiveness of\nrecycling, particularly for CO emissions. The embodied energy of a building is over 30 times\n2\nthe annual operating energy of office buildings. Making buildings more energy efficient usually\nrequires more embodied energy, thus increasing the ratio even further (CSIRO Material Science\nand Engineering, 2009).\nThe contribution that the re-use and recycling industry can make to lower the embodied impacts\nof buildings is significant. Communicating the benefits of re-use and recycling and highlighting\nhow barriers have been overcome will help to address the misperception that re-use of C&D\nwaste in infrastructure is novel, difficult and risky. This will stimulate greater re-use and recycling\nof C&D waste across the supply chain.\nGrocon’s Pixel Building; an example of a new breed of innovative buildings, contributing to a\nbuilt environment for the ecological era.\n5", "text_len": 2338, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Through the National Waste\nPolicy, the Australian Government aims to support development of best practice across all\nstates and territories. The policy includes a strategy specifically focussed on C&D waste,\nas follows:\nStrategy 11: All governments continue to encourage best practice waste management and\nresource recovery for construction and demolition projects.\nAustralian Government approach\nAustralian Government waste legislation\nThe Australian Government does not directly legislate management of C&D waste. The\nmanagement of environmental issues, including all waste streams, is largely the responsibility\nof Australian state and territory governments. Exceptions to this general principle are where\ninternational treaties are involved (for example, the Basel Convention on the Control of\nTransboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal) or developments\nthat are deemed to be of significant environmental importance to the nation.\nWaste management and resource recovery in Australia is dependent on the regulatory\nframework of the states and territories. Because of this, the approach commonly adopted\nby the Australian Government is one of multi-stakeholder engagement and multi-party\nagreements. These may be underpinned by legislative measures where all parties support\nthe need for fall-back legislation at a jurisdictional level (The Blue Book—Australian Waste\nIndustry, 2007–08 Industry Market Report).\n6 | Construction and demolition waste guide", "text_len": 2100, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

As described in Table 1,\nstate and territory governments are responsible for regulating waste issues. However,\nregulation and legislation only set minimum standards. To increase the rates of recycling\nand re-use of C&D waste, new materials and products must be derived, applications for these\nmaterials proven, and markets created. In some cases there are significant technical barriers—\nindustry is required to invest in innovation, research and development to create new processes\nand products that can be sold into the building supply chain. This can take significant effort and\noften involves business risk. Regulation and legislation alone will never be enough to achieve\nthe required amounts of C&D waste recovery. Regulation and legislation play a key role in\nsetting minimum standards, but other initiatives are required to drive innovation and industry-led\nactivities.\nIndustry self-regulation\nIndustry self-regulation is a powerful factor driving the development of new materials\nderived from C&D waste and the use of these products in construction. Many associations in\nthe building products and materials industry are investing in initiatives to help their member\ncompanies achieve better production and consumption outcomes by ‘doing more with less’.\nDelivering improved materials and products to the construction companies, in turn, helps\nthem to achieve green ratings. Green ratings for buildings are well established now—few new\ncommercial buildings are designed and built without a green building rating. Similarly, a green\nrating scheme for infrastructure is under development and will be delivered in 2011.\nThe building Roadmap with its complete external environment (TEC, 2009)\n8 | Construction and demolition waste guide", "text_len": 1822, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

In many sectors industries have,\nor are developing, voluntary product stewardship schemes.\nProduct stewardship recognises everyone involved in the production, supply and use of\nproducts, sharing responsibility for the environmental impacts throughout a product’s life—from\nproduction through to disposal. It aims to reduce hazardous substances, avoid and reduce\nwaste, and increase recycling and resource recovery. To date, product stewardship schemes\nhave been driven by industry and are voluntary— several leading initiatives described in the\ncase studies in this guide are driven by industry product stewardship schemes.\nGovernments are supporting manufacturers and importers of products in these efforts. On\n8 August 2011 the Product Stewardship Act 2011 came into effect. This legislation provides\nthe framework to effectively manage the environmental, health and safety impacts of products,\nparticularly impacts associated with the disposal of products. The framework includes\nvoluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship. The Act fulfils a commitment by\nthe Australian Government under the National Waste Policy, heralding a new, efficient and\nenvironmentally responsible approach to waste management in Australia.\nGreen Building Council of Australia’s Green Star building rating tools\nThe Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA) is a national, not-for-profit organisation that\nhas been driving sustainable outcomes in the property sector since 2002. The GBCA have\ndeveloped a suite of Green Star tools that rate the sustainability of buildings, including materials\nused in construction and fit-out, and C&D waste reduction credits. Several of the case studies\nin this guide cite Green Star as a driver for their activities and two (commercial buildings) have\nGreen Star ratings.\nThe complexity of the Green Star tools has increased since their inception. In February\n2011 the GBCA made a commitment to a life cycle approach in rating building products and\nmaterials. This will encourage industry to research and develop products with lower embodied\nimpacts and will contribute to the reduction of C&D waste.\nAustralian Green Infrastructure Council rating tool\nThe Australian Green Infrastructure Council (AGIC), a member-based industry association\nestablished in 2008, has been developing a green rating tool for infrastructure. Like the\nGBCA’s building rating tool, the AGIC tool will rate aspects of infrastructure and includes a\ncategory for materials selection and use. This category gives credit for materials that have\nlow embodied impacts relative to a standard. The materials selection and use category will\ntake a life cycle approach to rating materials—the AGIC tool will rigorously measure a suite\nof environmental impacts embodied within the materials and give the material a rating. If\nthe material demonstrates lower embodied impacts than its alternative it will be awarded\npoints towards an aggregated score (like Green Star for buildings).

It is hoped that it will be as successful\nas the Green Star tools have been for buildings, and that it will drive markets for recycled and\nre-used materials.\nEconomics\nDuring the research for this guide, many stakeholders have cited the cost of landfill as\na significant driver for re-use and recycling of C&D waste. In 2009 the Commonwealth\npublished a report that identified that landfill costs in Australia ranged from $42 per tonne to\n$102 per tonne. In addition to the cost of land-filling by operators, there can be an additional\ncharge levied by the state and territory jurisdictions. In New South Wales for example, the\ngovernment’s Section 88 Landfill Levy applies to regulated areas, and ranges between\n$20.40 per tonne and $70 per tonne. The lower limit is set to rise by $10 (plus adjustment\nfor the consumer price index) per year until 2015–16. It is expected that this will drive\nadditional re-use and recycling from the construction industry.\nThere is uncertainty around the cost implications of a carbon tax; however it is certain that\nenergy costs are rising significantly regardless. These rising costs will directly impact the cost\nof building materials and products. Reusing and recycling C&D waste will in most cases reduce\nthe embodied energy of production, and this will be reflected in the price of products and\nmaterials sourced from C&D waste.\nThe building supply chain\nThe building supply chain is sophisticated and involves myriad stakeholders each playing their\npart in the delivery of buildings. The material considerations are implicit across the supply chain\nas stakeholders play out their roles in delivering a sustainable built environment. This guide is\ndesigned to cut through the complexity of the supply chain, and help the growing C&D re-use\nand recycling industry to identify opportunities to supply materials.\nTo fully realise the opportunities of integrating new materials and products derived from C&D\nwaste, it is important to focus on the earliest stages of the building supply chain—the earliest\nstages of design is where the greatest opportunities to affect sustainable outcomes are, as\nillustrated in Figure 4.\nThe supply of new materials derived from C&D waste must be publicised, the products\nspecified clearly in terms of their fitness for purpose and how they can be used, and\nindustry educated to adapt and learn how to use new materials.\n10 | Construction and demolition waste guide", "text_len": 2753, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Industrial ecology promotes enhanced sustainability and resource\nefficiency by stimulating innovations in the re-use of waste materials. The wastes or by-products\nof one industry are used as inputs in another industry, thereby closing the material loop of\nindustrial systems and minimising waste.\nThe Waste Management Association of Australia (WMAA), supported by funding from the\nNew South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage, set up an organisation in 2009 called\nthe Australasian Industrial Ecology Network. This group has been working to promote\nawareness of industrial ecology, and the opportunities that it creates, through industry events\nand, more recently, industry workshops where manufacturers can exchange by-products with\neach other, saving landfill costs and offsetting raw material costs. These workshops have been\nheld in New South Wales and Melbourne and are sponsored by state and local governments\nto catalyse innovation and resource efficiency outcomes in their areas. These workshops have\nbeen referred to as ‘speed-dating workshops’ as the focus is on finding an industry match.\nOften there is a need to change manufacturing processes. Support for this is available through\nthe Australasian Industrial Ecology Network.\nNational Industrial Symbiosis Programme (United Kingdom)\nIn 2003 the United Kingdom (UK) Government funded trials of industrial ecology projects.\nThe achievements of these projects in 2004 were outlined in a brochure called the\nNational Industrial Symbiosis Programme: a year of achievement. In 2005 the\nUK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs injected government funding into\nwhat became The National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP). By October 2009 NISP\nhad made a significant contribution to reducing UK carbon emissions and had boosted the\nUK’s economy by between £1.5 billion to £2.5 billion (A$3 billion to A$5 billion). NISP works\non the simple principle of matching companies which have a by-product with companies\nwhich can use that by-product. In turn this achieves business cost reduction through avoided\nwaste and more cost-effective raw materials. The environment benefits due to less landfill,\nraw material extraction and carbon savings. NISP offers Australia a model for the future which\nAustralia has already begun to emulate.\n11", "text_len": 2464, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The C&D waste\nstream usually covers only some of the generation, disposal and recycling of C&D wastes, as\nthese materials can also be found in the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and Commercial and\nIndustrial (C&I) streams, or as hazardous wastes.\nThere are many opportunities to extract value from the C&D waste stream as described within\nthe material profiles below.\nConstruction and demolition recycling and re-use—industry standard\npractice\nRe-use and recycling of some materials and resources is becoming industry standard practice.\nFor example, landfill charges provide an incentive for high recycling rates of massive materials,\nsuch as masonry materials (asphalt, bricks and concrete). Reclamation rates for high-value\nmaterials, such as metals and hardwood timbers, have also increased.\nMaterial profiles\nThe Australian Government recently carried out a study to determine the status of C&D\nrecycling and re-use in Australia. The following sections detail the opportunities for recycling\nand re-use of C&D materials in Australia.\nThe level of recovery of a material stream and market demand for associated products is\nrelated to geography and pricing. Materials that are heavy and generated in large volumes cost\nmore to dispose of to landfill, especially where there is an appropriate disposal pricing structure,\nwhich may include an associated levy. This results in these materials receiving priority attention\nfor recovery and market development in the C&D sector. These materials, such as metals and\nmasonry, are mostly generated from the commercial demolition sector and civil activities such\nas pavement maintenance or site excavation works.\n12 | Construction and demolition waste guide", "text_len": 2217, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Where high landfill fees exist (including levies), there is a strong incentive\nto avoid weight-based disposal charges by recovering the heavy components of the C&D waste\nstream. Diversion also supports significant end markets for the recycled products in some\nmetropolitan locations, where reprocessing sites can produce products that are commercially\ncompetitive with quarry products.\nBricks are often presented as ‘mixed masonry’ or ‘builders rubble’ mixed with concrete and,\nlike source-separated concrete, this component of the C&D waste stream is relatively simple\nto process, with similar end markets for aggregate products.\nThe key markets for crushed concrete and brick include use in all-weather applications (such as\nlow-grade roads), and in pavement sub-bases (such as roads and non-structural applications)\nas a substitute for virgin crushed rock.\nThe advantage of recycled crushed concrete was highlighted as being associated with physical\nproperties. This suggests that for the same product weight as certain crushed quarry rock, the\ncrushed concrete alternative offered an additional 10–15 per cent product volume.\nAsphalt\nAsphalt material is generated through the civil road construction sector. Asphalt is potentially\n100 per cent recyclable. This level of recycling and use of recycled content in pavements has\nnot been fully realised in Australia, however there are efforts to improve this within the industry.\nAsphalt pavements on average are 4 per cent bitumen and 96 per cent aggregate. Generally\nthe top layer of asphalt, known as the wearing course (which is generally between 25–40mm),\nis removed and re-laid every 10 to 15 years. This is done using a milling machine, which\nremoves the wearing course.

While the price that\nre-processors pay for mixed steel scrap is highly variable, the current ballpark figure is around\n$250 per tonne. Coupled with the value of avoided landfill disposal costs, there is a strong\neconomic incentive to recover this material stream.\nThe majority (about 90 per cent) of metals recovered from the C&D sector comes from\ncommercial demolition sites. Of this material, up to 95 per cent is steel and the remaining\nmaterials (about 5 per cent) are non-ferrous metals. This non-ferrous component mostly\nincludes aluminium (1 to 2 per cent), stainless steel and copper piping or wire. Ferrous metals\nlike steel can be easily recovered from the waste stream using relatively inexpensive magnets.\nTimber\nMost timber is generated from the demolition sector, and nationally there is lower market\ndemand for recovered timber compared to other components of the C&D waste stream.\nThere is a high-value market for the re-use of quality hardwood timber, with prices over $1000\nper cubic metre for some high-grade Australian timbers, although the volume of material\nrecovered is relatively low. Nationally, the market for re-use of timber is estimated to be around\n60 000 cubic metres.\nIndications from industry are that the salvage market for reusable timber is generally functioning\nwell due to the potential for high economic returns. A barrier to growing the re-use market is the\nincreasing mechanisation of demolition works (primarily due to time pressures and occupational\nhealth and safety requirements), which makes it more difficult for salvage operations to take\nplace, and increases the potential for high-value timbers to be damaged. Another significant\nsource of salvageable hardwood is ‘infrastructure timber’, such as power poles and railway\nsleepers, for which there is strong demand in landscaping applications.\nPlastics\nThe Plastics and Chemicals Industries Association’s (PACIA) annual recycling survey provides\na useful overview for all sectors, including C&D, for plastics recovery, recycling and market\noutlets.\nThe PACIA report highlights that the construction (or building) sector is one of the key markets\nfor plastics in Australia. The plastics used in construction fall across two distinct categories:\n(i) packaging and (ii) durables (non-packaging). This categorisation of plastics is associated\nwith the life-span of the plastic product.\nEven though there are broad applications for plastic products in construction, as outlined in\nFigure 9, the most common products are packaging films, waffle pods and pipes.\nThe PACIA study highlights that very little material is recovered from the C&D sector, but\nacknowledges that there is growing activity around recycling of used plastics from the industry.\n14 | Construction and demolition waste guide", "text_len": 2964, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For\nthis reason it is one of the most challenging materials when seeking to improve the recovery\nof mixed C&D loads, even though plasterboard itself is highly recyclable.\nMost plasterboard recovery is from construction sites and is often made through arrangements\nbetween the builder or construction company and the material manufacturer or supplier.\nPlasterboard manufacturers which supply construction sites regularly support the recovery of\nclean product from sites and support companies which purchase their materials.\nRock and excavation stone\nThis material is recovered when civil or site preparation works are undertaken. Depending on\nthe geology of an area, a great deal of excavated rock and stone can be produced as a by-\nproduct. Excavated rock and stone comes mostly from the construction sector. Again, the level\nof recovery of these materials and end markets for associated products has much to do with the\ngeography of where the material is generated, the local market outlets for products, and landfill\npricing which discourages the disposal of this heavy, voluminous material.\nSimilar to crushed concrete and brick, excavated rock and stone is a source of inexpensive\naggregate for a range of applications in pavement sub-base. In markets, like Melbourne, where\nthere are significant volumes excavated rock and stone competes with recycled C&D concrete\nand brick products.\nSoil and sand\nSoil and sand is generated from site preparation and excavation works associated with\nconstruction activities.

The product is made of a fibreglass polymer matrix backing with nylon.\nSixty-six fibres are embedded in the surface to create the carpet. Ontera implements the\nprinciple of ‘precycling’, whereby the original product is made more durable to maximise its\nfirst life to ensure that it is able to withstand additional life cycles.\nOntera guarantees to take the product back at the end of its first life for re-use or recycling at no\ncost to the customer. The tangible benefit, above the direct cost saving, is the reassurance that\nthe product is not ending its life in landfill, but entering a second life.\nUse of recycled and re-used material\nOntera’s principle is to retain the energy embodied in their products as far as possible by\nextending products’ life cycle and by not wasting the energy embodied in the products. Ontera’s\nEarthPlus® environmental program provides an option to re-use any used Ontera carpet tiles\nwithout any destructive processes or measurable additional energy input. Used Ontera carpet\ntiles can be given a second (and possibly third) life through a proprietary process that ‘super-\ncleans’ the surface, retextures it and superimposes a new design to refresh the appearance.\nThis extends the warranted life of the carpet tile by a further seven years for the same end use.\nThe EarthPlus® program is a re-use process, not a recycling process. Ontera’s studies\nhave shown this to be the most environmentally benign way to extend product life. All of the\nembodied energy used in the creation of the original product is retained, enabling the product\nlife to be significantly extended without the need for significant additional energy and resources.\nA summary of resource efficiency savings includes:\n• take-back and re-use of over 120 000 m2 (approximately 600 tonnes) of used carpet tile\n• saving of approximately 2000 litres of water per month in dye recycling\n• incorporation of post-consumer recycled component of between 5–10 per cent of the\nbacking using polymer component obtained by recycled used or waste carpet tiles\n• reduction of energy and water consumption by over 40 per cent per square metre of finished\nproduct\n• reduction of waste sent to landfill by 25 per cent\n• reduction of on-site CO emissions by over 19 per cent\n²\n• increase of recycled content in product by 50 per cent.\n19", "text_len": 2512, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Scrap generated during manufacture is routinely reground and fed\nback into the manufacturing process, and the industry is now recycling post-consumer waste\nwhere pipe is collected from the waste stream and recycled back into pipe products.\nPlastic pipes are long-life products with an expected lifespan of over 100 years. Therefore the\namount entering the waste stream is relatively small, as the products are largely still in their first\nlife cycle.\nUse of recycled and re-used material\nThe PIPA recycling scheme recycles 300–400 tonnes of demolition and offcut PVC pipe\nin Sydney and Melbourne from new construction and temporary pipe systems.\nBased on the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage’s Report into the\nConstruction and Demolition Waste Stream Audit 2000–2005, the total proportion of\nplastics in C&D waste in New South Wales was 13 000 tonnes per year out of 450 000 tonnes.\nBreakdown of the proportion of plastics beyond this was not published in the audit report due to\nthe low volume. Anecdotally, the total PVC amount is between 1000 and 3000 tonnes per year.\nThe PVC pipe waste is an undetermined proportion of this.\nDrivers for re-use\nPVC has been a controversial material over many years due to concerns over the toxicity of\nadditives such as plasticisers that give PVC its flexibility and the dioxins produced when PVC\nis burnt. The main risk of PVC being burnt is in uncontrolled landfill fires when PVC products\nreach the end of their life cycle. Avoidance of this risk is a driver for recycling and re-use of PVC\nproducts.

This\nlow volume creates scale issues for the recycling process. The cost of recycled material is the\nsame as virgin material. This is mostly due to the cost of transporting materials to the recycling\nfacility. The industry needs greater scale or a higher value for PVC to incentivise more PVC\nrecycling. The industry is working with a small number of recyclers to concentrate volumes into\nviable quantities.\nEnsuring the recycled material is free of contaminants such as dirt and fixings is an issue which\nis being addressed by industry efforts to source the material before it becomes co-mingled with\nother building and demolition waste. The use of washing facilities is also being encouraged to\ndeliver a cleaner recycled product to the processors.\nRecycled materials are produced from mixed colour PVC pipes, resulting in a brownish colour.\nPVC pipes are colour-coded for particular applications: water pipes are blue, electrical conduits\nare orange and stormwater pipes are white. The brownish colour of recycled material makes\nit most appropriate for multi-layer pipes, where the inside and outside are made from a virgin\nmaterial and the middle layer is made from recycled material. Multi-layer pipes are more rigid\nand are used for non-pressure applications, such as electrical conduit pipe.\nOpportunities for other projects\nIncreasing the recycling rates of PVC pipe will increase the life cycle of PVC, reduce the\namount of PVC going to landfill, and therefore reduce the health risks of landfill fires.\nPVC can be recycled six to seven times. With a product life of 100 years, this means that PVC\nmaterial could potentially have a lifespan of 600 years. All recycled PVC can be utilised in multi-\nlayer non-pressure pipe.\nThere is an opportunity to raise awareness of the market for waste PVC pipe—PVC pipe can\nbe extracted from the waste stream and have an extended useful life.\nLeft: Centralised post consumer pipe waiting for processing into new material.\nRight: PVC multi layered pipe showing recycled material at the core.\n29", "text_len": 2417, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This case\nstudy outlines the initiatives that James Hardie has been taking to reduce waste across their\nmanufacturing process to produce products and materials with a smaller environmental\nfootprint.\nThe market for fibre cement building products is growing. It is being used increasingly in\nthe exterior and interior of buildings, for example, exterior cladding, internal lining, facades\nand flooring. James Hardie continues to research and develop products that help to achieve\nsustainable construction. James Hardie strives to manufacture products that are low in\nembodied energy (compared to functional alternatives), low maintenance, durable, require\nlighter frames and construction techniques, do not emit volatile organic compounds, can be put\nup quickly with few trades and can be used to create energy-efficient buildings in all climates.\nA primary focus is to reduce waste. This is achieved by increased plant efficiencies which\nreduce environmental impact by optimising the conversion of valuable resources and energy\ninto high-value building products.\nYield improvements are achieved by reusing manufacturing by-products in the manufacturing\nprocess as raw materials and recycling by-products as resource inputs into other processes.\nThe composition of fibre cement by-products is primarily sand, cement and cellulose. These\nvaluable resource inputs are used in other building materials, enabling recycling and by-product\nsubstitutions with other building product manufacturers.\nUse of recycled and re-used material\nJames Hardie reuses several process by-products internally and externally. These include:\n• recycling a proportion of by-product into the manufacture of pallets. This by-product, which\nmay otherwise go to landfill, replaces timber components on some pallets and helps to\nreduce demand for timber\n• partnering with a major cement manufacturer where the by-product is reintroduced into\nthe cement manufacturing process. This helps to reduce the demand for natural quarry\nmaterials used for cement manufacture\n• partnering of the Rosehill plant with a major producer of road base materials where by-\nproduct fines are reducing the demand for crushed materials. The result of these efforts is\nthat the James Hardie Rosehill plant has reduced its landfill footprint by over 80 per cent,\neliminating 16 000 tonnes of waste to landfill per year.\n30 | Construction and demolition waste guide", "text_len": 2647, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The majority of power poles are made from\nAustralian hardwood timbers such as Spotted Gum, Ironbark, Blackbutt, Grey Box, Tallow\nWood and Blood Wood. These timbers are increasingly hard to find in length and quantity,\nand redundant power poles offer a valuable resource for a market where there is an\nincreasing demand for recycled timbers.\nAn important stakeholder in Kennedy’s quest has been Energex, a Queensland energy\ncompany. Energex, the owners of the poles, cooperated with Kennedy’s Timber to reclaim\nthe timber. On 1 April 2011 Kennedy’s Timber was awarded the 2010 Energex Innovation\nin Sustainability Award. This award is made to the Energex supplier that achieves the most\nexcellent sustainability initiative. It was awarded to Kennedy’s for perseverance, commitment to\nenvironmental practices and the development of innovative solutions in helping Energex reduce\ncarbon dioxide emissions. The awards presented at the ceremony were even crafted from a\nre-used Energex power pole.\nUse of recycled and re-used material\nKennedy’s Timber recycles old Energex power poles and cross arms to sell as recycled timber,\na process that has now been extended to shorter length poles. The correct protocols for\nhandling the contaminated timber off-cuts and residual product are important to ensure strong\nenvironmental compliance. After sawing, drying, docking and dressing, an average of 40 per\ncent of the wood fibre volume is directed to timber re-use products and beneficial re-use away\nfrom landfill. Kennedy’s Timber currently processes approximately 6000 m³ of poles and cross\narms per year. Further innovations in processing technology will result in enhanced timber\nrecoveries and a wider range of finished timber products being produced.\nDrivers for re-use\nTimber power poles have historically been treated with copper chromium and arsenic, boron\nor creosote to make them more durable to the elements. Treated timber is sent to landfill\nfor disposal, however power poles contain valuable and useful timber that is not affected by\ntreatment. Recovering the value of the untreated components of power pole timber has been\none driver for the project.\nRedundant power poles also represented a carbon cost to Energex in terms of their Scope 3\nemissions as defined by the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme. By working\nwith Kennedy’s Timber to recycle the redundant power poles, Energex have eliminated this\nwaste from their carbon emissions profile and turned a liability into an asset on their financial\nbottom line.\n34 | Construction and demolition waste guide", "text_len": 2881, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The completed project is a showcase for the company’s capabilities in design\nand construction management and has been completed to a high level of detail.\nUse of recycled and re-used material\nThe project re-used 95.1 per cent by weight of all construction waste. This included:\n• black caesar stone removed from a prominent South Australian public building as part of a\nprevious refurbishment project\n• recycled mechanical spiral ductwork re-used for 295 pot plant sleeves\n• recycled timber used for all wall noggins for partition walls\n• recycled fire sprinkler pipework used for the PPE display\n• timber palettes used to deliver and store mechanical ductwork to create partitioning in the\n‘palette room’\n• surplus concrete reinforcing mesh which was powder coated and installed as part of the\nreception area\n• re-used 40-gallon steel drums salvaged from Built Environs’ plant yard used for seating in\nthe break-out area\n• re-used wire mesh from surplus stock on previous projects used in the stair balustrade\ndesign.\nDrivers for recycling and re-use\nA flagship project—a key driver for the construction and demolition waste recycling and re-\nuse was for Built Environs to demonstrate what their company could do. Lessons learned and\nexperiences gained are being applied across their projects for clients.\nPursuing a philosophy—the 100 Hutt Street project was founded on environmental design\nsolutions and sustainable methodologies. The team ensured readily accessible waste materials\nwould be re-used within the fit-out as an alternative to conventional materials. This commitment\nwas taken as a corporate social responsibility and to increase knowledge among their\n43", "text_len": 2543, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The project has instilled an ethic\nwithin the company of waste minimisation which has become a core part of the culture.\nProblems, challenges and solutions\nDuring the project Built Environs engaged staff by holding information sessions and stakeholder\nengagement workshops. This enabled them to anticipate and address challenges as, or even\nbefore, they occurred.\nThe design team worked with the construction team to optimise opportunities for recycling and\nre-use.\nSpecifications and opportunities for other projects\n• Implement a waste management plan for all construction works, no matter how minor\n• When specifying products within a new build or refurbishment, the designer has the\nopportunity to nominate cladding and materials to be obtained from a reclaimed source\nwithin finishes schedule and specification requirements. The head contractor then can\npresent opportunities to the designer and client that may enable materials and products\nto be re-used and diverted from landfill or elimination of use of virgin materials\n• All offices should develop a recycling and waste management plan to encourage\nimprovements and waste minimisation\n44 | Construction and demolition waste guide", "text_len": 2239, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The\nhall and small seed shed containing an Indigenous plant nursery were constructed bale-by-bale\nby local residents and other volunteers from Sydney. The main body of the hall was built from\nstraw bales and rendered with mud. The building uses recycled materials for doors, frames and\nfittings. Paints and finishes are also environmentally friendly. Nalawala Hall incorporates the\nworld’s first concrete load-bearing foundation slab which is 95 per cent recycled. The recycled\nconcrete used for the Nalawala Hall and seed shed has been produced by the council’s own\nin-house construction material recycling operation in partnership with local concrete supply\ncompany Metromix. The hall has been in use since 2008 and the concrete slab is performing\nwell.\nUse of recycled and re-used material\nThe Nalawala Hall (‘nalawala’ is an Indigenous word for ‘sit down’) exemplifies the re-use of\nrecycled concrete among other construction and demolition waste re-use. Recycled materials\nused in the project include:\n• a 95 per cent recycled concrete load-bearing foundation slab, never before implemented\nanywhere in the world\n• recycled window frames and doors\n• Five tonnes of waste straw for the straw bale construction\n• 800 milk bottles of plastic waste re-used as toilet partitions.\nDrivers for re-use\nThe main driver for re-use was for Fairfield City Council to deliver on its commitment to\nsustainability and its work on Local Agenda 21 and Cities for Climate Protection. Fairfield City\nCouncil aimed to deliver a community building that would inspire the community to make more\nenvironmentally sustainable choices in their day-to-day routines.\nPotential benefits\nThe environmental benefits of the Nalawala Hall straw bale construction include:\n• converting waste straw into a valuable building resource\n• avoiding greenhouse gas generation, as straw is often burned\n• 10 times the insulation factor of double-brick cavity wall\n• an increase in the efficiency of solar-passive design\n• walls that are estimated to be 30 times less energy intensive than wood frame walls.\n45", "text_len": 2339, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Since the mid-1990s the\nconstruction industry was aware that concrete foundation slabs may provide the widest and\nmost economical field of application for recycled concrete. In a 1999 CSIRO report for the\nbuilding industry, a recommendation noted that a 30 per cent recycled concrete replacement of\nvirgin aggregates might be trialled for domestic slab construction. Fairfield City Council reported\nthat ‘the psychological barrier of ‘who’s first’ presented a challenge for greater recycled concrete\nmixes being used in slab construction. However in the Nalawala project an environmental\ndecision was made to specify a 95 per cent recycled concrete content in the foundation slab,\nand a calculated level of risk accepted.’\nThe use of recycled concrete at such a high level has the capacity to give architects, builders,\nbuilding inspectors and various stakeholders within the construction industry the confidence to\nmove ahead with high recycled concrete content for foundation slab specification, knowing that\nbenefits have been proven.\n46 | Construction and demolition waste guide", "text_len": 1467, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "29.Construction and Demolition Waste Guide Recycling and Re-use Across the Supply Chain.pdf", "page_num": 47, "text": "Recycling waffle pod waste\nDescription of project\nThis project demonstrates industry best practice in the development and delivery of a product\nstewardship scheme targeting the reduction of expanded polystyrene (EPS) litter from waffle\npod offcuts on building sites and the diversion of this material from landfill. The introduction of\nthe Pod Scrap Bag Program has been an industry initiative of Expanded Polystyrene Australia\n(EPSA) and its Pod Group members. Scrap bags are supplied with all pod deliveries to building\nsites to assist with the separation of EPS offcuts from the general waste stream. The filled scrap\nbags are then collected and taken back to the EPS manufacturer where it can be granulated\nand recycled in new waffle pods and other building and construction products.\nUse of recycled and re-used material\nEPS pods have become an important part of building concrete slabs, particularly for domestic\ndwellings. The lightweight and superior compressive strength of EPS pods deliver formwork for\nslabs that is uniform and consistent with ease, thereby reducing construction time and costs.\nIn addition, the thermal properties of EPS provide significant insulation benefits, making waffle\npods popular in new-home construction where concrete slabs are used.\nThe size of the waffle pod market in Australia is around 7000 tonnes per year. From this,\naround 600 tonnes of EPS pod offcuts are generated on building sites. It is estimated that\nwhere the Pod Scrap Bag Program has been implemented, the collection and recycling rate\nof EPS pod offcuts is extremely effective—around 90 per cent.\nDrivers for re-use\nAs a result of the persistent waste on and around building sites from the use of waffle pods,\nthere has been a threat to regulate against their use. The industry responded with the\nintroduction of the Pod Scrap Bag Program.\nPotential benefits\nEPS pod manufacturers can incorporate up to 40 per cent recycled materials in the production\nof waffle pods—this offers significant economic benefits through the reduction of virgin material\nrequired to manufacture the pods and environmental benefits, with all scrap and offcuts able to\nbe recycled and re-used in new pods rather than going to landfill.\nProblems and challenges\nOne challenge is to educate end users of waffle pods, such as builders and concreters, on\nthe correct use of the pod scrap bags to ensure the EPS offcuts are segregated without\ncontamination from other building site waste.\n47", "text_len": 2470, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

{"source_file": "29.Construction and Demolition Waste Guide Recycling and Re-use Across the Supply Chain.pdf", "page_num": 49, "text": "CHALLENGES\nDuring research for this guide many stakeholders involved in projects related to re-use and\nrecycling of construction and demolition waste were interviewed and asked about their views\non the key challenges and barriers to markets. Four main challenges were ubiquitous. They are\ndetailed below to highlight the need for time and resources to address these challenges.\nKnowledge across industry and requirement for training\nThe Institute of Public Works Engineering Australia Limited have been developing a\nspecifications course designed to help project managers and engineers responsible for\npublic works understand the specifications of new materials such as recycled aggregates\nand substitute materials, and to learn how to incorporate them into projects. As the range of\nproducts and materials increases there will be a greater need for such courses to provide\nawareness of materials and, more importantly, knowledge of how to use them successfully in\nprojects.\nCross-contamination of wastes\nThe recovery rate of useful material is hampered by cross-contamination with other materials,\nparticularly in the mixed construction and demolition waste stream. Asbestos contamination is a\nwell-documented problem and still presents a significant issue in waste derived from demolition\nand renovation works, not new construction. High recovery rates for materials are achieved\nwhen materials are captured closer to the source, before there is opportunity for mixing with\nother wastes. This is clearly demonstrated in the case studies, where greatest recycling rates\nare achieved when the waste materials are captured early and segregated.\nTechnological barriers\nThere remain opportunities to recycle and re-use significant volumes of materials that are still\nbeing sent to landfill due to the inability to identify markets for the material as it is presented,\nor due to the lack of technology and/or equipment to sufficiently clean or segregate materials.\nThis is particularly the case with the timber waste stream where there is contamination from\ntreated timber products. There is a clear need for investment in research and development to\novercome technological barriers.\nDesign for deconstruction\nDesigning for deconstruction, a practice that is gaining prominence, offers an opportunity for\ngreater resource recovery at the end of a building’s life. A building that is designed to be taken\napart at the end of its life offers greater opportunities for resource recovery and, with time,\ndesign for deconstruction principles may be applied further up the supply chain to materials and\nbuilding components. A link to resources on design for deconstruction is given in the resources\nsection of this guide.\n49", "text_len": 2714, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
