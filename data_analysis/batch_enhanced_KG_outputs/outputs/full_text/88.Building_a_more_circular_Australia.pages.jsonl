Recycling Recycle discarded materials after demolition/\nfrom deconstruction\nconsumption\nThe anticipated pipeline of infrastructure in Australia expected to be deliver over the next decade presents a\nsignificant opportunity for government and industry to rapidly implement circular economic principles and\nstrategies into the built environment. This is crucial as the construction and demolition sector in Australia\ncurrently accounts for 31% (23 metric tonnes) of the waste in Australia.13 This is partly due to the nature of\nsector, but also because of the conventional design and construction methods currently adopted leading to\nsignificant waste.\nAs illustrated in this report, there are significant benefits generated by government and industry transitioning\ntoward a circular economy. The framework above presents a pathway to a more circular infrastructure and\nbuilt environment in Australia.\nIncorporating circular opportunities throughout the asset life of infrastructure and the built environment creates\nvalue for the economy, provides opportunities for industry to create new revenue streams, products and\nservices, and better outcomes for our environment.\n13.
