Passionate about reducing waste in the built environment, WSP Australia’s Future\nReady Circular Economy Lead highlights the benefits of implementing circular economy principles in minimising the\nenvironmental footprint of the construction industry.\n\nMarch 31, 2021\nReading time : 7 minutes\n\nBuildings Roundup (BR): For starters, what is the circular\neconomy?\n\nValentina Petrone (VP): The circular economy is all about designing out waste — how we manage resources, how we make and use\nproducts, and what we do with the materials afterwards. A circular economy approach means shifting away from the linear, ‘take,\nmake, use and dispose’, route towards a circular approach where we maintain the value of waste resources for as long as possible.\n\nIn the context of the built environment (/en-ca/sectors/environment) it means changing the way we design, operate and dismantle\nbuildings, considering the whole building lifecycle.\n\n \n\nLinear Approach Circular Approach\n\ndispose\n\n \n\nIf we were to design and operate a building according to circular economy principles, we would start by considering what materials\nwe would use. Can we increase the percentage of recycled content to reduce the amount of virgin materials used? How do we\noptimise flexibility and quality of design to realise changes of use that might take place over, say, a 50-year timespan? Can we look\nat new types of structures (/en-ca/services/structural-engineering) that can be disassembled easily for use in other buildings at the\nend of the building's life, for example by incorporating bolted connection systems?\n\n \n\nThen we would consider the interior fitout. Rather than a company coming into a building and starting from scratch with new\nfurniture and equipment that gets thrown out when it breaks or at the end of the tenancy agreement, everything is rented — similar to\nUber, where we use the service rather than owning a car. So instead of buying furniture, lighting systems, even lifts, the building\nowner can rent them, shifting the onus for quality, maintenance and repair onto the providers. Rather than throwing away a chair\nbecause it’s cheaper to replace than fix, you send it back for mending — creating jobs for people who know how to repair stuff.\nEventually the circular economy will be the catalyst for a big economic shift.\n\f", "text_len": 2383, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Will it add to\nthe cost of construction?\n\n \n\n \n\nVP: International recognition of the growing threat of waste to the environment (/en-ca/sectors/environment) and the limitations of a\nlinear consumption model have led to significant economies like China, the European Union and the UK taking a leading role in\nintroducing circular economy principles to their policies. Here in Australia, our government has been motivated by China’s waste\nimport policy (known as China’s Sword) that imposed restrictions to the import of multiple Australian recyclables materials in 2018\ncombined with the increasing cost of waste to landfill to go beyond recycling through the implementation of circular economy\ninitiatives. Given the environmental impact of construction on the built environment (/en-ca/sectors/environment), there are big\ngovernment pushes to implement these principles. And | do feel that the construction industry in Australia is ready to listen. As a\nvolunteer member of the Urban Land Institute's Sydney Committee, | recently spoke at an event about the circular economy specific\nto the built environment (/en-ca/sectors/environment)in Australia, which was very well received.\n\n \n\n \n\nFor sure there are challenges. For example, in construction the building code will need to be updated to allow the use of\nremanufactured elements and greater quantities of recycled content in building materials in a safe way. But | feel things are moving.\nFor example, the New South Wales State Government has a draft policy to guide decision making towards a circular economy to\ndeliver positive economic, social and environmental outcomes and to embed circular economy principles in Government policies,\nstrategies and programs. An important next step would be to mandate procurement of higher quality materials that last, and for\nmaterials to include a certain percentage of recycled content.\n\nIn terms of costs, there is still some resistance, being a new concept. However, from the studies I’ve researched, when you consider\nthe whole lifecycle of the building there are key financial benefits including higher value for future assets, capture residual value of\nconstruction materials and higher leasability.\n\f", "text_len": 2377, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Next step would be to baseline an organisation or project’s position and work together to define achievable\ngoals in line with circular economy principles and where the costs and savings could come. It’s about totally changing the mindset\nand clients | speak to are becoming excited about the concept.\n\nBR: Have you seen examples of projects built according to\ncircular economy principles?\n\nVP: Hans Hammink of Architekten Cie in The Netherlands was one of my co-presenters at the ULI event. He showed us a recent\nexample of his work, the Circl project in Amsterdam, the first constructed example of circular design. It’s a very attractive, practical\nbuilding, even though there were challenges, such as finding enough recycled timber for the floors, but it demonstrates the benefits\nand the possibilities of the approach. He is also one of the creators of the Building Passport, which | find extremely interesting.\nWorking with BIM (/en-ca/services/building-information-modelling-bim), you can create a model linked to circular data that\ndescribes the quantity and type of material of each component of the building, from the structural (/en-ca/services/structural-\nengineering) elements right down to the screws.\n\nBR: Finally, Valentina, where did your passion for waste\navoidance begin?\n\nVP: I'm an architect by background and for the first 10 years of my career in Europe I’ve been focused on implementing solar passive\ndesign strategies and energy-saving solutions to my projects, aiming to minimise the environmental footprint. Waste avoidance and\nwater minimisation has always played a key role in the overall picture.\n\nSix years ago, | moved with my family from Italy to Australia and we landed in Perth. While working there as an architect, | joined a\nlocal environmental group to get to know the new country and engage with the community where we were living. There | realised\nthat waste is a very good starting point for people who aren't familiar with sustainability and related topics, because garbage is\nvisible and with a minimal money investment, like buying a reusable coffee cup or shopping bags, we can see the benefits of our\nactions.\n\n| became really interested in community behavioural change, starting the conversation with waste as the entry point, then going to\nmore complicated topics such as energy-saving design for homes, renewables, and so on. | was also very struck by the\nwastefulness | was seeing in the local construction industry. | was shocked to see a tall, 15-storey building knocked down in a day —\nso different from in Italy where we have a strong tradition of building conservation and restoration.\n\nEventually, | was able to combine my architectural background with my passion for eliminating waste and promoting best\nenvironmental practises in the property industry working as Senior Environmental Consultant for a boutique consultancy firm first\nand then joining WSP early last year, where I’m really excited to continue my journey to promote the circular economy in the built\nenvironment (/en-ca/sectors/environment).\n\f", "text_len": 3251, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
