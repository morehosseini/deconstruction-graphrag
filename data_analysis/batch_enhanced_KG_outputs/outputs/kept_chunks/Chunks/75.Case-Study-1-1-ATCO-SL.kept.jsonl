This is because some PwRC\nare invariably wasted or contaminated in the process, and the recycling process requires energy\nconsumption. In some cases, construction and demolition waste from a site can be reused in the new\nconstruction, reducing the necessity to transport these materials to and from recycling facilities. A\nstudy conducted in Australia15 indicated that reusing demolition waste in the new construction on the\nsame site has resulted in 1,000 fewer truck movements, 9,000 L of diesel saved, and therefore, 663 t\nof CO were avoided. The study found that the carbon emission reductions were achieved in three key\n2\nareas: onsite, through the replacement of raw materials with recovered demolition products; offsite,\nthrough recycling; and during transport, through reduced truck movements.\nThe second benefit is related to reduced waste disposal from demolition activities.

This way they can influence their internal stakeholders to advance the circularity of their\nproducts. Almost all participants in this study emphasised the importance of exploring opportunities\nto capture the value of waste resources and enhance the utilisation of PwRC in modular construction.\nFor example, C P and C P stressed the need to revisit their production line to evaluate opportunities\n1 1 1 4\nfor material recyclability and reuse.
