Waste recycling/reprocessing\nRecycling of waste at the recycling facility involves several processes such as collection, further sorting,\nstockpiling of unprocessed waste, recycling and conversion of waste materials into raw materials that\ncan be used in the manufacturing of new products [1]. Recycling also involves the reprocessing of a\nproduct into new materials.

Rethinking and revising the relationship between resources and the\neconomy and setting targets to achieve waste reduction and a high level of resource recovery becomes\nessential to thrive the industry to move towards the circular economy. According to Esmaeilian et al.\n[5], efforts from traditional waste management practices have failed to consider the complete material\nlifecycle, i.e. cradle-to-grave pattern of material usage. Yet, circular economy opportunities are\nemerging to create a waste value chain from the entire product lifecycle.
