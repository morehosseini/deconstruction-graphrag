However, these decisions are made taking into consideration mainly\nthe financial viability and feasibility of the practices, putting the consultants in a position\nwhere they are the ones that need to propose an argument that the circular economy\npractices are the best option and will provide the best outcomes for the project.\nThe construction industry already incorporates certain waste management practices for\nspecific materials, such as bricks and timber, that reflect circular economy principles to\nsome extent. However, participants discuss such practices and understand such\npractices as sustainable practices rather than as part of a circular economy approach.\n53"}

Even\nthough they all showed interest in implementing circular economy practices, the\ncomplexity of the construction environment on-site creates a challenge that still requires\nfurther research. For example, SH noted “the potential to sort out materials during\nconstruction ... on-site from the start …, but in most cases, that never happens, so things\njust get disposed of wherever” (SH, 2022). ND had a similar experience on-site, where\nsite staff disposed of waste “on the closet bin” (ND, 2022), disregarding protocols and\nprocedures. At the same time, ND, SH, and MI identified in their experience the lack of\nmonitoring structures where waste is accounted for and classified according to the way it\ngot sorted."}
