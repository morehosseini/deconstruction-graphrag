The credit requires the use of waste contractors and waste processing facilities that have been independently\nverified for compliance with minimum standards of reporting. The introduction of such compliance standards and checks aims to\nensure contractors and facilities are operating with environmentally responsible due diligence on behalf of Green Star projects.\nVerification of compliance with these reporting criteria would be carried out by ‘Suitably Qualified Auditors’ who are engaged directly\nby a Green Star project applicant’s waste contractor/s and waste processing facilities.\nAn auditor’s report is to be provided to Green Star projects by the waste contractor as supporting evidence to demonstrate\ncompliance with the relevant credit and rating tool.\nOnly waste reports that have been generated by waste contractors whose compliance has been verified will be accepted.\n07 September 2021 Page 4", "text_len": 1871, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

A Compliance Verification Summary is valid for 12\nmonths from the date of issue and must be current for the duration of the time that an auditee provides waste services and waste\nreports to a Green Star project.\nEnvironmental Management Systems (EMS) Auditor\nThe Environmental Management System (EMS) auditor certification program has been developed by Exemplar Global to provide\ninternational recognition for auditors who conduct environmental management system audits based on the ISO 14001:2015\nenvironmental management system standard.\nFurther information regarding the Environmental management Systems Auditor certification provided by Exemplar Global can be\nfound here: https://exemplarglobal.org/certification/environmental-systems/environmental-management-system-ems-auditor/\nGreen Star Construction and Demolition (C&D) Waste Management Reporting Criteria\nAre criteria that establish the minimum acceptable standard of operations and reporting for waste contractors and waste processing\nfacilities that provide services and reports to Green Star projects. Waste contractors and waste processing facilities that provide waste\nmanagement and reporting services to Green Star projects must achieve independent verification of their compliance with the criteria.\nSuch verification of compliance is a prerequisite for the recognition and acceptance of the waste reports that are provided within\nGreen Star ‘Construction and Demolition Waste’ credit submissions. The Reporting criteria are detailed in sections three, four and five\nof this document.\nLandfill\nRefers to a site where waste materials are disposed of by way of burial between layers of soil.\nResidual Waste\nRefers to the material remaining after the resource recovery process has taken place. In accordance with waste hierarchy principles,\nthis remaining material has no other viable fate than to be used as fuel for energy recovery or committed to landfill.\nSuitably Qualified Auditor\nRefers to an auditor who has the relevant knowledge, skills and experience necessary to provide advice to applicants on the issues\naddressed in the Reporting Criteria. It does not refer to ‘Appointed Auditors’ as defined under various State Environment Protection\nActs. Auditors must be independent with a particular focus on how they manage conflicts of interest with applicants (i.e. they must be\nan external, independent, third-party auditor). They must also provide evidence of their qualifications as defined in this document. See\nsection seven of this document for further information.\nWaste Contractor\nRefers to the company or person(s) engaged by a builder, developer or owner of a structure to manage the containerisation,\ncollection and transportation of construction and demolition waste from a construction site to recyclers or waste processing facilities.\nWaste contractors must provide their customers with reports on the contents, dates, volumes or weights of construction and\ndemolition waste, as well as the waste processing facility destinations and registration numbers of the vehicles transporting waste\nfrom the site to processing facilities.\nWaste Processing Facility\nIs a lawfully operating facility that receives construction and demolition waste for processing. The facility recovers recyclable materials\nfrom the waste stream, including for energy, thereby minimising the amount of residual waste committed to landfill.

Reporting accuracy\nmust be within an average five per cent margin of error.\nInterim measure\nThere are no interim measures available for this criterion.\nAuditor verification guidance\nAuditors should verify compliance by sampling customer records for at least three medium to large size job sites (select Green Star\nprojects if available). The two-part methodology set out below should be used to determine the accuracy of a waste contractor’s\nreporting practices. Worked examples of the calculation methodology to determine reporting accuracy are provided for parts I and II. It\nis the Waste Contractor’s responsibility to collate and present all inbound waste dockets forwarded by waste processing facilities.\nIn order to award compliance with the criterion, the average percentage variation findings for both Part I and Part II must be within a\nfive per cent margin of error.\nCollecting audit documentation:\n• Choose a three month sample operating period or 50 records covering a continuous period where less than 50 records have\nbeen generated in any continuous three months period, for each job site;\n• Obtain copies of waste contractor’s waste reports to customer for sample periods;\n• Obtain waste contractor’s disposal docket records for sample jobs over sample periods;\n• Obtain copies of the corresponding inbound waste dockets from the waste processing facilities for sample jobs over sample\nperiods; and\n• Where the contractor waste report provides waste disposal figures in volume, but disposal dockets are reported in weight, the\nauditor must convert results to mass using the same volume-to-mass conversion factors applied by the contractor or receiving\nfacility.\n07 September 2021 Page 10", "text_len": 2650, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Where the waste processing facility is located on the same\nsite as a landfill then access between the waste processing facility and landfill must be clearly separated (for example by controlled\nroad access, fences or weighbridges). This separation ensures all waste input, as well as recyclables and residual waste outputs, are\nclearly traceable to and from the waste processing facility and reported separately from general solid waste landfill inputs not passing\nthrough the waste processing facility’s resource recovery process.\nRequirement 2 - Clear tracking system to separate residual waste from recyclables (weighbridge):\nThe waste processing facility must have at least one weighbridge to quantify and provide an auditable trail for weights of inbound\nwaste as well as weights of outbound recyclables and residuals. If the waste processing facility is located on the same site as a\nlandfill then it must have separate weighbridge receipts. If the auditor cannot verify to their satisfaction that there is clear separation of\nrecycling from residual, compliance with this criterion cannot be awarded.\nRequirement 3 - Certified weighbridge and operational procedures:\nThe waste processing facility must hold a current weighbridge maintenance certificate (certified annually) for the use of an appropriate\nweighbridge ensuring the weighbridge is fit for purpose and regularly maintained. The facility must also have weighbridge operational\nprocedures in place to create and maintain weighbridge records on the following information for waste materials received, outgoing\nrecyclables and residual waste:\n• vehicle registration and date and time received;\n• weight of vehicle and material incoming;\n• source of material incoming (for example customer numbers);\n• weight of vehicle and material outgoing;\n• fate of material outgoing (by product type, including residual waste to energy recovery or landfill and the entity/customer\nremoving it); and\n• any rejected loads.\nRequirement 4 -Source and fate of inbound and outbound waste:\nThe waste processing facilities must be able to account for the source of all inbound waste and fate of all outbound recyclables and\nresidual waste.\n07 September 2021 Page 18", "text_len": 3121, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Paramount to this outcome is clear separation and accountability for the weights of outbound\nrecyclables and residuals. The transparency of reports generated by a single weighbridge that is shared between a waste processing\nfacility and landfill operation is questionable and difficult to audit thereby potentially compromising the accuracy of a waste processing\nfacility’s waste diversion rate claims.\nWhere a waste processing facility is located on a landfill site, best practice operation includes the separation of weighbridges and\naccess points for the respective landfill and recycling facilities.

This interim measure is provided on the basis that some of these operators\nmay not have sufficient systems in place to produce reliable waste balance reports because they have never before been required to\ngenerate such reports on a regular basis.\nWhere data or reporting procedures are insufficient to determine a reprocessing facility’s annual percentage of residual waste output\ncommitted to landfill, then a default value of 50 per cent waste diversion to landfill may be awarded until the end of the interim period,\nor until the applicant can provide at least six months of operational waste balance data to the auditor for a re-audit of the criterion.\nPlease refer to the ‘Interim Measures’ section for full details of what is required of the applicant and auditor to claim this interim\nmeasure allowance.\nGuidance\nGeneral note\nThis criterion directly supports Green Star ‘Construction and Demolition Waste’ credit submission claims by providing builders, head\ncontractors and Green Star Accredited Professionals (GSAPs) with publicly available and independently verified data regarding the\ndiversion rates and residual waste contributions to landfill from specific waste processing facilities.\nWaste-to-Energy\nResidual waste diverted from landfill for the purposes of energy recovery is a valid recycling pathway. However, for the purposes of\nthese Reporting Criteria, a waste processing facility’s diversion of waste for energy recovery is limited to 50 percent of the facility’s\ntotal input.\nThis 50 percent cap is based on the GBCA’s position that energy recovery from construction and demolition waste streams is not an\nacceptable substitution for recycling in its own right, but rather a complementary management solution for wastes that would\n07 September 2021 Page 21", "text_len": 3137, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Such\nreviews typically take into consideration the uptake of the initiatives by the affected industries and seek to measure the benefits and\ncosts to participating industries, GBCA members and Green Star users. These reviews aim to update criteria to improve their\napplicability towards best practice and usually involve the adjustment of criteria benchmarks.\nNotice of Intent to Introduce ISO 14001 Certified Environmental Management Systems in Future Revision:\nFuture versions of these reporting criteria may include an additional requirement for waste processing facilities to hold current ISO\n14001 certification for their environmental management system (EMS).\nIn the initial development of the reporting criteria the GBCA agreed to postpone the introduction of this criterion based on feedback\nfrom industry stakeholders asserting that this measure would prove too restrictive in the short term.\nIt is the intent of the GBCA to introduce ISO 14001 certification as a criterion in the reporting criteria when the criteria are next\nreviewed and updated.
