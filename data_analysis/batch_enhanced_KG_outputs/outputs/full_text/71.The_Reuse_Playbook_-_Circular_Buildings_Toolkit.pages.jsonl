While crucial, these solutions need to be complemented by a\nrevision of how we design, make, and use products and materials.\nThere are many ways to incorporate circular strategies into your project and a great place to start is with the Circular\nBuildings Toolkit. The Toolkit outlines four main circular economy strategies that directly address emissions from\nthe built environment:\n1. Build nothing - make better use of existing buildings through sharing, flexibility and refurbishment so fewer new\nbuildings need to be erected.\n2. Build for long term value – increase building utilisation and design for durability, adaptability and\ndeconstructability\n3. Build efficiently – Use fewer new materials through lean design, reducing waste and recycling and reusing\nexisting materials and components.\n4. Build with the right resources – select materials which are renewable, recyclable, non-hazardous and promote\nbiodiversity.\nFigure 1: Extract from 'From Principles to Practices: First Steps towards a Circular Built Environment' (Ellen MacArthur\nThe framework sets out metrics and actions for each strategy, each of which can have a huge impact on our built Foundation, 2022)\nenvironment designs.

A broad sequence of when we expect each topic to be approached in the process is shown in Figure 2.\nIn reality, the reuse process may involve jumping from one to another, and iterative circles between different stages. A key assumption we have made when writing this chapter is that the readers are operating in a context where\nThe chapters are written so that readers can start at any point in the cycle, with links between chapters added where circularity in construction is yet to be realised, and as such we address the challenges associated with working with\ntopics are relevant to more than one chapter. assets that have not been designed with future uses in mind.\n1.7 When to reuse?\nThis playbook is applicable from the point of where complete in-situ reuse or refurbishment has been thoroughly\nexplored and deemed not to be feasible. This may be because the existing asset is not suited to the proposed use due\nto spatial shortcomings or degradation and the level of intervention required is costly and carbon intensive.\nPrior to this point, it is important to complete not only a desk study but also on the ground research to understand the\nassets full context. This includes its context within the existing and proposed local area, the local community, how\nthey currently engage with it, what would benefit them moving forwards and any cultural impacts of a change,\nexisting heritage of the building itself and of the area it’s in.

However, using the PROGRESS calculation method for accounting for the potential benefit of reuse12,\nwhich assigns the potential benefits of steel reuse to Module D, the DfD alternative provides a net reduction in\nembodied carbon (Figure 4).

It is a reinforced concrete frame of 32\nfloors and stands at 125m tall. Extensive feasibility studies have demonstrated that the tight floor-to-ceiling\nheights and floorplate designed for cellular offices could not reasonably provide modern spec office space, and\nindeed the existing building has not been fully occupied in more than 30 years. However, the concrete is in\nexcellent condition and still has significant value as primary structure.\nThe concept for material reuse at Euston Tower is to ‘harvest’ panels of existing reinforced concrete which can\nserve as new ‘precast’ panels in the new building. This has arisen out of a desire from the client and design team\nto make best use of the existing tower while providing a best-in-class commercial offering. The existing\nfoundations and central stability core are to be retained in-situ.\nWhile reuse of steel is beginning to gain mainstream traction, reuse of cast in situ reinforced concrete is still in its\ninfancy.\nOur structural typology is ribbed slab (see Figure 5), which is an advantageous form of construction for reuse\nbecause the arrangement of reinforcing bars in the slab is clear by inspection. This might not be the case in flat\nslab construction where bars may be designed for a specific task and their location not immediately evident when\nviewed externally. Original reinforcement drawings at Euston Tower have been lost, so reuse is limited to simple\ncomponents of the structure .\nCutting the panel such that the plank would span a shorter distance than the current condition was felt to be not\nFigure 17: Comparison of the case study floorplate to an alternative designed for deconstruction against key such a great leap into the unknown, provided sufficient anchorage for bars could be redeveloped through the\nparameters connection detailing.

The project focused on reusing and refurbishing\nexisting mechanical, electrical, and public health systems to minimise waste and embodied energy. This\ninnovative approach preserved the building's iconic features while adapting it to meet contemporary needs.The\nprocess of ‘test, appraise, use or abandon’ was applied rigorously to all existing plant, to ensure it was capable of\nfunctioning for the 15-year tenant lease period to meet the team’s ambition for reuse. This included getting the\noriginal equipment manufacturers on site to survey the plant and provide a report and recommendations on the\nwork needed to extend its life.\n90% of the mechanical central plant was reused, including AHUs, cooling towers, and chillers. The cooling towers\nwere refurbished, while the chillers were capacity tested and found to be in good condition. The building's\ndistinctive heated façade system was retained.\nThe existing public health water systems, including chilled water and hot water systems, were reused. New\ncalorifiers had to be installed but the load profile was optimised to accommodate the mixed-use nature of the\nFigure 19: Extraction of in-situ slab at Euston Tower building.\nhttps://www.cibsejournal.com/case-studies/case-study-the-challenge-of-reusing-central-plant-at-the-60m-retrofit-\nof-1-finsbury-avenue/\n9.12.3 Case Study 6: Lighting refurbishment Manchester Town Hall (Manchester, UK), Whitecroft Lighting\nManchester City Council has begun a six year programme of activity to decarbonise its estate of buildings, which\nincludes refurbishing the Town Hall.

This is leading some MP\nplatforms to seek alternative routes to close the material loop. Madaster, for example, is\nliaising with manufacturers to explore take-back schemes, where the passporting platform\nwould track and trace materal/product use and signal to manufacturers when these are ready\nto be fed back into their system for reconditioning.", "text_len": 7291, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
