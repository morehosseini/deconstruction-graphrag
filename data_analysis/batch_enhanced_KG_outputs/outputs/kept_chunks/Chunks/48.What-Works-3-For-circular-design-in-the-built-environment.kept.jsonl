It involves a design philosophy that allows for\nthe systematic dismantling of a product or structure at the end of its life, without compromising the integrity of\nits constituent materials or components. By doing so, it promotes effective value retention through the\npossibilities of reuse or recycling. Additionally, this strategy underscores the importance of selecting\nmaterials that are not only durable but also easily able to be recycled or repurposed ensuring that the\nmaterials themselves can continue to contribute to a circular economy even after the asset's initial lifecycle\nends.\nCircular Economy Principles: Design out waste and pollution & keep products and material in use at\nhighest value.\nDesign actions:\n• Work with the supply chain to incorporate ‘product as a service’ options where possible (for example\nplant and equipment).\n• Plan for end-of-life disassembly to maximise reuse and recycling from the outset.\n• Specify materials and products that are easy to disassemble e.g., modular.\n• Use connection systems and construction methods that enable disassembly."}
