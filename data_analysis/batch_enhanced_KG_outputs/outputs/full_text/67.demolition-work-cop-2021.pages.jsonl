In most cases, following an approved code of practice would achieve\ncompliance with the health and safety duties in the WHS Act, in relation to the subject matter\nof the code. Like regulations, codes of practice deal with particular issues and do not cover\nall hazards or risks which may arise. The health and safety duties require duty holders to\nconsider all risks associated with work, not only those for which regulations and codes of\npractice exist.\nCodes of practice are admissible in court proceedings under the WHS Act and WHS\nRegulation. Courts may regard a code of practice as evidence of what is known about a\nhazard, risk or control and may rely on the code in determining what is reasonably\npracticable in the circumstances to which the code relates.\nAn inspector may refer to an approved code of practice when issuing an improvement or\nprohibition notice. This may include issuing an improvement notice for failure to comply with\na code of practice where equivalent or higher standards of work health and safety have not\nbeen demonstrated.\nScope and application\nThis Code is intended to be read by a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU).\nIt provides practical guidance to PCBUs on how to manage health and safety risks\nassociated with demolition work.\nThe guidance in this Code is relevant to demolition contractors as well as PCBUs who have\nmanagement or control of workplaces where excavation work is carried out, for example\nprincipal contractors.\nThis Code may be a useful reference for other persons interested in the duties under the\nWHS Act and the WHS Regulation.\nThis Code applies to all workplaces covered by the WHS Act where demolition work is\ncarried out and where demolition work products and equipment are used and stored.\nHow to use this Code of Practice\nThis Code includes references to the legal requirements under the WHS Act and the\nWHS Regulation. These are included for convenience only and should not be relied on in\nplace of the full text of the WHS Act or WHS Regulation. The words ‘must’, ‘requires’ or\n‘mandatory’ indicate a legal requirement exists that must be complied with.\nThe word ‘should’ is used in this Code to indicate a recommended course of action, while\n‘may’ is used to indicate an optional course of action.\nDemolition work Code of Practice 2021 Page 4 of 53", "text_len": 3079, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Therefore, when carrying out demolition\nwork, the requirements relating to construction work must also be complied with.\nDemolition work is also ‘high risk construction work’ if it involves demolition of an element of\na structure that is load-bearing or otherwise related to the physical integrity of the structure.\nA Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) must be prepared before the high risk construction\nwork starts. Further guidance on SWMS is available in section 3.4 of this Code.\nOther key terms relating to demolition work are listed in Appendix A.\n1.2 Who has health and safety duties in relation to\ndemolition work?\nDuty holders who have a role in managing the risks of demolition work include:\n• persons conducting a business or undertaking (PCBUs)\n• designers, manufacturers, importers, suppliers and installers of plant, substances or\nstructures, and\n• officers.\nWorkers and other persons at the workplace also have duties under the WHS Act, such as\nthe duty to take reasonable care for their own health and safety at the workplace.\nA person can have more than one duty and more than one person can have the same duty\nat the same time.\nEarly consultation and identification of risks can allow for more options to eliminate or\nminimise risks and reduce the associated costs.\nThe main duties in relation to managing the risks of demolition work are set out in Chapter 2.\nPerson conducting a business or undertaking\nWHS Act section 19\nPrimary duty of care\nA PCBU must eliminate risks arising from demolition work, or if that is not reasonably\npracticable, minimise the risks so far as is reasonably practicable.\nThe WHS Regulation includes specific requirements for PCBUs to manage the risks of\nhazardous chemicals, airborne contaminants and plant, as well as other hazards associated\nwith demolition work.\nDemolition work Code of Practice 2021 Page 5 of 53\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nWHS Act section 19\nPrimary duty of care", "text_len": 2600, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This involves finding things and situations that could potentially cause harm\nto people. Hazards generally arise from the following aspects of work and their interaction:\n• physical work environment\n• equipment, materials and substances used\n• work tasks and how they are performed\n• work design and management.\nHazards may be identified by looking at the workplace and how work is carried out. It is also\nuseful to talk to workers, manufacturers, suppliers and health and safety specialists and\nreview relevant information, records and incident reports.\nPotential demolition hazards arise in a number of ways, including:\n• unplanned structure collapse\n• falls from one level to another\n• falling objects\nDemolition work Code of Practice 2021 Page 12 of 53\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nWHS Regulation section 34\nDuty to identify hazards\n\nWHS Regulation section 35\nManagement of risk\n\nWHS Regulation section36\nHierarchy of control measures\n\nWHS Regulation section 37\nMaintenance of control measures\n\nWHS Regulation section 38\nReview of control measures\n\nWHS Regulation section 297\nManagement of risks to health and safety\n\nWHS Regulation section 299\nSafe work method statement required for high risk construction work", "text_len": 2350, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

A risk assessment can help you determine:\n• how severe a risk is\n• whether any existing control measures are effective\n• what action you should take to control the risk\n• how urgently the action needs to be taken.\nHazards have the potential to cause different types and severities of harm, ranging from\nminor discomfort to a serious injury or death.\nMany hazards and their associated risks are well known and have well established and\naccepted control measures. In these situations, the second step in the process outlined in\nsection 1.3 of this Code to formally assess the risk is not required. If, after identifying a\nhazard, you already know the risk and how to control it effectively, you may simply\nimplement the controls.\nIn some circumstances, a risk assessment will assist to:\n• identify which workers are at risk of exposure\n• determine what sources and processes are causing the risk\n• identify if and what kind of control measures should be implemented\n• check the effectiveness of existing control measures.\nThe nature and severity of risks will depend on various factors, including the:\n• the structure to be demolished and its structural integrity\n• the method of demolition including its sequencing\n• the scheduling of the work\n• the layout of the workplace including whether there are fall hazards both for people\nand objects\n• what plant and equipment will be used and the skill and experience required by the\npeople who will use it safely\n• what exposures might occur, for example to noise or ultraviolet (UV) rays\n• the number of people involved\n• local weather conditions.\nFurther guidance on the risk management process and the hierarchy of control measures is\navailable in the How to manage work health and safety risks Code of Practice\nReview available information\nInformation and advice about hazards and risks relevant to particular industries and types of\nwork is available from regulators, industry associations, unions, technical specialists and\nsafety consultants.\nDemolition work Code of Practice 2021 Page 13 of 53", "text_len": 2744, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

These incidents need to be investigated to find the hazard that caused the\ninjury or illness.\n2.3 Controlling the risks\nWHS Regulation section 142\nNotice of demolition work\nThe hierarchy of control measures\nThe WHS Regulation requires duty holders to work through the hierarchy of control\nmeasures when managing certain risks; however, the hierarchy can be applied to any risk.\nThe hierarchy ranks control measures from the highest level of protection and reliability to\nthe lowest.\nEliminating the risk\nYou must always aim to eliminate the risk. For example, undertake work at ground level to\neliminate the use of cranes and the need to work at height. If eliminating the hazards and\nassociated risks is not reasonably practicable, you must minimise the risk by one or more of\nthe following:\n• Substitution—minimise the risk by substituting or replacing a hazard or hazardous work\npractice with something that gives rise to a lesser risk. For example, using a mechanical\ndemolition method rather than a manual method.\n• Isolation—minimise the risk by isolating or separating the hazard or hazardous work\npractice from any person exposed to it. For example, using concrete barriers to separate\npedestrians and powered mobile plant to reduce the risk of collision.\n• Engineering controls—engineering controls are physical control measures to minimise\nrisk. For example, fitting an open cab excavator with a protective structure to minimise\nthe risk of being struck by a falling object.\nIf risk remains, it must be minimised by implementing administrative controls, so far as is\nreasonably practicable, for example by installing warning signs.\nAny remaining risk must be minimised with suitable PPE, for example providing workers with\nhard hats, hearing protectors and high visibility vests.\nAdministrative control measures and PPE do not control the hazard at the source. They rely\non human behaviour and supervision and used on their own tend to be the least effective in\nminimising risks.\nChapters 4-6 of this Code provide information on control measures for demolition work.\nFurther guidance on the risk management process and the hierarchy of control measures is\navailable in the How to manage work health and safety risks Code of Practice.\nCombining control measures\nA combination of control measures may be used to minimise risks, so far as is reasonably\npracticable, if a single control is not sufficient for the purpose. In most cases, a combination\nDemolition work Code of Practice 2021 Page 14 of 53\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nWHS Regulation section 142\nNotice of demolition work", "text_len": 3031, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

If any new hazards are\ncreated they must also be controlled.\n2.4 Maintaining and reviewing control measures\nControl measures must be maintained so they remain fit for purpose, suitable for the nature\nand duration of work and installed, set up and used correctly.\nThe control measures put in place to protect health and safety should be regularly reviewed\nto make sure they are effective. Checking effectiveness may involve, for example air\nmonitoring to measure the concentration of crystalline silica in the worker’s breathing zone\nduring the abrasive blasting process. If the control measure is not working effectively it must\nbe revised to ensure it is effective in controlling the risk.\nYou must review and as necessary revise control measures so as to maintain, so far as is\nreasonably practicable, a work environment that is without risks to health or safety.\nFor example:\n• when the control measure does not control the risk, so far as is reasonably practicable\n• before a change at the workplace that is likely to give rise to a new or different risk to\nhealth and safety that the measure may not effectively control\n• a new or relevant hazard or risk is identified\n• the results of consultation indicate a review is necessary, or\n• a health and safety representative requests a review.\nCommon review methods include workplace inspection, consultation, testing and analysing\nrecords and data. Where demolition work is ‘high risk construction work’ a SWMS must also\nbe reviewed and revised where necessary.\nYou can use the same methods as in the initial hazard identification step to check control\nmeasures. You must also consult your workers and their health and safety representatives.\nIf problems are found, go back through the risk management steps, review your information\nand make further decisions about risk control.\nDemolition work Code of Practice 2021 Page 15 of 53", "text_len": 2235, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Vehicle buffers should be high enough to prevent the mobile plant from riding over\nthem and solid enough to stop the fully loaded mobile plant\n• at all levels below the working level, access to the area through or onto which material is\nfalling should be prevented, either by sealing off the opening with guarding from floor to\nceiling, or by erecting signs and barricades to prevent persons from coming near the\nopenings.\nDebris chutes should be designed and constructed to prevent the spillage of material and\ndust and to minimise noise while debris is passing through the chute. Vertical chutes should\nbe fully enclosed with a cover or barrier at the top to prevent a person falling into the chute.\nDebris chutes or shafts should be adequately secured to the building or structure and to\nensure debris falls freely and does not become jammed in them.

The first control measure is to, so far as is reasonably\npracticable, carry out the work on the ground or on a solid construction. A solid construction\nis an area that has:\n• a surface that is structurally capable of supporting all persons and things that may be\nlocated or placed on it\n• barriers around its perimeter and any openings to prevent a fall\n• an even and readily negotiable surface and gradient\n• a safe means of entry and exit.\nIf the risk of fall cannot be eliminated, it must be minimised by providing and maintaining a\nsafe system of work by implementing the following methods, in order, so far as is reasonably\npracticable:\n• providing a fall prevention device, for example temporary work platforms and guard rails\n• providing a work positioning system, for example industrial rope access systems\n• providing a fall arrest system, for example catch platforms.\nThese methods of providing a safe system of work must be implemented in order and the\nnext control can only be implemented if the previous control is not reasonably practicable,\nfor example the provision of a work position system can only be used as a method if it is not\nreasonably practicable to provide a fall protection device.\nConstruction work including demolition work involving a risk of a person falling more than\n2 metres is high risk construction work and a PCBU must ensure that a relevant SWMS is\nprepared before this work commences.\nFall prevention devices\nA fall prevention device can include material or equipment—or a combination of both—\ndesigned to prevent a fall when carrying out temporary work at heights that, once in place\nafter initial installation, does not require any ongoing adjustment, alteration or operation by\nany person to ensure the device’s integrity.\nFall prevention devices include secure fencing, edge protection, working platforms and\ncovers.\nFurther information on the selection and use of fall prevention devices can be found in the\nManaging the risk of falls at workplaces Code of Practice.\n4.9 Electricity\nConstruction work carried out on or near energised electrical installations or services is high\nrisk construction work and a PCBU involving this work must ensure that a SWMS is\nprepared before this work commences.\nDemolition work Code of Practice 2021 Page 33 of 53\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nWHS Regulation section 78\nManagement of risk of fall", "text_len": 2899, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Buildings and structures should generally be demolished in\nreverse order to their construction, that is, by ‘sequential demolition’. In particular:\n• sequential demolition should be carried out in reasonably even stages, commencing\nfrom the roof or top of the building or structure being demolished\n• multistorey buildings or structures should be demolished storey by storey\n• masonry and brickwork should be taken down in reasonably even courses.\nThere is a range of demolition methods that may be used, either separately or in\ncombination.

For example,\nusing an excavator with a hydraulic rock breaker or pulverising attachment to break up walls\nand floors while other load shifting equipment is used to shift the debris on a suspended floor\nwill result in a higher load. Because of the weight of the plant, the vibration caused by its\noperation and the build-up of debris, careful design and planning is needed to prevent a\npremature collapse of the structure.\nDemolition of walls\nWhen mobile plant, for example an excavator with a hydraulic rock breaker, is used to\ndemolish walls, at least 900 mm of the wall being demolished should be left intact above the\nfloor level to provide a protective barrier at the perimeter of the building and around lift wells,\nstairwells, light wells and other places where persons or objects could fall.

There must be sufficient clear space into which the collapsing\nmaterial will fall. The space should be large enough to contain the collapsed material and\nenable equipment and personnel to be removed to a safe distance prior to the collapse.\nFor further information on induced collapse methods refer to AS 2601: The demolition\nof structures.\nPre-weakening\nStructures which are not carrying their design loads may be pre-weakened prior to deliberate\ncollapse. This may involve removal of framework members and the partial cutting of\nloadbearing members. This pre-weakening should be carefully planned so, despite the pre-\nweakening, the remaining structure has sufficient strength to withstand wind or impact loads\nuntil the actual collapse is initiated.\nDead load can be reduced systematically by removing surplus material, machinery, roofs,\ncladding, walls and parts of floors before demolishing the structural frame.\nSometimes heavy loads are left at height to induce the collapse of the structure after\nmovement is initiated. If this system is adopted, it should be carefully analysed and\ndocumented by a competent person, for example a structural engineer to avoid\npremature collapse.\nWire rope, slings and chain pulling\nIf using wire rope, slings and chain pulling to demolish a structure, the pulling medium\nshould be a securely anchored winch or plant designed for towing and heavy enough to\napply the required tension without sliding or lifting from the surface on which it is located.\nThe wire rope, sling or chain should be long enough to ensure the horizontal distance from\nthe demolition work to the pulling medium is at least twice the height of the highest part to be\npulled. No person should be in a position where they could be struck by the wire rope, sling\nor chain in the event of a failure. The plant operator should be protected from rope breakage\nand flying debris. Exclusion zones should be established where necessary to protect the\nsafety of people who are working on or in the vicinity of the demolition work.\nBefore pulling of a wall commences, the wall should be cut into appropriate sections having\nregard to their height, width and construction. If it is not possible to isolate these sections,\nthe chains or wire ropes should be attached to their respective sections prior to the first pull\nbeing made. The free ends of the chains or ropes should be left a safe distance from the\nstructure. Vertical reinforcing bars should not be cut until after the wall has been pulled over.\nAll wire rope, slings and chains used in mechanical demolition should comply with the\nrelevant standards.\nFurther information on specifications for wire ropes, slings and chains can be found in:\nAS 1353 (set): Flat synthetic-webbing slings; AS 3775 (set): Chain slings for lifting purposes;\nAS 1666.1: Wire-rope slings – Product specification; AS 3569 (set): Steel wire ropes.

Controlling risks when demolishing special\nstructures\nSpecial structures are complex and/or unusual because of the nature of their construction or\ncondition. They include:\n• pre or post-tensioned construction\n• pre-cast concrete panel and framed structures\n• stressed skin structures such as buildings that rely on the sheeting, cladding or decking\nto stiffen and restrain the structural framework\n• slung structures i.e. floors or roofs suspended from a framework, supported by a\nstructural core.\nSpecial structures require proper planning and care to be demolished safely. An appropriate\ndemolition method and sequence should be selected and documented prior to the work\ncommencing. A demolition plan and an assessment by a competent person of the proposed\ndemolition method may assist with this process. A person conducting a business or\nundertaking (PCBU) carrying out this work must ensure that a SWMS is prepared where\nstructural elements are to be demolished.\n5.1 Pre and post-tensioned concrete\nPre-tensioned concrete contains tendons such as wires, strands or bars that have been\ntensioned before the concrete is placed.\nPost-tensioned concrete contains tendons that have been tensioned after the concrete has\nhardened.\nTensioned tendons require controlled removal because the high level of potential energy\nstored in the tendons poses a risk to the health and safety of workers and can cause\ndamage to property. It is also important to retain structural stability during and after tendon\nremoval, prior to the final demolition of the concrete element.\nThe tendons can be subject to corrosion that weakens them and decreases the structural\nintegrity of the building. Damage is not usually evident externally, even if strand breakage is\nextensive, and conditions can vary widely even within an individual structure.\nBefore demolishing pre or post-tensioned concrete elements, review all available\ndocumentation on the building or structure including:\n• building plans, designs and specifications—to understand the type of tensioning used,\nthe load carried, anchorage points and number of tendons\n• construction photographs—to obtain information on anchorage details, the construction\nsequencing, and other measures that may affect moisture access.\nThe condition of the concrete and tendons should be considered before and during\ndemolition, for example by:\n• conducting a visual inspection to confirm loads, obvious deviations from the original\ndesign and waterproofing details\n• assessing conditions throughout the building, as well as utilising selective testing in\nrepresentative areas to assess weakening or breakage of tendons\n• measuring humidity within tendon sheathing and analysing sheathing contaminants\n• removing, inspecting and testing a small number of tendons to assess their condition\n• continuing to monitor tendon tension.\nDemolition work Code of Practice 2021 Page 42 of 53", "text_len": 2903, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The PCBU should request a written report by a competent person specifying\nthe hazards associated with the design and the current state of the structure.\nControl measures should be taken, as far as is reasonably practicable, during the\nassessment and demolition stages.\nIn specifying the hazards associated with the design and current state of the structure, the\nreport by the competent person should also specify the control measures that should be\napplied to the demolition.\nWhere possible, fire damaged, ruinous or structurally unsound buildings or structures should\nbe demolished by mechanical means.\n5.3 Lift shafts\nThe combination of the lift shaft structure and the lift plant including the lift cage or car,\nwinders, counterweights, electrical supply and controls can make these complex structures.\nDifferent methods can be applied to lift demolition and these will depend on the\ncircumstances of the particular site.\nIn general, demolition procedures should include the following:\n• temporary support of the lift cage and the disconnection of electric power to all areas of\nthe lift machinery\n• lowering of counterweights to an appropriate level for disconnection and the unwinding of\ncables in a controlled manner prior to the removal of drums\n• provision of temporary decking in the lift shaft\n• progressive demolition of the lift shaft walls onto existing floors\n• removal of debris.\n5.4 Basements, cellars, vaults, domes and arched roofs\nDuring the demolition of a basement, cellar, arch, vault or dome frequent inspections should\nbe made to identify whether there has been unplanned movement. If unplanned movement\nis detected, appropriate action should be taken to avoid uncontrolled collapse.\nIf a basement, cellar, vault or void adjoins another property, adjoining walls should be\ninspected by a competent person to determine whether they are strong enough to withstand\nthe resultant ground pressure. If they are not, the proposed methods of strengthening them\nshould be subject to an assessment by a competent person, for example a\nstructural engineer.\nIf a basement has been built in ground with a high water table, measures should be taken,\nas far as is reasonably practicable, to prevent collapse as a result of hydraulic pressure,\nuncontrolled water inrush or flotation.\nDemolition work Code of Practice 2021 Page 43 of 53", "text_len": 2936, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The spandrel infilling should only be removed down to the springing line as\nthe load-carrying capacity of many old arches relies on the filling between the spandrels.\nIn multi-span arches, lateral restraints should be provided at the springing level before\nindividual spans are removed.\n5.6 Independent chimneys and spires\nA detailed inspection and survey should be completed prior to the demolition of a chimney or\nspire. In particular, the condition of the structural material, which can range from stone and\nbrick to steel, timber and concrete, needs to be assessed to identify faults, such as fractured\nor badly weathered stone or rotten timbers.\nMeasurements may need to be taken to determine whether there is deviation from the\nperpendicular. The possibility of chimney instability resulting from inclement weather, for\nexample during high winds, needs to be considered during all stages of demolition work.\nDue to their height, it is common for chimneys to be demolished by hand or through induced\ncollapse. Temporary supports may be required to ensure premature collapse does not occur.\nHand demolition should be carried out progressively from the top of the chimney and from\nsafe working platforms.\nDue to their height, control measures that should be considered when demolishing chimneys\nor spires include:\n• temporary work platforms\n• falling object protection\n• exclusion zones\n• dust control.\nInduced collapse will require sufficient clear space, approximately 1.5 times the total height\nof the chimney and of sufficient width depending on the type of structure.\n5.7 Pylons and masts\nIf using hand demolition, a pylon or mast should be dismantled in the reverse order to that in\nwhich it was erected. If another method is used, such as demolition by wire rope pulling,\nplanning that includes the provision of adequate clear space will be required.\n5.8 Precast concrete panels\nIf a structure is composed of a series of reinforced precast concrete panels, an inspection of\nthe fixings to the rest of the structural elements, jointing between elements, and the lifting\npoints or fittings should be undertaken to establish their nature and condition before\ndemolition of the structure begins.\nWhere possible, the panels should be removed by a crane in the reverse sequence to that\nused for their erection.

The demolition method(s) used should take into account the limits imposed by\nthe planned facade retention.\nUse guarding, hoarding and/or exclusion zones to protect persons against the risk of being\nstruck by falling debris and materials.\nThe facade or footings may need to be repaired and temporary support for the facade may\nneed to be installed before demolition work commences.
