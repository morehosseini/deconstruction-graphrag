The\nresulting products obtainable from recycled timber will therefore reflect previous use, and\navailability of individual species/species mixes, grades and products may change with\ntime.\n(b) Detailed discussions between purchasers and suppliers prior to specifying or ordering\nrecycled timber is the key to a successful commercial transaction.\n(c) Where practical, prior inspection should be undertaken of realistic representative sample\nof recycled timber product and that the grade/quality is agreed upon in writing between\npurchaser and supplier. The use of actual samples, electronic images etc, where\navailable, may assist in facilitating satisfactory placement and delivery of the order.\n(d) It should be noted that the grades available under this standard are specific to recycled\ntimber and include recycled timber features.\nIn respect of the application of this Standard:\n• Statements expressed in mandatory terms in NOTES to tables or diagrams are\ndeemed to be requirements of this Standard.\n• NOTES to text contain general information and guidance. They are not an integral\npart of the Standard.\nThe terms ‘normative’ and ‘informative’ have been used in this Standard to define the\napplication of the Appendix to which they apply. A ‘normative’ Appendix is an integral part of\nthis Standard, whereas an ‘informative’ Appendix is only for information and guidance.\nFWPA Standard G01 Recycled Timber – Visually Graded for Structural Purposes 2025, Ed. 1.0", "text_len": 2001, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Recycled\ntimber is timber that has been previously used and served its initial purpose. Recycled\ntimber may be recovered from use for re-use either in its original cross-sectional size or re-\nmanufactured to smaller dimensions. Whilst this document is specific to hardwood, some\nguidance on the use of recycled softwood is also provided in Appendix C.\nThis Standard covers:–\n• Small end-section timbers less than 0.012 m2 (e.g. 200 mm x 50 mm) from\no timber that has been sawn from larger members (e.g. girders, power poles)\no structural timber recovered from previous use (e.g. floor joists, roof framing)\n• Large end-section members greater than 0.012 m2 (e.g. 300 mm x 300 mm) in cross-\nsection that have been recovered from previous use (e.g. girders) or have been sawn from\nlarger members.\nNOTE For lightly loaded (non-structural) large section recycled hardwood, refer to FWPA Standard G02\nRecycled Timber - Visually Graded Decorative Products.\n1.2 Application\nThis Standard recognises that structural recycled hardwood will contain characteristics and\nbe of dimensions that are included in AS 2082 and AS 3818, however recycled timber also\ncontains characteristics that differ in nature from ‘new’ sawn timber covered by those two\nstandards including age effects which need consideration. This Standard, while similar in\nmany aspects to the ‘new’ sawn standards, is to be used independently of them and is\nspecifically for use with recycled timber only.\n1.3 Referenced Documents\nThe following documents are referred to in this Standard:\nAS/NZS 1604.1 Preservative-treated wood-based products Part 1 Products and treatment\nAS 1684 Residential timber-framed construction (series)\nAS 1720.1 Timber structures, Part 1: Design Methods\nAS 2082 Timber – Hardwood – Visually stress graded for structural purposes\nFWPA Standard G01 Recycled Timber – Visually Graded for Structural Purposes 2025, Ed. 1.0", "text_len": 2106, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Each\npiece shall be inspected on all surfaces and the ends.\n2.5.2 Limitations\nThe grade descriptions in Section 3 provide limitations on all characteristics known to have a\nsignificant effect on strength and describe material on the lower limit of that grade. Each\nparcel of small end-section timber used in structural applications shall contain a range of\nmaterial such that not all of the material is near the lower limits of the grade.\n2.5.3 Variations in Assessment\nWithin any parcel a maximum variation of 5 percent between the grading of pieces by\nindividual inspectors or graders shall be acceptable, provided that none of the pieces in the\ndisputed 5 percent shall have characteristics that exceed the maximum allowed in the grade\nby more than 10 percent.\n2.5.4 Re-sawing and dressing\nIf the cross-section of the piece of timber is reduced by longitudinal sawing or dressing after\nthe initial assignment of a recycled grade, the original grading is nullified.\n2.5.5 Docking of multiple lengths\nWhen grading a piece of timber that is to be supplied as a multiple of a shorter ordered\nlength it shall be graded as if it were in the shorter length.\n2.5.6 Moisture content of preservative treated timber\nWhere timber is seasoned and subsequently preservative treated, the preservative treatment\nprocess may increase the moisture content of timber considerably. Unless such timber is re-\ndried (low temperature) to the moisture content range for seasoned timber it does not\nconform to the requirements of this Standard for seasoned timber.\n2.5.7 Grading Check\nA check of the grading of the timber may be required sometime after the grading undertaken\nby the producer or supplier. Where the purpose of the check is to estimate the accuracy of\nthe previous grading, reasonable allowance shall be made for changes in characteristics of\nthe timber that are the result of moisture change. These changes in characteristics may\ninclude but are not limited to:–\n(a) changes in dimensions reduction in dimensions swelling or shrinkage;\n(b) increase in distortion (bow, spring, twist and cup);\nincrease in, or development of, seasoning checks, splits, end splits and shakes; and\n(c) increase in, or development of, loose gum veins.\nFWPA Standard G01 Recycled Timber – Visually Graded for Structural Purposes 2025, Ed. 1.0", "text_len": 2632, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

All of these effects tend to create mechanical damage, which must be taken into\naccount when using recycled timbers in structural applications.\nIn order to quantify these effects, particularly in regard to their influence on strength and\nstiffness properties, a comprehensive testing program was undertaken as a part of the\nresearch and development program that supports this Standard. Whilst details of this testing\nare reported elsewhere, a number of salient features are discussed below.\nC.2 Strength and Stiffness\nOne of the important outcomes of the testing program was recognition that the traditional\nrelationship between strength and stiffness inherent in the F-grade system, does not apply in\nthe same way as for new timber.\nEssentially, the strength reduction effect observed in testing means that if a piece of recycled\ntimber is visually graded using AS 2082 or AS 3818, then the F grade for that piece is\nnominally two F-grades lower, than would apply for a ’new’ piece of the same species and\nstructural grade.\nHowever, it is important to note, that the same reduction was not observed to apply for\nstiffness. This means that if a piece of timber is graded in accordance with the provisions of\nthis Standard the stiffness, E, can be assumed to be that equivalent to ‘new’ timber.\nTherefore, the characteristic strength, stiffness and other design considerations noted below\nfor recycled structural timber do not align with the traditional ‘F’ grade properties given in AS\n1720.1.\nTable C1 provides recommended characteristic strength and stiffness for recycled hardwood\ntimber graded in accordance with this Standard. Where recycled structural timber is\nproposed to be used in critical structural applications, designers and specifiers should\nconsider specific structural or proof testing to satisfy themselves of the required\ncharacteristic strengths.\nNOTE: A conservative approach has been taken by lowering the strength equivalent to two F-grades because the\nhistory of the recycled timber use may be unknown. Where the history of the timber is known, a one F-grade\nreduction may be applied. Individual operators/suppliers may conduct their own testing and may provide\nverification of strength by other means to supply timber of material properties different to those proposed in Table\nC.1. Refer to Section C.3 for consideration of the duration of load factor k1 if strength values other than those\ndescribed in Table C.1 may be used.\nFWPA Standard G01 Recycled Timber – Visually Graded for Structural Purposes 2025, Ed. 1.0", "text_len": 3170, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The question then arises, do the same factors have to be applied when designing a\nnew structure using recycled timber?\nIn the case of recycled timbers, the 5th percentile strength observed from testing varied\nbetween approximately 55% and 65% of that for new timbers of the same visual grading,\ndepending on the previous loading history. In most cases, this previous loading history will\nbe unknown and as such it is appropriate to adopt a slightly conservative approach in\nrecommending design properties. The general observation is that most recycled timbers\nhave been subjected to an accumulated duration of loading somewhere between 5 months\nand 50 years.\nA review of Madsen’s work1 that details testing and derivation of models used to account for\nthe duration of load effect indicates the phenomenon is not linear but progressive, slowing\ngradually with time. The k terms presented in AS1720.1 have been derived by utilising this\n1\nsame method of gradual loss of strength with increasing accumulated times of loading. This\ncan be clearly seen in Figure C.1.\n1\nMadsen, Borg – Structural Behaviour of Timber, 1992; ISBN 0-9696162-0-1.\nFWPA Standard G01 Recycled Timber – Visually Graded for Structural Purposes 2025, Ed. 1.0\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nSpecies\nGroup\n(table\nB1) | Recycled\nGrade\n(Sect. 3) | Characteristic Strength, MPa |  |  |  | Short\nduration*\nmodulus of\nelasticity\nparallel to\nthe grain,\nMPa (E) | Short\nduration\nmodulus of\nrigidity\nparallel to\nthe grain,\nMPa (G)\n |  | Bending\n(f’b) | tension\nparallel\nto grain\n(f’t) | Shear\nin\nbeams\n(f’s) | Compression\nParallel to\nGrain\n(f’c) |  | \nA | RG1 | 50 | 30 | 4.3 | 40 | 18 500 | 930\n | RG2 | 40 | 25 | 3.7 | 30 | 16 000 | 800\nB | RG1 | 40 | 25 | 3.7 | 30 | 16 000 | 800\n | RG2 | 35 | 20 | 3.1 | 25 | 14 000 | 700\nC | RG1 | 35 | 15 | 3.1 | 25 | 14 000 | 700\n | RG2 | 25 | 12 | 2.5 | 20 | 12 000 | 610\nD | RG1 | 25 | 12 | 2.5 | 20 | 12 000 | 610\n | RG2 | 20 | 9.7 | 2.1 | 15 | 10 500 | 530", "text_len": 2890, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

A further 100 years of\nloading (total 200 years) would result in a further reduction to 0.48. However, adding a\nfurther 5 months of accumulated loading, which is typical for normal occupancy load events,\nwould change the value of k by less than 0.5% – in other words, it is negligible. A\n1\nconservative approach for applying k to recycled structural timber that will be put back into\n1\nservice, would be to reduce the characteristic properties for occupancy loads by 2%, and for\npermanent loads by 10%.\nThe important thing to note is that application of a duration of load factor for recycled timber\nis very different than that for new timber. Based on this review, the following values of k are\n1\nrecommended for designs utilising recycled timbers which are graded to this Standard with\nthe characteristic properties given in Table C.1 for recycled hardwood. Where strength\nvalues greater than those described in this Standard have been provided by the supplier, this\nmay indicate the timber has not reached a high level of load reduction from the duration of\nload effect. As such, the k values used in conjunction with higher characteristic strength\n1\nvalues than described in Table C.1 of this Standard may be taken as the k values for new\n1\ntimber described in AS 1720.1 The structural engineer shall ensure that the appropriate k\n1\nvalue has been used in conjunction with the characteristic strength values provided by the\nindividual operators/suppliers.\nFWPA Standard G01 Recycled Timber – Visually Graded for Structural Purposes 2025, Ed. 1.0\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n | \n |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  | ", "text_len": 2139, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The effect of edge\nnotches of any size in a “zone” subject to bending moment is quite severe and results in\na significant loss of strength when compared to the bending capacity of an un-notched\nsection. However, notches and holes in the vicinity of the neutral axis have a negligible\neffect on strength and stiffness.\nFor these reasons the “safe zones” for bolt holes and notches have been carefully\ndefined in Section 3, and even where edge notches or holes may be permitted near the\nsupports, designers are advised to check the member capacity using the relevant\nprovisions of AS 1720.1 for beams.\nC.6 Design of Connections\nTable B1 notes the joint classifications for specific timber species referenced in this\nStandard. These joint classifications are based upon density of the timber, which for re-\ncycled timber does not change significantly from the “as new” state.\nHowever, there is evidence that some reduction in connector strength due to previous load\nhistory occurs and as such, the characteristic capacities for each of the joint groups as\ndefined in the relevant Tables of AS1720.1, should be reduced by multiplying the specified\nvalue by 0.8 (a reduction allowance of 20%).\nThe appropriate values for k (duration of load) for the connections in structural members\n1\ndesigned using recycled timber, are given in Table C.2.\nFWPA Standard G01 Recycled Timber – Visually Graded for Structural Purposes 2025, Ed. 1.0\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nType of Load | Assumed accumulated duration | Value of k\n1\nAll short term loads | Less than 5 days | 1.0\nOccupancy loads | Up to 5 months | 0.98\nPermanent loads | Over 5 months | 0.90", "text_len": 2426, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
