AUDIT AND RISK\nThe WMRR Board is supported\nby three (3) committees:\nThe Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) is a sub-committee\nwithin the national board of the Waste Management and\nResource Recovery Association of Australia (the\nAssociation). The ARC monitors the integrity of financial\nstatements and assists in approving external auditing\npolicies and procedures. It also considers the ongoing\nassessment of current and emerging risks in the\nAssociation’s operations.\nThe key objectives of the Committee are to:\nApprove the terms of engagement for the audit officer\nand scope,\nMonitor the integrity of financial statements, and\nReview the Association’s arrangements.\nThe ARC is composed of Phil Carbins, Michelle Mandl, Gayle\nSloan, and Isabel Axiö (Chair), supported by Lisa Lepore.\nSince July 2023, the committee has:\nReviewed the items and weighting of the registered\nrisks, making minor updates for WMRR, which were\napproved by the board.\nDiscussed and reviewed the proposed 2025 budget,\nsought clarification on figure comparisons with previous\nyears and a few line items. The ARC sought and gained\napproval for the budget from the board.\nThe ARC is satisfied that the Association is managing\noperational risk and its finances with awareness, care, and\ndiligence. As the WARR sector grows, the Association\nremains fiercely relevant in an increasingly competitive\nspace. This is demonstrated by sustained growth in\nmemberships, attendance at events, and engagement\nfrom governments.\nThere was a marginal loss recorded for the 2024 calendar\nyear due to increased cost of event delivery, travel and\ngeneral operation, as well as lower-than-expected revenue\nfrom exhibitors and sponsors.
