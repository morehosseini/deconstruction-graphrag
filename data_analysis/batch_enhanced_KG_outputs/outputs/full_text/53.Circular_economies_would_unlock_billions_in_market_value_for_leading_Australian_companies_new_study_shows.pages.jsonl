We need to shift our thinking from\nvolume to value. That’s how you incentivise action. Businesses are much more likely to act if\nthey know they could unlock huge savings through sharing, leasing, repairing and recycling\nexiting resources,” said Ms Griffin.\n\nLisa McLean, Managing Director and CEO of Circular Australia said with a circularity rate of\naround four per cent, Australia’s journey to build a circular economy will require many system\nchanges.\n\n“Breaking through the barriers to build new circular markets is essential to Australia’s\neconomic resilience. This presents opportunities to not just cut embodied carbon but secure\ngreater productivity and efficiencies, while creating the products and services of the future -\nwithout waste.”\n\nThe report points to the richness of Australia’s resources as an example of the value that\nindustries lose in supply chains by failing to harness circular principles. As global demand\ngrows for the lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles, Australia’s economy benefits from\nthe extraction of resources but misses opportunities in the value chain to manufacture\nbatteries or remanufacture and recycle spent batteries. In 2023, Australia formed 39 per cent\nof global lithium extraction, but almost all (94 per cent) of lithium-ion batteries are recycled\noffshore, resulting in lost value of up to $3.1 billion each year.\n\nConversely, markets that better embrace circular thinking can capture this value. The report\ncalls out Redwood Materials in the US, which recycles materials from end-of-life batteries and\nelectronics. They formed supply chain partnerships with large organisations such as\nPanasonic, Ford, and Amazon to ensure they have enough supply to refine battery materials\nand remanufacture anode and cathode components which are sold to the growing local battery\nmanufacturing industry.\n\nIn the Australian context, the report emphasises the importance of government in unlocking\nthese opportunities as viable for businesses. Mature circular economies are enabled by\ngovernment policies and legislation that incentivise good outcomes and disincentivise negative\nones. To combat issues around low-quality fast fashion, France is proposing levies that would\n\f", "text_len": 2842, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

They could reduce gate fees for recycling and\nentice contractors to dismantle and sort materials instead of sending the lot to landfill. For us to\nrealise the massive benefits of a circular economy, it will be critical that we have the right fiscal\nand policy settings to encourage targeted investment, financing and collaboration,” Ms Griffin\nconcluded.\n\nView the report: Unlocking circular markets in Australia >\n\nNews\n\nExplore more Asia Pacific news\n\nSee more —>\n\nNews\n\nAmanda Yeates appointed as Arup’s Roads and Streets\nLeader for Australia and New Zealand\n\n7th February 2026\n\nNews\n\nArup-led Digital Twin project wins ISOCARP Awards 2025\nGrand Award\n\n27th January 2026\n\n \n\f", "text_len": 1106, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
