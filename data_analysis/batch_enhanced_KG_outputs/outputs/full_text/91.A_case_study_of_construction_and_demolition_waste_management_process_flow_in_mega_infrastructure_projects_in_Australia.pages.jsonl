The rapid growth of population and associated urbanization and economic\ndevelopment calls for increased demand for infrastructure development to meet ongoing and\nfuture demands. A better understanding of the waste management (WM) processes would help\nto manage large volumes of waste effectively at construction sites, maximise the value of\nresources and improve environmental and economic performances. This research aims to\ninvestigate the WM processes associated with different types of construction and demolition\n(C&D) waste generated by a mega infrastructure project through a case study approach,\ncombining expert interviews and project-specific document reviews. The case studied project\ndemonstrated high environmental and economic sustainability outcomes and exceeded the C&D\nWM targets, signifying more than 90% landfill diversion rates for both spoil and construction\nwaste generated during the construction stage. As such, the infrastructure projects have a great\npotential to maximise the reuse of high-value waste through waste exchange across projects and\ngain economic and environmental benefits, while leading to paving a path to greener Australia\nin near future. The outcome of this case study is a WM process flow diagram (PFD) that maps\nout the WM processes, waste fates and associated waste flows involved with the diverse range\nof C&D waste throughout its life cycle. The PFD developed in this study serves as an operational\ntool to develop effective WM plans for construction projects of similar nature and thus helps to\nachieve higher landfill diversion rates. The outcome of this study can also contribute to the\ndevelopment of a generic WM PFD for the C&D waste stream.\n1. Introduction\nWaste generated from the construction and demolition (C&D) sector increasingly becomes a major issue\nfrom the perspective of economic, environmental and social sustainability. During the last decade, the\nconstruction industry in Australia contributed to the growth of C&D waste generation by 32% per capita\n[1], comparatively showing an emerging and different trend in waste generation from the other two core\nwaste streams: Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and Commercial & Industrial (C&I). Most of the growth\nin C&D waste generation in the past years has resulted from the unprecedented levels of residential and\nContentfromthisworkmaybeusedunderthetermsoftheCreativeCommonsAttribution3.0licence.Anyfurtherdistribution\nofthisworkmustmaintainattributiontotheauthor(s)andthetitleofthework,journalcitationandDOI.\nPublishedunderlicencebyIOPPublishingLtd 1", "text_len": 3040, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

At the same\ntime, the construction of mega infrastructure projects such as roads, underground motorway\ninterchanges with tunnels, railways, light rail networks and airports within highly urbanised\nenvironments faces several challenges [2] and creates detrimental impacts on the environment and social\nhealth in both short and long terms [3]. In particular, the high volume of waste and noise generated\nduring the construction phase of these projects have a direct impact on the environment and human\nhealth while air pollution, reduced liveability of urban environments and the environmental impacts of\nmaterials used by the transport system have an indirect impact [4].\nThe future reputation of these types of projects, therefore, depends on how these projects are\naccountable for managing the waste effectively, thus not allowing the industry to move towards a\nresource-constrained economy. Rethinking and revising the relationship between resources and the\neconomy and setting targets to achieve waste reduction and a high level of resource recovery becomes\nessential to thrive the industry to move towards the circular economy. According to Esmaeilian et al.\n[5], efforts from traditional waste management practices have failed to consider the complete material\nlifecycle, i.e. cradle-to-grave pattern of material usage. Yet, circular economy opportunities are\nemerging to create a waste value chain from the entire product lifecycle. A better understanding of WM\nprocesses involved in the life cycle of different types of waste generated from construction projects\nwould lead to efficient waste and resource management in construction projects and it, in turn, will\nreduce waste footprint and provide more opportunities for circularity of waste within the economy.\nInfrastructure projects generate a wide range of C&D waste due to their nature, involving widespread\nactivities associated with demolition, bulk excavation, earthwork and construction and hence become\nthe large waste generator among other projects [6]. However, existing studies in the infrastructure\ndevelopment projects mainly focus on environmental impacts that are related to the effects on\ngroundwater, noise and vibration, pollution and geological impacts such as erosion during the\nconstruction [3]. There is a lack of exploration of WM processes and waste material flows associated\nwith different types of C&D waste generated by different types of projects throughout the waste life\ncycle. A few studies have investigated the WM process during the construction stage. For instance, Shen\net al. [7] examined the waste handling processes on-site through a case study approach and mapped out\nthe most common processes at a high level, considering it as an alternative method for examining on-\nsite WM. However, interim processes or WM pathways involved with the common categories of C&D\nwere not addressed by past studies. This study focused on examining the waste management (WM)\nprocesses involved with different categories of waste generated by one of the mega transportation\ninfrastructure projects in New South Wales (NSW), throughout the waste life cycle. The study also\naddresses the sustainable approaches implemented to achieve higher waste diversion targets set by the\nproject.\n2. Construction and demolition waste management process\nAccording to the National Waste Report 2020 [1], the term ‘waste management’ is generally used to\ndefine the type of facility that receives and manages the waste (e.g. landfill, waste processing facility,\ncompost facility, alternative waste treatment facility, etc.). WM processes are considered to be of two\ntypes: pathways and waste fates or end destinations. Pathways are the interim steps involved with the\nmovement of waste materials from their generation phase to the end destination. They consist of the\nprocesses such as short-term storage, stockpiling, treatment, sorting, processing and export [1]. A\nprocess is defined as the transportation, transformation, or storage of materials (E.g. a processing facility\ntransforming plastic into marketable commodities), while the waste collection is referred to as a man-\nmade transport process. Waste fate denotes the type of actions that take place once the waste is generated\nand sometimes it may differ from ‘management’ types of waste. For instance, most waste types have\nthe management as ‘landfill’, but specify the fate as ‘disposal’. Fates are categorised into disposal,\nrecycling/remanufacturing, energy recovery and long-term storage.

Since WM is linked with economic, environmental,\ninstitutional, social, and political aspects [11, 12], managing the high volume of C&D waste generated\nby infrastructure projects has become a challenging task for both industry and government. The major\ngoals of WM, therefore, should focus on waste avoidance and minimisation through maximising the\nwaste reuse and recycling and waste to energy options while simultaneously promoting the institutional,\neconomic, environmental and social performance of C&D WM at project, industry and national levels\n[13]. In particular, infrastructure projects, which involve tunnelling and bulk excavations generate a\nsignificant volume of spoil and therefore systematic planning is essential to ensure that the spoil is\nmanaged effectively to comply with the legislative requirements [14].\n3. Research Methodology\nThis study primarily adopted a case study approach, combining expert interviews and project-specific\ndocument reviews to collect the required data. In order to map the WM processes involved in a\nconstruction project, it is essential to identify and understand the WM processes and waste materials\nflow associated with each category of waste generated by that project, from the waste generation phase\nto the end destination phase. This requires capturing the processes, decisions, waste data, and\nstakeholders involved in each of the main processes of WM. The case study approach using interviews\nwith industry experts has been considered a more appropriate approach to achieve this objective. The\ninterviewees were selected using a purposive sampling method based on their experience and\ninvolvement with on-site and off-site WM of the project. Accordingly, three interviews: one from the\nconstruction organisation (to identify the on-site WM processes), one from waste collection and\ntransportation service (to identify the processes related to waste collection and transportation to the\nrecycling facility and/or landfill site), and one from WM and recycling services (to identify the off-site\nWM processes) were conducted. These interviews were semi-structured interviews with some guide\nquestions accompanied by a theoretical C&D WM process flow diagram (PFD).\nA PFD is a graphical representation of a system that demonstrates the primary processes and the\nflows between the processes involved in a system. PFDs are generally used to document a process,\nimprove a process, or model a new process, the purpose of which varies with its use and content. Thus,\nfunctional process flow mapping techniques were used to develop the theoretical diagram and the\ndiagram was developed through a comprehensive literature review. The theoretical C&D WM PFD was\npresented to the interviewees as the guide and the interviewees were requested to review and verify the\nproject-specific WM processes involved in the studied infrastructure project. The collective output of\nthe interviews and the data collected through the review of project-specific documents were used to\nrefine and develop the PFD for the project. Processes that are specific to the project were considered in\nrefining the diagram. The refined project-specific PFD developed went through a final review process\nby the same interviewees and their constructive feedback assisted to validate the diagram.\n4. Case study: Infrastructure project\n4.1. Profile of the project\nThe project is one of the major transportation infrastructures of the NSW government in Australia. It\ncomprises the construction of around 24 km long tunnel combining a carriage place and ventilation\ntunnels, underground substation and permanent ventilation facilities, general surface work, rebuilding\nof bridges, roads and upgrading of the roads around where the tunnels come out and link with service\nnetwork, pavement and drainage. The project value is around 7 billion Australian dollars with a\nconstruction period of 5 years and delivered by tier 1-construction companies through a joint venturing\n3", "text_len": 4504, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

It was an ongoing project during the conduct of the\ncase study.\n4.2. Overview of the Construction and Demolition Waste Management\nA wide range of activities, which include demolition, site establishment, bulk excavation, tunnelling and\ncutting, and construction, involved in this project have generated several waste streams. Major\ncategories of waste, their types, and the sources of each waste category generated by the project are\nsummarised in Table 1. Waste classification guidelines established by the NSW Environment Protection\nAuthority [15] have been followed in on-site waste segregation of project-specific waste. A general skip\nbin also was provided to store the construction waste into one bin in some parts of the sites, where\nlimited space is available to place multiple bins, and the mixed waste is to be sorted off-site by the\nnominated WM contractor. Bins labelled with colour coding have been provided at all project site offices\nto guide on-site workers to sort the waste according to their types. Relevant guidelines and legislative\nand licensing requirements for segregation, reuse, storage, transportation and disposal of waste, which\nhave been established by the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (POEO Act) have been\nconsidered in the assessment of all types of waste and development of Waste Management Plan (WMP).\nTable 1.

The WMP\nspecifies the standard C&D waste mitigation and management measures and sustainability requirements\nthat are essential to manage and control the potential impacts from waste generation and resource\nrecovery during the construction of the project. The specified measures have been considered based on\nthe principles of the waste and resource management hierarchy stipulated in the WARR Act 2001, NSW.\nFurther, effective management of the C&D waste (minimisation, storage, handling, transportation,\ntreatment, reuse, recycling and lawful disposal of waste) with the emphasis on protecting the\nenvironmental values through its life cycle was considered and defined as one of the preferred\nenvironmental performance outcomes in the environmental impact statement (EIS) prepared for the\nproject.\nThe Environment and Sustainability Manager and Project Managers are responsible for the overall\nmanagement of C&D waste generated during the construction across all the project sites. The manager\nwho is responsible for approvals and environmental sustainability makes sure that the construction\nactivities are carried out to fulfilling the general project requirements under the CoA and comply with\nthe legislation and contractual obligations. The same manager deals with regulatory authorities like\nDPIE, EPA and RMS to facilitate the execution of the project from the environmental perspective. From\nthe sustainability perspective, the same manager is accountable for achieving the contractual targets in\nWM-related sustainability. It is imperative to note that this project has established target rates and key\nperformance indicators for the reuse/recycling of spoil generated by bulk excavation and tunnelling\nworks and waste generated by C&D activities. The target rates were decided based on the type of waste\nto be generated as this project falls under the infrastructure category. The rates include 80% for\nreuse/recycling of both reusable excavated materials (i.e. spoil excluding contaminated materials such\nas Asbestos contaminated materials) and C&D waste (inert and non-hazardous materials). The waste\nrecovery targets were set by the joint ventures in collaboration with the project’s client and not regulated\nby DPIE. Moreover, the project targets to achieve the Infrastructure Sustainability (IS) rating developed\nby the Infrastructure Sustainability Council of Australia (ISCA). Waste is one of the major themes\nincluded in IS rating scheme which consistently evaluates sustainability across the design, construction\nand operation of infrastructure.\n4.3. Mapping the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Processes\nAs mentioned in section 4.2, the investigation of the case study revealed that this project has adopted\nWM strategies in accordance with the principles of the waste hierarchy and legal requirements stipulated\nfor the project, to achieve efficient use of resources and avoid any significant risk to the environment\nand social health. Being an infrastructure project, involving demolition, bulk excavation and tunnelling\nand construction works, the project has demonstrated various on-site and off-site WM practices to\nmanage different types of C&D waste generated. The C&D WM PFD captures those on-site and off-\nsite WM processes and their fates associated with major categories of common and project-specific\nwaste from the waste generation phase to the destination. Figure 1 portrays the C&D WM PFD\nspecifically developed for the infrastructure project studied. The diagram incorporates the on-site waste\nhandling and management processes, off-site WM processes and waste flows associated with each major\ncategory of waste. These processes are grouped under four main processes namely: (1) waste collection\n& transportation, (2) waste reuse off-site, (3) waste recycling/reprocessing, and (4) waste treatment and\ndisposal. It also addresses the legal requirements (highly recommended by NSW EPA) related to each\nprocess that are to be considered in managing waste on-site and off-site. The following sub-sections\ndiscuss the processes associated with each main function in detail.\n5", "text_len": 4352, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

On-site waste handling and management\nWith regards to the on-site WM, the generation of waste from demolition, excavation and construction\nis the first process that occurs on-site followed by the initial segregation of waste by on-site workers.\nThe site delegate foreman is responsible to make sure that all the legal requirements are followed in\naccordance with the EPA waste classification guidelines for on-site waste separation at each location.\nThe follow-up processes of waste generation vary with the type of waste generated. However, they\ncomprise main processes; particularly waste sorting, stockpiling/storing in dedicated bins, minor\nprocessing, reusing, minor treatment and collection and transportation of waste by a waste contractor\nfor off-site reuse, recycling and disposal as shown in Figure 1. Processes related to demolition waste\ninvolve almost similar processes. Waste such as concrete, asphalt, blocks/brick and gravel is\nstockpiled/stored in skip bins, crushed and reused on-site as backfill, road base and on access tracks/road\nmaintenance. Vegetation waste is stockpiled and reused on-site as mulch for landscaping as well as off-\nsite in accordance with mulch exemption and unused waste is disposed of at a licensed facility. Scrap\nmetals are sorted and stored in delegated bins and transported for off-site recycling.\nHazardous waste such as asbestos (and asbestos-contained materials) is temporarily stored on-site in\na bunded facility until transported for off-site disposal. Special waste such as acid sulfate soil is subject\nto an on-site treatment process before disposing off-site at a licensed landfill site. It involves the\nformation of bunded lined treatment area where materials are brought out from the ground and mixed\nwith lime. The lime is utilised to soak up the acid as outlined in the special waste treatment management\nplan, which has been developed in consultation with an independent soil scientist. The treated soil is\nretested to make sure that it meets the disposal requirements of the acid sulfate soil in accordance with\nthe waste classification guidelines.\nExcavated materials, i.e. spoil (VENM or ENM) are categorised appropriately in accordance with\nthe guidelines and exemption requirements and stockpiled on-site separately based on their type for\nreusing. Reuse is the process of using the waste materials again (the reallocation of materials) in their\noriginal state for the same purpose or a different purpose without reprocessing or remanufacturing [8,\n16]. Following sampling and testing of spoil, uncontaminated spoil has been reused on-site (within the\nproject) for the backfill of retaining walls, infill of temporary access shafts, declines, landscaping and\nsite rehabilitation purposes as well as in rail yards for contamination remediation. Excess materials are\nlawfully disposed of off-site at a licensed site by licensed contractors. Contaminated materials are\nsegregated from uncontaminated material and stockpiled/stored on-site in suitable hardstand or lined\nareas to prevent cross-contamination. Required sampling and testing are carried out for contaminants\nbefore reusing and transporting to off-site for reuse/disposal to ensure that it meets the reuse/disposal\nrequirements.\nExcept for liquid waste (LW), most of the construction waste is subject to similar processes\nassociated with demolition waste and on-site treatment is excluded for construction waste. Waste\nmaterials such as concrete and asphalt are stockpiled and reused on-site followed by the process of\ncrushing. These waste types are also stored in appropriate bins and reused/recycled off-site in\naccordance with reclaimed asphalt. Timber formwork is reused on-site and stored in general skip bins\nfor off-site separation and recycling as well. Scrap metal, steel reinforcement, plastics, wood, cardboard,\nconduits and pipes, and electrical cabling are separated and stored on-site in skip bins separately\nallocated for each type and also stored in general skip bins for off-site separation and recycling at a\nlicensed recycling facility. Packaging materials including wood, plastics, and cardboard are returned to\nsuppliers for reuse as much as feasible. Materials containing asbestos are stored in bunded and\nappropriately contained facilities, sampled and tested for contaminants before being reused on-site or\ntransported off-site.\nConstruction projects generate a considerable amount of LW from several trades during the\nconstruction stage. The main sources of LW identified in this project include tunnel construction, dust\nsuppression, washouts, cleaning and cooling of vehicles and machinery and stormwater runoff from\nconstruction ancillary facilities. The processes followed to manage LW on-site are specified in the Soil\n7", "text_len": 4931, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Around 10-15% of LW including wastewater,\nstormwater, groundwater and tunnel inflow water generated during construction are treated and reused\non-site and the unused portions are discharged to comply with the environment protection licence (EPL).\nLiquid waste from washouts is stored in the sediment basin and discharged into the sewer as outlined in\nthe soil and surface water management sub-plan. Approval is required for discharging LW and it needs\nto comply with the EPL. The unused portion of LW such as paints, spill clean-up, pesticides, oil, fuel,\ngrease and other chemicals including the empty containers are returned to suppliers as much as possible.\nAt the site, the liquids are stored in appropriate containers in a bunded facility and transported for\ndisposal at a facility that lawfully accepts them. General solid waste (Non-putrescible) generated by site\noffices during construction is sorted and stored in bins and transported for off-site recycling based on\ntheir types and putrescible waste (food & domestic waste) is disposed of at a licensed landfill facility.\n4.3.2. Waste collection and transportation\nAfter the C&D waste is sorted and stockpiled/stored in dedicated skip bins/liquid waste containers, those\nare collected and transported for off-site reuse, recycling, treatment and disposal by the commissioned\nwaste contractor. The transporters from waste recycling facilities and/or disposal contractors (or the\nhaulage company) should hold the licence and permission to transport the waste type that is to be\ntransported from on-site. The transporter is responsible to know the type of waste and the permission\nrequirements of the location, to which the waste is transported for processing and/or disposal [17] and\nfulfilling the compliance required for transporting the waste, such as waste tracking applies for certain\ncategories of waste [18]. The waste generator, the owner of the waste, is also accountable for checking\nthe license of the recycling facility and landfill site to confirm the receiver sites can lawfully accept the\nwaste before the waste is removed from on-site. Every spoils haulage vehicle is attached with Global\nPositioning System (GPS) based tracking system, essentially a mobile phone type of device to check\nand confirm that the waste is transported and tipped at the approved destination in real-time. Such type\nof system facilitates the automation of waste data reporting by generating real-time electronic disposal\ndockets. In particular, it minimises the risk of forgeries of dockets and illegal dumping of waste.\n4.3.3. Waste reuse off-site\nReusing spoil off-sites for earthworks and engineering fill that complies with spoil exemption\nrequirements was found to be one of the main processes involved in WM. Clean spoil, in particular,\nsandstone has been effectively reused in other approved projects/land outside the project. Further,\ncertain types of C&D waste are transported and reused off-site wherever possible, while complying with\nexemptions for reusing each waste type. According to Ratnasabapathy et al. [19], waste trading is a\n‘process of buying and selling (or exchanging) reusable raw inert construction waste, recycled\nmaterials, products that contain recycled contents and energy recovered from C&D waste and/or\nservices between people, organizations, interstates, or countries’. As such, reuse of waste off-site can\nbe considered as exchanging/trading of waste across the projects. The waste materials that have been\nrecycled and remanufactured by the specialised facilities are also reused in new construction and\nmaintenance projects. Returning packing materials/empty containers to suppliers was found to be\nanother form of reusing waste materials in the C&D sector.\n4.3.4. Waste recycling/reprocessing\nRecycling of waste at the recycling facility involves several processes such as collection, further sorting,\nstockpiling of unprocessed waste, recycling and conversion of waste materials into raw materials that\ncan be used in the manufacturing of new products [1]. Recycling also involves the reprocessing of a\nproduct into new materials. While remanufacturing involves the processes of recovering, disassembling,\nrepairing and sanitizing components for resale as a “new product” to comply with required performance,\nquality and specifications. C&D waste that is commonly subject to recycling/reprocessing included\n8", "text_len": 4593, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Waste treatment and disposal\nWaste disposal is the last and least preferred process of WM. Any type of C&D waste and excess spoil\nthat cannot be reused either on-site/off-site, recycled or reprocessed are disposed of at a landfill site or\nspoil management sites, meeting the legal requirements based on their classification. C&D waste such\nas asbestos including asbestos-contaminated materials, special waste, and LW are subject to required\ntreatment before disposal and inert non-hazardous C&D waste (such as concrete, bricks, timber, steel,\netc.), and general solid waste from the site offices are disposed of lawfully. The landfill operators are\nrequired to cover the asbestos waste with VENM unless they have approval from the EPA to use an\nalternative cover [20]. The landfills which receive and accept the waste for disposal should have\nplanning approval and may require an EPL for the waste type that is to be disposed of/treated at a\nparticular landfill site/treatment facility [18].\n4.4. Sustainable practices implemented in waste management\nThe case study found that the infrastructure project team has committed to the efficient management of\nC&D waste and they highly focused on resource recovery through reuse and recycling from its\ncommencement. The project has achieved the set targets for landfill diversion for C&D waste and\nexceeded both construction waste and spoil diversion targets. The spoil diversion target has been\nsurpassed by 97% and it reflects the suboptimal performance against IS rating (40%- 60%). The\nmanagement of spoil generated by tunnelling work in highly urbanised environments is one of the major\nchallenges in most road and rail infrastructure projects in Australia [2]. However, the appointment of a\nspecial team, comprising of a Project manager and Engineers (some of them are experts in contaminated\nland management) on a full-time basis, has led to achieving a higher rate of landfill diversion of spoil\ngenerated in this project. The team considered several factors, such as the logistics of spoil movement\nincluding impacts on traffic, approval for off-site reuse, and economic and environmental benefits in\ndetermining the suitable options for spoil management. The spoil (uncontaminated spoil combining\nVENM and ENM) has been effectively reused on-site (within the project) as well as at the various off-\nsites that have received the approval for reuse of spoil for civil works. In particular, the sandstone\nextracted from tunnelling sites has been reused in two mega infrastructure projects, offering\nenvironmental and economic benefits while helping to progress both projects efficiently [21].\nBesides, annual waste audits were carried out for implementing effective spoil management\nstrategies and those audits were used as a benchmark to control spoil waste. It has been estimated that\naround 4.5 million tonnes of recycled aggregate sandstone will be used over the lifespan of the project.\nReusing waste generated by a project in another project/site through a trading process enables cost-\nsaving for both waste generators and consumers (the receiver site) as it reduces the cost of raw materials,\ntransport, and disposal [19]. The target rate for construction waste exceeded 90% through the reuse of\nwaste on-site as well as off-site to fit the purpose as much as practicable and recycling off-site. The\ninterviewee from the construction organisation stated that they are also considering the use of recycled\nmaterials such as crushed glass waste and recycled polypropylene fibre in concrete. As such, the\nconstruction organisations have committed to ensure that the project meets the infrastructure\nsustainability outcomes at a high level while accommodating the requirements of urban society and\nenhancing the conditions of the environment and economy. Ultimately, this project has established a\nleading example for delivering ecological infrastructure outcomes.\n5. Conclusions\nThis case study has examined the WM process flow of the large road infrastructure project in Australia\nand provided insight into the various processes involved in the C&D WM.

It is important to note that\nthis study has considered LW generated during construction as one of the major categories of waste\nwhile a lack of studies found to address the management processes associated with LW in construction\nprojects [22]. The WM PFD not only provides a better understanding of WM processes and waste fates\nbut also highlights the sustainable WM practices followed to achieve higher landfill diversion rates in\nthe studied project. Mapping the WM processes together with the legal requirements associated with\neach process involved both on-site and off-site is an effective approach to compare the WM practices\nassociated with different types of C&D waste generated by construction projects. It would help to\nidentify both effective and ineffective WM practices used and make informed decisions in implementing\nefficient and sustainable practices. The diagram serves as an operational tool to assist the development\nof effective WMP for other projects of similar nature, thus helping to attain higher rates for landfill\ndiversion and minimise environmental impact. The outcome of this case study also led to the\ndevelopment of a generic WM PFD for the C&D stream as a follow-up study.\nThe investigation of the case study in the studied infrastructure project also demonstrated that the\nproject has achieved high environmental and economic sustainability outcomes and targets in terms of\nC&D WM, demonstrating more than 90% landfill diversion rates for both spoil and construction waste\ngenerated during the construction stage. The outcome also proves that infrastructure projects have a very\nhigh potential to maximise re-use of high-value waste, mostly spoil, concrete, asphalt and timber through\nwaste exchange or trading across the projects, helping those projects to progress well and gain economic\nand environmental benefits. Achieving more than 90% landfill diversion rate in the C&D waste stream\nwould drive a shift towards a circular construction industry and produce a more sustainable built\nenvironment. A key part of Victoria’s recycling plan is to divert more waste from landfills based on the\nRecycled first policy which enables the optimisation of the use of Victorian recycled and reused\nmaterials that meet existing standards and specifications in transport infrastructure projects [23].\nImplementing such plans to achieve a higher landfill diversion rate in the C&D waste stream,\nconsistently across the other states and territories would drive a major shift towards a circular economy,\nproviding direct economic benefits and paving a path to greener Australia in the near future.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would also like to thank the industry experts who participated in the case study interviews\nand validation of the process flow diagram.\nReferences\n[1] Pickin J, Wardle C, O’Farrell K, Nyunt P and Donovan S 2020 National Waste Report 2020\nAustralia: Department of Agriculture Water and the Environment\n[2] Butler R and Bradford G 2017 NorthConnex and Hornsby quarry spoil management case study\n16th Australasian Tunnelling Conference 2017: Challenging Underground Space: Bigger,\nBetter, More.
