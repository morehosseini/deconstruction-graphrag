The\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nCouncil believes this approach will support waste being processed as close to its points of generation as\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\npossible. A full description of the levy portability approach is available in Appendix A.\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nI) The role of the Australian Government in providing a coherent, efficient and environmentally\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nresponsible approach to solid waste management, including by facilitating a federal approach.\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nWaste and recycling enterprises are subject to regulation by both local and state level authorities,\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nalthough they are also subject to some Commonwealth regulations, such as the Basel Convention.6\n​​​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nThese regulations vary enormously across jurisdictions, and this variation produces no economic,\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nenvironmental or social benefit. This variation is also adding substantial business costs to the sector.\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nThe Council supports the establishment of a simple, integrated national system for the identification,\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nclassification, treatment, disposal and monitoring of waste materials.\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nWhile there are many priorities for harmonisation, landfill levies create the most significant market\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\ndistortions. Landfill levies not only vary in price, but also in the mechanism7 by which they are applied,\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nalong with the definition of “leviable waste”.8\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nIn addition to landfill levies, a key barrier to a circular economy are the regulatory hurdles impeding the\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nestablishment of new waste and recycling facilities. These include planning regulations, development\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\napplications, EIS and licensing rules.\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nThese barriers can be overcome by the introduction of simpler and faster regulatory hurdles that do not\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\ncompromise safety or environmental standards. Further, the Council calls for improved state planning for\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nwaste management and recycling infrastructure. This planning will simplify and fast track development\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nprocesses. Harmonisation of national landfill and recycling standards can be achieved through agreement\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nat the Council of Australian Governments (COAG).\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nJ) Any other related matters.\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nJ1) Policy Roadmap\n​​ ​​\nThe NWRIC has published the ‘Policy Roadmap for a Circular Economy’. This document describes\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nregulatory action which efficiently will move Australia towards a circular economy.\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nJ2) PFOS/PFAS\n​​\nThe Council notes the Victorian EPA is leading the national effort to develop a standard for the treatment\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nand disposal of PFOS/PFAS. In regard to developing a new national standard, we would like to note the\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nfollowing;\n6 The Basel Convention\n​​​ ​​ ​​\n7 For example, NSW has recently introduced laws to make all waste management facilities liable for the levies, including MRFs and\ntr\n​\na\n​\nns\n​\nf\n​\ner station\n​\ns\n​\n.

The\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nCouncil believes this approach will support waste being processed as close to its points of generation as\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\npossible. A full description of the levy portability approach is available in Appendix A.\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nI) The role of the Australian Government in providing a coherent, efficient and environmentally\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nresponsible approach to solid waste management, including by facilitating a federal approach.\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nWaste and recycling enterprises are subject to regulation by both local and state level authorities,\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nalthough they are also subject to some Commonwealth regulations, such as the Basel Convention.6\n​​​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nThese regulations vary enormously across jurisdictions, and this variation produces no economic,\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nenvironmental or social benefit. This variation is also adding substantial business costs to the sector.\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nThe Council supports the establishment of a simple, integrated national system for the identification,\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nclassification, treatment, disposal and monitoring of waste materials.\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nWhile there are many priorities for harmonisation, landfill levies create the most significant market\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\ndistortions. Landfill levies not only vary in price, but also in the mechanism7 by which they are applied,\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nalong with the definition of “leviable waste”.8\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nIn addition to landfill levies, a key barrier to a circular economy are the regulatory hurdles impeding the\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nestablishment of new waste and recycling facilities. These include planning regulations, development\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\napplications, EIS and licensing rules.\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nThese barriers can be overcome by the introduction of simpler and faster regulatory hurdles that do not\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\ncompromise safety or environmental standards. Further, the Council calls for improved state planning for\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nwaste management and recycling infrastructure. This planning will simplify and fast track development\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nprocesses. Harmonisation of national landfill and recycling standards can be achieved through agreement\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nat the Council of Australian Governments (COAG).\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nJ) Any other related matters.\n​​ ​​ ​​ ​​\nJ1) Policy Roadmap\n​​ ​​\nThe NWRIC has published the ‘Policy Roadmap for a Circular Economy’.
