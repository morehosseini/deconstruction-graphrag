It uses a consistent method of measurement to assess how well buildings separate\nand divert waste generated on-site into streams that can be readily recovered, and whether\nthose materials are likely to go to a facility that will recover them efficiently. A NABERS Waste\nRating uses the same rigorous process to evaluate a building’s performance and then expresses\nit on a star rating scale according to an industry benchmark. This lets you see how your\n\nbuilding compares to its peers of a similar building type.\n\nThe NABERS Waste Rules set out the requirements to assess the waste management and\n\nresource recovery performance of any building type.\n\nNABERS Waste Ratings or Verifications must be performed by a NABERS Assessor accredited\nin the NABERS Waste methodology and comply with the principles and standards set in the\n\nrules for gathering, interpreting, and using waste data.\n\f", "text_len": 1289, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Its primary purpose is to facilitate the NABERS Waste Rating and\n\nVerification process by securely storing the necessary information.\n\nAdditionally, it functions independently as a valuable tool for tracking waste and recycling.\nThe Platform offers the ability to gain valuable insights into waste management practices,\n\npresenting dynamic charts and high-level indicators for a comprehensive overview.\n\nThe Platform can used across most of the built environment. Almost all property types are\nalready available and we will add additional as the demand increases. All user support\ndocuments for the Platform can be found on this page. This includes the current version of the\n\ndata upload template for the Platform.\n\nThe free training module, NABERS Waste Basics provides an introduction to the NABERS\nWaste Rating methodology and online platform for customers and users. We recommend for\nusers to upload their waste data on a regular basis to track, visualise and examine their ongoing\n\nwaste performance.\n\nWho can use the Waste Platform?\n\nAnyone with a valid NABERS login and password can use the Waste Platform.\n\nIf you are new to the Platform, then we recommend you complete our free online training.\n\f", "text_len": 1883, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "46.NABERS Waste Rules and support documentation.pdf", "page_num": 4, "text": "Why our data format?\n\nNABERS worked with the commercial property sector to develop a national standard waste\nreporting format. These reports allow waste producers to become more consistent across the\n\nsector which makes it easier to benchmark waste performance improvements.\n\nThis format is becoming a national standard for the collection of commercial waste data. The\n\nformat:\n\ne meets the needs of the Better Buildings Partnerships Operational Waste Guidelines;\ne can be used for Green Star points through the Green Building Council of Australia; and\n\ne aligns with the waste industry’s move towards actual-weight-based reporting\n\nBy delivering waste data in this format, you will be offering your clients best practice reporting.\n\nUsing the online Waste Platform\n\nThe Waste Platform can be configured to enable an organisation’s cleaning or waste contractor\nto upload their nightly collection data on a regular basis, using the Waste Platform Data\n\nTemplate below.\nAn organisation can also assign a Platform Administrator to carry out this task themselves.\n\nAlternately, they can find an assessor to manage the entire process on their behalf. There are\nnumerous specialised waste consultants among our list of accredited assessors who can provide\n\nthis assistance.\n\nThe organisation can view and use this data for ongoing management of their operational waste\n\nperformance, and to generate a NABERS Waste Rating or Verification.\n\nNABERS offers a free online tutorial on how to use the platform, called NABERS Waste Basics.\n\nThis training will give you:\n\ne an overall understanding of how the Platform works;\ne detail on how to upload data to the Platform;\n\ne an understanding of how organisations will view and use the data; and\n\f", "text_len": 1733, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
