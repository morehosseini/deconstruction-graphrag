Since the waste levy increase, typically the C&I and MSW\nwaste streams combined have accounted for about 80 per cent of\nwaste disposal, with the remaining 20 per cent from the C&D waste\nstream (Figure 6 and Table 4).\nWaste disposal sometimes includes waste used in beneficial ways\nat landfills, such as using crushed C&D waste in the construction of\ninternal roads in a landfill. Although this waste is ultimately subsumed by\nthe landfill, it avoids the use of virgin, excavated materials. In 2022–23,\nat least 80,000 tonnes of waste included in the disposal tonnes above\nwas used for a beneficial purpose at a landfill.\nThe department collects limited information about the material\ncomposition of waste disposal. In 2022–23, liable landfills reported that\n68 per cent of waste received at their facilities was ‘mixed putrescible\nwaste’, 19 per cent was C&D waste types, 3 per cent contaminated\nsoils, and the remainder other waste types. 40%\nThe waste strategy protect target is for no more than 15 per cent of 30%\nthe Perth and Peel regions’ waste to be disposed to landfill by 2030.
