The issue of\nfragmentation is characteristic of the construction industries in these two countries, and beyond. This\nstudy then develops a self recruiting-subletting cost indifference point model to explain why fragmentation\noccurs. Although the high proportion of small firms in the construction industry has been criticised as it\nprevents the exploitation of economies of scale, the self recruiting-subletting cost indifference point\nmodel theoretically proposes that subletting is usually profitable for construction firms. Thus the size\ndistribution of the construction industry has a propensity to skew towards small firms.\nKey words\nConstruction, industry size, industry structure, international comparison, cost indifference point\nINTRODUCTION\nThe construction industry makes a significant contribution to the economic and social welfare\nof a country. This is observed not only in the UK (CFR, 2003; Ive, 2004), but also in other\ncountries (Ofori, 1990; Low and Chan, 1997; Shen, et al., 2002; Ding, 2005). While describing\nmainly UK construction, the Pearce Report (2003) brings together in one place the key facts\nand data for the industry. Nigel Griffiths, the Minister of Construction in the UK, comments\nthat the Pearce Report (2003) provides an excellent basis for both a better understanding of\nthe industry and opportunities for future collaboration between the construction industry and\nits UK clients (p.i). As such, to put the main focus of that report - namely the UK - in a wider\ncontext, international comparisons between the construction industries of other countries are\nwarranted.\nThe UK construction industry has been the subject of a number of reviews in recent years,\nnotably including Latham (1994) and Egan (1998; 2002). The Centre for Constructing\nExcellence is an attempt to improve construction productivity and practice in the UK and\narose following the emerging industry reform agenda. Its objectives are to improve performance\nthrough increased productivity and competitiveness, improve industry image by taking action\nto create a step change in culture, in the development of people, and enhance engagement\nwith the community and the industry’s customers, and to more generally engage and take\naction with individuals, businesses, organisations and industry associations (http://www.\n5102\nyraunaJ\n10\n30:20\nta\n]ytisrevinU\nnretsaehtroN[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nA comparative study of construction industry size and structure between\nThe Internationathl eJ oUuKrn aanl do fA Cusotnrsatlriuac atinodn tMhea sniaggneifmiceanntc (e2 0o0f 6in)d 3u9s t-r y5 5fragmentation | \n | tween\ntion", "text_len": 3501, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The Pearce Report (Pearce, 2003) is the latest review of the\nUK construction industry, and in particular Chapter 3 focuses on definitions and measures\nused as the basis for the comparison in this paper.\nBeginning with the report Strategies for the Reduction of Claims and Disputes in the\nConstruction Industry (AFCC, 1988), the Australian building and construction industry was\nthe subject of a number of significant studies such as the Industry Commission (1991) reports,\nand two Royal Commissions. Other reports by the then Department of Industry, Technology\nand Commerce revealed the state of the Australian building and construction industry’s costs,\nefficiency, competitiveness and productivity. Problem factors in Australia, such as claims and\ndisputes, were compared with similar problems overseas. Through productivity and\nperformance studies a comprehensive snapshot emerged of the difficult situation the industry\nfaced in the late 1980s. The findings revealed limitations within the industry that were self-\nimposed as well as problems that were a world-wide phenomenon of the time. The surveys\nclearly established not just the need but also the agenda for reform in the Australian building\nconstruction industry. The publication of No Disputes (NPWC, 1990) consolidated the reform\nagenda, and the subsequent process of reform, organisational and cultural change was led by\nthe New South Wales and Commonwealth governments. In particular, The Royal Commission\ninto the Building and Construction Industry (http://www.royalcombci.gov.au) amassed vast\namounts of information on practices and performance of the Australian industry.\nThis paper aims to compare the UK and Australian construction industries by further examining\nthe two definitions for the construction industry proposed in the Pearce Report (2003) and\nusing the latest published data from both countries. It then develops a self recruiting-subletting\ncost indifference point model to explain the effect of fragmentation, as a significant\ncharacteristic arising from the comparison is that both countries are dominated by the proportion\nof small firms. The paper logically consists of five sections. Section 1 is the introduction.\nSection 2 brings out the implications of using either broad or narrow definitions of the\nconstruction industry - nationally and internationally. Section 3 analyses different indicators\nfor measuring the size of the construction industry and how these might be interpreted. Section\n4 looks at industry structure, and develops a self recruiting-subletting cost indifference point\nmodel to explain composition characteristics. Section 5 concludes the study.\nTHE IMPLICATIONS OF USING BROAD OR NARROW DEFINITIONS FOR\nCONSTRUCTION\nThis study is based on the similar podium created by Pearce (2003). He proposed two definitions\nfor the construction industry, one narrow and one broad. The narrow sector is defined as “...\nthose who construct, repair and maintain buildings or engineering works in situ ... including\nsite preparation, construction of buildings and civil engineering works, building installation\n(e.g. electrical wiring, plumbing), building completion (e.g. painting, plastering) and renting\nof construction or demolition equipment supplied with an operator” (Pearce, 2003, p.9). The\nbroad sector includes not only those who are already in the “narrow” sector, but also “those\nwho quarry raw materials, plus those who manufacture and sell the materials, products and\nassemblies used by contractors, plus those who supply professional management, design,\nengineering and surveying services to the industry or its clients, plus construction and repair\nworks undertaken by households and other non-contracting organizations” (Pearce, 2003,\np.9). Pearce (2003) suggests that the broad sector that includes the supply chain for construction\n5102\nyraunaJ\n10\n30:20\nta\n]ytisrevinU\nnretsaehtroN[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD", "text_len": 3963, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

(2004) suggest that all international comparisons have to be\ntreated with caution because of the reliability and comparability of data. Sawhney et al. (2004),\nalso stress that the concept of comparability and representativity form the crux of international\ncomparison. Hence, it seems that the key issue for adopting either the broad or the narrow\ndefinition is whether Pearce’s definition is comparable with Australia’s, and the availability\nand reliability of data.\nPearce’s broad definition is sensible. Indeed, Pearce has drawn a reasonable boundary for his\nbroad definition. However, based on the authors’ knowledge, the Australian Bureau of Statistics\n(ABS) does not publish single-source data for Australian construction industry that is\ncomparable with the broad sector proposed by Pearce. The Pearce Report also suggests that\nthere is no single-source data for the broad sector of the UK construction industry either.\nHence, it appears that it is impossible to find single-source data for the broad sector to compare\nthe two industries.\nEven though data for individual members of the broad sector can be assembled from various\nsources; still it is uncertain as to how accurate and reliable such aggregated data is. This is\ndemonstrated by the data for the output of the UK broad sector. In the Pearce Report, the data\nfor contractor’s output were from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Housing and\nConstruction Statistics 2002 reported in DLC (2002). The data for construction materials and\nproducts, wholesale and retail trade were from Annual Business Inquiry (ABI) 2003 reported\nin ONS (2003). The data for construction professional services were from Construction Industry\nCouncil (CIC) Professional Service Survey 2002 reported in DLC (2002). The data for self-\nbuilt activities were from Davis Langdon and Everest (2000). The data for direct labour were\nfrom both DTI Housing and Construction Statistics 2002 reported in DLC (2002) and CFR\n(2003). The data for the black economy were compiled from various sources. Because of the\ndifferent sources and methods used for the various collections the resulting statistics are not\nalways compatible with each other. Actually, the output of the informal construction for either\nthe UK or other countries can be estimates only.\nEven if data for each member of the broad sector, which is from various sources, is reasonably\naccurate and reliable, still the accuracy and reliability of the overall gross output of the broad\nsector, which is the aggregated data, is questionable. This is because there could be overlaps\namong members of the broad sector and the extent of the overlap has to be clearly stipulated.\nHowever, Pearce (2003) suggests that the output of self-built and informal construction is\nvery difficult to estimate and that the extent of overlap between the members of the UK broad\nsector is unknown. Indeed, the overlap between informal construction and wholesale and\nretail can never be known either in the UK or Australia. Hence, comparisons between the UK\nand Australia construction industries cannot be based on the broad definition proposed by the\nPearce Report.\n5102\nyraunaJ\n10\n30:20\nta\n]ytisrevinU\nnretsaehtroN[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD", "text_len": 3993, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "90.Case study of demolition costs of residential buildings.pdf", "page_num": 6, "text": "42 Langston and Wu\nThe currently available data for the output of the construction industry in Australia published\nby ABS are for “residential buildings (house, flats, etc.), non-residential buildings (office,\nshops, hotels, etc.), and engineering constructions (roads, bridges, water and sewage, etc.)”\n(ABS, 2005, p.571). These three areas of activities fall approximately in the category of the\nnarrow definition proposed by the Pearce Report. In addition, accurate and reliable data for\nthe narrow sector is available in DTI statistics for the UK and in ABS publications for the\nAustralia respectively. Therefore, based on the comparability of the concept, and the availability\nand reliability of data, it is the “narrow” rather than the “broad” definition that is adopted in\nthis study. It may be argued that it may not be appropriate to exclude professional services in\nthe UK when comparisons are being made with a country where “design and build” (DB)\npredominates. However, it should be noted that the DB procurement method is also widely\nadopted in the UK construction industry, rising from 35.7 per cent in 1993 to 42.7 per cent in\n2001 by value of contract (RICS, 2001). In addition, there are no official statistics available\nrelating to the percentage of this procurement method being used in Australian non-residential\nbuildings and engineering constructions, although it is the main procurement method for\nAustralian housing constructions (Georgiou, 2000). Indeed, the UK construction industry will\nbe understated to some extent when the narrow definition is adopted, provided that the\npercentage of DB projects in Australia by value of contract is higher than that in the UK. This\nissue is further discussed later in this paper.\nIn short, a broad definition may be adopted for studies at a national level, such as a longitudinal\nstudy conducted to track the performance of the construction industry over time. But due to\nthe reliability and comparability of available data, comparisons between the construction\nindustry in the UK and Australia need to focus on the narrow sector. Indeed, the approach of\nthe Ive et al. (2004) study, whose research objective was to compare the productivity in the\nUK, France, Germany and the USA, was also to use the narrow sector definition.\nA COMPARISON OF CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SIZE\nDue to problems of definition, measuring the size of the construction industry is not\nstraightforward. Nevertheless, the size of the industry may still be measured using a number\nof potential indicators. Foremost among these indicators are 1) employment; 2) number of\nfirms; 3) cement consumption; 4) housing completion in m2 built area; 5) brick consumption;\n6) gross output; and 7) value-added (Meikle and Hillebrandt, 1988; RCBCI, 2002a; 2005b;\nPearce, 2003; Meikle and Grilli, 2005). While other indicators exist and have been used, the\nones listed above appear to be the most common.\nEmployment and number of firms are indicators of the size of the labour force in a construction\nindustry. Employment is chosen in this study simply because the ABS does not publish yearly\ndata for the total number of Australian construction firms. There have been only four\nConstruction Industry Surveys (CIS) conducted by the ABS, at intervals of approximately\nfive years. Even the most recent survey was for 1996-97 (de Valence, 1999a; Croce, 1999;\nRCBCI, 2002a; ABS, 1991-2005). Furthermore, the size and distribution of the number of\nfirms in the UK and Australian construction industries are not consistent (RCBCI, 2002a;\nPearce, 2003). As such, a larger number of firms does not guarantee a bigger workforce.\nHence, employment, rather than number of construction firms, is adopted in this study. At\nleast this makes a comparison possible.\n5102\nyraunaJ\n10\n30:20\nta\n]ytisrevinU\nnretsaehtroN[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD", "text_len": 3834, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "90.Case study of demolition costs of residential buildings.pdf", "page_num": 7, "text": "A comparative study of construction industry size and structure between\nthe UK and Australia and the significance of industry fragmentation 43\nIn the UK, there exist at least two distinct sets of statistics for measuring the size of the\nconstruction workforce. One is an employer-based survey undertaken by the Department of\nTrade and Industry (DTI). The other is an employee-based survey known as the Labour Force\nSurvey (LFS) (Ive et al., 2004; Briscoe, 2004). Following the approach used in the Pearce\nReport, this study uses the DTI estimates to measure the workforce of the UK construction\nindustry. The accuracy of the alternative LFS estimate is questionable as its sample size is\nonly about 0.3 per cent of its population (Ive et al., 2004). Nevertheless, it should be borne in\nmind that the labour force of the UK construction industry is understated by using the DTI\ndata, as “employment” in the UK means workers employed. This is not the same as the total\nworkforce, since the incidence of self-employment in the UK is high (Briscoe, 2004).\nMeikle and Grilli (2005) suggest that cement consumption, housing completion and brick\nconsumption are physical measures, indirectly giving an indication of the volume of\nconstruction output. Among these physical measures, it seems that cement is the most reliable.\nData on housing completions in m2 built area cannot be considered a reliable indicator of the\ntotal amount of construction work, as it gives an indication of only one sector of construction\n- residential building - and is usually adjusted to value measures using dubious conversion\nfactors. Brick consumption is not a reliable indictor either for two reasons. First, building\ntechnology across countries is substantially different. Second, brick consumption data is usually\nfrom brick production and import/export records. However, the ability to stockpile bricks is\nindeterminate (Meikle and Grilli, 2005). Cement has a short shelf life, usually about two\nmonths (Wu and Low, 2005a), and is usually manufactured on a large-scale with well-\nmaintained production data (Meikle and Grilli, 2005). Data are also readily available in imports\nand exports (Low and Tan, 1993). Cement is also a basic building material (Wu and Low,\n2005a; 2005b), and its annual consumption figures can be calculated with reasonable\nconfidence. Therefore, it seems that cement consumption is a more reliable indicator than\nhousing completion and brick consumption. Nevertheless, it may be argued that some countries\n(for example France) may use highly cement-intensive construction technologies (World Bank,\n1992). However, it appears that this has not been recorded either in the UK or Australia.\nThe gross output and value-added can directly measure the value of construction output. Since\ngross domestic product (GDP) is the sum of all value-adding activities across all sectors in the\neconomy, it seems that the value-added figure for construction is the more relevant measure\nas it indicates the contribution that the sector makes to GDP (Pearce, 2003).\nThe above brief analysis suggests that employment, cement consumption and value-added, in\ntheory, should provide a more accurate estimate of construction industry size. Hence, the\ncomparison of the construction industries in the UK and Australia is approached through the\ndiscussion of employment, cement consumption and value-added indicators.\nEmployment\nTable 1 shows employment trends for contractors in the UK and Australia respectively. The\ndata for employment in the Australian construction industry are compiled from the Year Book\nof Australia (versions 1991 to 2002). The data are for May or June each year.

Table 1 shows that the\nindustry in the UK lost 241,000 jobs between 1991 and 1996. However, since 1996, employment\nin the construction industry in the UK recovered steadily, rising to 1,567,000 in 2001, albeit\nstill 3.6 per cent less than that in 1991. de Valence (1999b) suggests that Australia had\nexperienced a major building boom in the late 1980s. Barda (1995) suggests that whilst a\nlooming recession was approaching, the beginning of the devastation of the commercial\nproperty markets (non-residential building) in 1990 ironically provided an opportunity to\nreverse the slide. The statistics provided by ABS (1991-2005) suggests that since 1996, the\nsum of the volumes of activity in residential and engineering construction, driven by the\nprivate sector (see Figure 1), had grown steadily, probably by over 40 per cent (see Figure 2).\nIt is largely for this reason that employment in Australia rose by about 13 per cent from 1991\nto 1996, with an additional 20 per cent added from 1996 to 2001 (see Table 1).\nSource: ABS Official Year Book of Australia (2003)\nFigure 1 Total construction activity in Australia, values of work done by type or sector\nFigure 1 shows that construction activity for the public sector in Australia remained relatively\nconstant at around A$15,000 million annually from 1991 to 2001.

Chain volume\n(constant dollars) measures show changes in value after the direct effects of price changes\nhave been eliminated. Figure 1 also shows that the growth in the value of total construction\noutput from 1992 to 2000 was driven by private sector activity. ABS (2003) suggests that the\ngrowth in Australian private construction activity resulted from government deregulation.\n5102\nyraunaJ\n10\n30:20\nta\n]ytisrevinU\nnretsaehtroN[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD", "text_len": 2678, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

However, the growth of the private construction\nsector in the UK was the result of privatisation of public utilities and the classification of\nPrivate Finance Initiative and Private Public Partnership projects as private sector output\n(Pearce, 2003).\nSource: ABS Official Year Book of Australia (2003)\nFigure 2 Total construction activity in Australia, values of work done by type of activity(A$ million)\nFigure 2 shows the value of work done by non-residential construction activities and the sum\nof work done by residential and engineering construction activities in the Australian construction\nindustry respectively.

However, the Pearce Report\nsuggests that the recovery of the UK construction industry was not because of its housing\nconstruction activities, as housing output remained constant for the same period in the UK.\nIn summary, Table 1 shows that while employment in the UK construction industry was\ncyclically recovering and reached 96.4 per cent of its 1991 record by 2001, employment in the\nAustralian construction industry was expanding cyclically and experienced about a 36 per\ncent increase in the same period of time. The Construction Industry Training Board reported\nthat 64,000 people were leaving the UK construction industry each year (CITB, 2000). Hence,\nmore people had to be employed simply to replace those who left the industry. Despite the\nrecent increase of jobs from 1999 to 2001 in the UK, its National Audit Office suggested that,\nprobably because of its poor image, the UK construction industry had difficulty in recruiting,\nparticularly talented people (NAO, 2001). The introduction of the new tax system in July\n2000 in Australia was a significant factor behind employment in the construction industry of\nthat year being substantially lower than in 1999, reversing the growth of the proceeding four\nyears.

As such,\ninternational comparisons of the value-added contributions of construction industries have to\nconvert national currencies to a common base (Walsh et al., 2005). Monetary exchange rates\nand the purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates can be adopted to compare the\nconstruction costs internationally (Langston and de Valence, 1999; Walsh et al., 2005). PPP is\nthe amount of currency in a given country required to purchase a basket of goods and services\ndivided by the amount of currency in another country required to purchase the same basket\n(Walsh et al., 2005). PPP can therefore be understood as a means for inter-spatial comparison\nof prices and is generally regarded as superior to using monetary exchange rates (Langston\nand de Valence, 1999; Langston and Best, 2000; 2001; 2005; Sawhney et al., 2004).\nThe reliability of the monetary exchange rate approach is questionable, as exchange rates are\nbased on short-term factors and are subject to substantial distortions from speculative\nmovements and government interventions, even when exchange rates are averaged over a\nperiod of time. The problems associated with adopting exchange rates for international\ncomparisons have been recognised for many years (e.g. Cassel, 1916).\nThe monetary exchange rate approach for the comparison of value-added contributions between\nthe UK and Australian construction industries for the period 1993 to 2001 is shown in Table 3.\nValue-added data for the UK construction industry are taken from ONS (2002). Value-added\ndata for the Australian construction industry was compiled from the ABS Year Book of Australia\n(issues 1993 to 2003).

The years in Table 3\nrefer to calendar years. Value-added figures for the Australian construction industry are at\n2003 prices. Note that the output of the Australian construction industry in Table 3 is in value-\nadded terms, whilst the outputs shown earlier in Figures 1 and 2 are gross output.

Comparing the mean for the ratio of the\nUK construction industry value added to the Australian construction industry value-added\nderived by the OECD PPP approach (µ in Table 4) and that derived by the monetary approach\nRO\n( µ in Table 3), it can be shown that the UK construction industry is overstated by about\nRM\n11.7 per cent (i.e. ((2.96-2.65)/2.65)x100%=11.7%) by the latter approach. If using an ICP\nPPP approach, this would be even more pronounced at 23.3 per cent (i.e. ((2.96-2.4)/2.4)\nx100%=23.3%). Hence, a monetary exchange rate approach is biased in favour of the UK, a\nmore developed country.\nA simple calculation of PPP-adjusted value-added per person employed in the industry shows\nan interesting result. For the period 1993 to 2001 in the UK, the average per capita output\n(labour productivity) was $49,050 with a 2.54% co-efficient of variation. In Australia for the\nsame period, the value-added per person employed was $42,250 with a 9.87% co-efficient of\nvariation. In each year except 1993, the UK outperformed Australia with an average increase\nover the period of 16.1%. Using monetary exchange rates instead of PPP, this would be even\nmore pronounced. This result confirms earlier research by Langston and de Valence (1999)\nthat ranks the UK ahead of Australia based on standard building projects priced in each country.\nDiscussion\nThe ratio of the UK construction industry size to its Australian counterpart, as shown in\nTables 1 to 4, are not the same. This is to be expected, as although labour, cement consumption\nand value-added are widely adopted indicators for measuring the construction industry size,\nnone of them are perfect. Briscoe (2004) suggests that a substantial number of construction\nworkers undertake work on an informal basis and therefore their employment may not be\nrecorded. Figures for exports and imports of cement may not be reliable. Value-added can\nbe no more than an estimated figure (Meikle and Grilli, 2005). However, while bearing in\nmind the “errors” there could be, for example, in the data for output and employment and\nthe accuracy of the PPPs, the ratios in Table 1 to 4 are actually remarkably similar. This\nsuggests that the proposition made in this study to use the narrow definition for international\ncomparisons is acceptable.\nNevertheless, it has been argued that the UK workforce is understated when measured by DTI\ndata (Briscoe, 2004). The actual ratio of labour force in the UK construction industry to the\nAustralian construction industry figure should be higher than the value for µ calculated in\nRE\nTable 1. Since the average labour productivity in the UK construction industry also outperforms\nthat in the Australia construction industry over the period 1991 to 2001, it can be concluded\nsafely that the UK construction industry is at least 2.39 times larger than the Australian\nconstruction industry over the same period.\nAssuming all the projects in Australia are “design and build” (DB) projects, professional\nservices in Australia have already been included into the output of Australian contractors.\nThis assumption is biased against Australia, as at least not all of its housing projects are DB\nprojects (Georgiou, 2000). Under such an assumption, to be fair to the UK construction industry,\nprofessional services in the UK also need to be incorporated in the output of UK contractors.\nDLC (2002) suggests that professional services in the UK contribute about 17 per cent of the\noutput of contractors. RICS (2001) suggests that the average value of DB projects in the UK\nis about 38 per cent by value of all contracts over the period 1993 to 2001. Hence, the mean\nfor the OECD PPP approach ratio of the UK construction industry value-added to the Australian\n5102\nyraunaJ\n10\n30:20\nta\n]ytisrevinU\nnretsaehtroN[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD", "text_len": 3961, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

To understand the structure of the Australian construction industry,\nABS conducted four nation-wide surveys. As stated above, the fourth and most recent survey\nwas in 1996-97. All four surveys found that the Australian construction industry was\noverwhelmingly made up of small firms. Firms with more than 20 employees accounted for\nmerely one per cent of the total number of enterprises (RCBCI, 2002a). This is dramatically\nillustrated in Figure 3(a), where the shaded area represents the percentage of firms employing\n20 persons or more. CFR (2003) investigated the structure of the UK construction industry.\nBased on the CFR study, Pearce (2003) concluded that the vast majority of construction firms\nin the UK construction industry tended to be small, with only 10 per cent of all firms employing\n7 persons or more (see Figure 3(b)). Nevertheless, small firms in the UK and Australia\ncontributed most of the national construction output (RCBCI, 2002a; Pearce, 2003).\na. Percentage of firms with 20 employees or more b.

Fragmentation is certainly a key\ncharacteristic of the construction industries in both UK and Australia, and anecdotally elsewhere.\nYet Pearce’s conclusions are disputed, in the sense that the tendency for a large number of\nsmall firms driving construction industry output is not necessarily an undesirable condition\n5102\nyraunaJ\n10\n30:20\nta\n]ytisrevinU\nnretsaehtroN[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD", "text_len": 2961, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

A unique approach to conceptualising the\ndrivers that lead to construction industry fragmentation is discussed in the remainder of this\npaper, and the resulting model is used as a defence to the need for policy intervention.\nThe model developed here suggests that the size distribution of the construction industry must\nskew towards small firms. This section consists of two parts. First, a model is developed for a\nfirm to decide whether it should sublet a workload to a sub-contractor. Second, the model and\nits implications are discussed.\nA self recruiting-subletting cost indifference point model\nThe construction industry (whether UK or Australia) is dominated by small firms. This is\nmainly the result of subletting practices. In this section, a model is developed to help a firm to\ndecide whether it should sublet workload to a sub-contractor.\nA factory produces a manufacturing product, such as a desktop computer. A contractor builds\na construction product, for example, a hotel. Both the manufacture of a desktop computer and\nthe construction of a hotel involve many trades. A computer consists of a monitor, keyboard,\nhard disc, motherboard, floppy disk drive, DVD drive, speaker, case, power supply, etc. The\nmanufacture of the power supply can be further broken down to wiring, welding, etc. The\nconstruction of a hotel involves substructure, superstructure, finishing, fittings, services, etc.\nThe services can be further broken down to plant, pipe installation, electrical wiring, etc. To\ncomplete an approved task, for example, welding, a firm (which could be a manufacturer or a\ncontractor) can purchase its own facilities and hire its own employees to complete the task, or\nalternatively, can sublet the work to a sub-contractor.\nTo recruit its own people, the firm needs to pay a recruiting fee, k ($). The recruiting expenditure\nincludes an advertisement fee and interview expenditure, or else pay a fee to an employment\nagency. The recruiting fee is assumed to be fixed for each round, no matter how many people\nare recruited. The number of people recruited in each round is Q . The annual salary is P ($).\nself\nThe firm also needs to set up a workshop and purchase its own facilities, such as welding\nmachines, fire extinguishers, etc. The facilities are usually in proportion to the number of\npeople using the facility. To cut down its expenditure, when a task is completed, the firm\nreleases its workforce again. The firm recruits new people when a new task arises. The sum of\nthe workload of the tasks is D (man.year/annum). Although people may be released when a\ntask is complete, the firm has to keep all the facilities for the next task. The annual cost of\nkeeping the facilities and workshop per person is H ($). Alternatively, the firm may sublet its\nwork to a sub-contractor. In such a case, all the recruiting fees and facility fees are transferred\nto the sub-contractor, but charged back to the firm as a higher unit cost per annum P ($)\nsublet\n(i.e., P is greater than P ). It is assumed that k, Q, P , D, H and P are constant and\nsublet self self sublet\nD is predictable.\nPrevious studies (Wu, 2004; Wu and Low, 2005a; 2005b) suggest that the crux of the decision\nas to whether a firm should hire its own employees or sublet the workload to a sub-contractor\nis to identify the cost indifference point between the self recruiting system and the subletting\nsystem. The self recruiting-subletting cost indifference point is the amount of workload at\nwhich the total annual optimum cost under a self recruiting system equals the total annual cost\nunder a subletting system. Based on the conditions above, the total cost under the self recruiting\nsystem, TC is the sum of the recruiting costs, holding costs, and the salaries paid directly to\nself\nemployees, or:\n5102\nyraunaJ\n10\n30:20\nta\n]ytisrevinU\nnretsaehtroN[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD", "text_len": 3926, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

{"source_file": "90.Case study of demolition costs of residential buildings.pdf", "page_num": 16, "text": "52 Langston and Wu\nFigure 4 The self recruiting-subletting cost indifference point\nTwo rules can be summarised from Figure 4. Rule 1 is that when the self recruiting-subletting\ncost indifference point D is a constant, a firm with a low workload may sublet its workload\nindr\nto a sub-contractor and a firm with a high workload probably should purchase its own facility\nand recruit its own people to finish a task. Rule 2 is that when workload is a constant, any shift\nin the self recruiting-subletting cost indifference point D (see Eq. 9) to a higher value\nindr\nencourages subletting the workload to a sub-contractor.\nFigure 4 seems to suggest that whilst a self-recruiting system should be encouraged in the\nmanufacturing industry, subletting is probably a more economically viable alternative in the\nconstruction industry. The construction industry is project-oriented. The contractor has to\nshift to a new construction site for a new project. The frequent shifting incurs additional costs\nfor maintaining facilities thus increasing H in the self recruiting-subletting cost indifference\npoint model in Eq. 9, therefore shifting D to a higher value, forcing construction firms to\nindr\nskew towards a subletting system, even when workload remains constant. This is Rule 2.\nThe workload for a specific kind of person (such as a welder) for a project is usually low. The\nreasons are two-fold. Firstly, “one-off” designs are normal in the construction industry, as the\nfinal product of construction is usually of unique composition and is site specific (Low and\nChan, 1997). Hence, there is seldom a “standard” process in the construction industry. Secondly,\nthe construction industry is highly fragmented with different transient project consultants,\nbuilders and suppliers. Since the workload for a specific kind of tradesperson for a construction\nproject is low, based on Rule 1, subletting is again probably a more economic viable alternative\nfor a contractor.\nThe workload for each kind of tradesperson in the manufacturing industry is usually high, as\nthe situation in the manufacturing industry is conversely different from that in the construction\nindustry. In the manufacturing industry, standard designs and repetitive processes are strictly\nadhered to. The standard designs and repetitive production runs are usually adopted for a\nspecific period of time until the next change in design arises, usually a few years later to\naccommodate changes in marketing strategies (Low and Chan, 1997). According to Rule 1,\nand since it is possible for the workload for a specific kind of tradesperson in the manufacturing\nindustry to be higher than the self recruiting-subletting cost indifference point, a self recruiting\nsystem should be encouraged in the manufacturing industry.\nIn summary, the self recruiting-subletting cost indifference point model suggests that the\nconstruction industry should encourage subletting and the industry should skew towards small\nfirms. This is what the data shows. While it may be argued at a superficial level that the large\nnumber of small firms leads to a loss of potential economies of scale, when looked at more\nclosely, the nature of the construction industry, whether it be the UK, Australia or elsewhere,\n5102\nyraunaJ\n10\n30:20\nta\n]ytisrevinU\nnretsaehtroN[\nyb\ndedaolnwoD", "text_len": 3310, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Viewed in the context of\nspecialisation, quality and compliance, the case for fragmentation is even more convincing.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study compares the size and basic structure of the UK construction industry and the\nAustralian construction industry. This study finds that in terms of employment, cement\nconsumption, and the value-added contributions by the construction industry, the UK\nconstruction industry is about two-and-a-half times larger than that of the Australia construction\nindustry over the period between 1993 and 2001. In terms of value-added per person employed,\nthe UK industry is on average 16.1 per cent more effective than its Australian counterpart, at\nleast assuming all other factors (e.g. time to complete, quality of construction, client satisfaction,\netc.) are equal. It is found that both the UK and Australian construction industries are heavily\nskewed towards small firms. In this study a self recruiting-subletting cost indifference model\nhas been developed to provide insight into the reasons behind construction industry\nfragmentation. Whilst the overwhelming number of small firms can be criticised for preventing\nthe exploitation of economies of scale, the self recruiting-subletting cost indifference model\nsuggests that subletting is probably the most profitable practice for construction firms. It is\nnot surprising, therefore, that the structure of the construction industry is skewed toward a\nlarge number of very small firms.\nREFERENCES\nABS (1991-2005).
