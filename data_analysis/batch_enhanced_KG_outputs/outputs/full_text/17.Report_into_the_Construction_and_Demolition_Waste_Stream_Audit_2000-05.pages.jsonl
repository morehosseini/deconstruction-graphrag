The field\ncomponent was based upon a series of sampling techniques to enable the mixed C&D waste stream of interest to\nbe accurately and efficiently targeted.\nThe audit was undertaken in the Sydney Metropolitan Area (SMA) because:\n• 72% of C&D waste disposed of in NSW is disposed of in the SMA3\n• the nature of the landfilling industry in the SMA is different to that of the rest of NSW. In particular, the SMA\nhas more recycling and reprocessing facilities, whereas landfilling of C&D waste in the rest of NSW tends to\noccur as co-disposal with other types of waste\n• budget constraints.\nA-1 Preliminary Desktop Audit\nDisposal data of C&D waste to landfills in the SMA is collected through the Waste Contribution Monthly Reports\n(WCMR) submitted by landfills in association with payment of the waste levy required by Section 88 of the\nProtection of the Environment Operations Act, 1997.\nThe first stages in developing the field audit was to undertake a desktop analysis of the WCMRs. This analysis\nidentified quantities of material disposed of as segregated loads such as contaminated soil and asbestos and\nthe quantity of mixed C&D waste disposed (unsegregated loads). Knowing the quantities of segregated loads\ndisposed to landfill meant that there was no requirement to include these materials in the physical audit. This\nallowed the focus to be on identifying the composition of the mixed C&D waste.\nA-2 Field Composition Audit\nThe methodology used for the composition audit was developed to target the mixed waste component of the\nC&D waste stream as well as avoid the inherent inaccuracies associated with using visual-based assessment.\nThese inaccuracies appear to be particularly significant when using visual assessment methods to quantify fine\nmaterials in a mixed waste sample which are significant components of mixed C&D waste. Fine materials in a\nstockpile cannot be observed by visual-based assessment techniques so timber and large waste materials are\nover-estimated.\nA new auditing methodology based on measurement by weight was therefore developed. The methodology\nemployed sampling techniques based on particle size and source flow of mixed C&D waste materials. A summary\nof the methodology is provided below.\n3 Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery in NSW – A Progress Report, 2004\n22 Report into the Construction and Demolition Waste Stream", "text_len": 2831, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

All agreed to\nparticipate in the project once issues of safety and confidentiality had been addressed.\nThe five landfills selected for the mixed C&D waste audit accounted for:\n• 88% of the mixed C&D waste disposed to landfill in the SMA\n• 77% of all C&D waste disposed to landfill in the SMA.4\nA-2-2 Sampling Regime\nA-2-2-1 Source Flow Sub-Streams\nThe interviews with each landfill manager identified vehicle type as the predominant characteristic used to\ndetermine the flow source of mixed C&D waste on site. Using this method of classification, eleven distinct sub-\nstreams of C&D waste were identified. A stratified sampling plan was then developed based on the quantity of\nmixed C&D waste disposed within each waste flow sub-stream. This information was used to determine how many\nstockpiles were required for each identified sub-stream to ensure the collection of representative data.\nA-2-2-2 Gatehouse Activities\nRandom sampling was used to determine which of the vehicles delivering mixed C&D waste within each sub-\nstream to the landfill were diverted for stockpile construction. Stockpiles were used to ensure that the waste was\nwell mixed and representative of each waste sub-stream.\nA-2-2-3 Stockpile Construction\nStockpiles of C&D waste were constructed for each waste flow sub-stream. As a vehicle was identified as\nbelonging to a waste flow sub stream of interest it was directed to unload in a particular stockpile. Loads\ncontinued to be directed to stockpiles until the stockpile was 100m3.\nMechanical plant (front-end loaders, excavators, bobcats etc) were used to thoroughly mix the loads contributing\nto each stockpile, after each new load, and again once the stockpile had been completed.

A cross-section of material, down to the\nbase of the stockpile, was taken from each stockpile after it had been built and thoroughly mixed.\nA-2-2-5 Waste Sorting and Analysis\nAll stockpile samples (8-15m3) were sorted into size fractions through a combination of manual and mechanical\nsorting processes. The different particle-size fractions used in this analysis were as follows:\n• greater than 300mm (large)\n• 30mm to 300mm (medium)\n• 4.75mm to 30mm (small)\n• less than 4.75mm (fines).\nThe waste material classifications used in the sorting are detailed in Appendix B.\nManual sorting was initially used to separate the large-size fraction (>300mm ) from the sample and each\nindividual piece of material was recorded and measured. The material type, dimensions (height x length x width)\nand weight of each item were recorded.\nThe remaining sample was then loaded into the mechanical sorting plants (Photographs 2 and 3).\nPhotograph 2 – Doppelstadt trommel with picking belt, for manual sorting\nPhotograph 3 – Pitbull screening plant with picking belt, for manual sorting\n24 Report into the Construction and Demolition Waste Stream", "text_len": 1228, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The information gained was\nused to understand the sample errors associated with using a sample based audit strategy (see Appendix D for\nmore detail). Sample validation was undertaken for:\n• Sampling of Stockpiles\nThe sampling strategy required a single 8-15m3 sample to be selected from each 100m3 stockpile for\nmeasurement. To understand the variation of sample selection, one stockpile was selected and four 8-15m3\nsamples were taken. The compositional analysis of the four samples provided an indicator of the expected\nvariance associated with sample selection.\n• Material Classification of the Medium-size Fraction (30-300mm)\nThe medium-size fraction for one sample was sorted and re-mixed four times so that the accuracy of the\ncompositional analyses could be recorded and compared. The sample was recombined and put back\nthrough the entire sorting process as part of this exercise.\nReport into the Construction and Demolition Waste Stream 25", "text_len": 1964, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Five composite portions,\neach consisting of two 20L containers, were removed from the nominated sample and sent to a\ngeotechnical laboratory for analysis.\n• Purity Audits\nThe contractor was required to conduct random purity audits on sorted and classified waste materials\nfrom the medium-size fraction. This was to demonstrate the accuracy of the hand sorting and classification\nof the waste materials, which was required to be >95% accuracy. The contractor was required to submit\ndocumented evidence that random purity audits had been completed for each of the samples analysed.\nA-3 Chemical Analysis\nChemical analysis of the fine-size fraction of the mixed C&D waste stream was undertaken, as well as chemical\nanalysis of wood samples that were retained from the audit.\nA-3-1 Wood Waste\nDuring the audit, 250 individual wood samples were collected from mixed C&D waste stockpiles. Characteristics\nof the wood such as source, age and particle-size were collected for each sample.\nThe samples were prepared using a hammer mill and analysed for a range of chemicals. The results appear in\nAppendix 2.\nA-3-2 Fine Fraction\nA 40kg sample of material less than 30mm was collected during the audit from each stockpile. The samples were\nthen sieved on a 4.75mm screen to assist in determining the material components of the small-size fraction. Any\nmaterial that passes through the 4.75mm sieve has been defined as belonging to the fine-size fraction, which may\nconsist of soil as well as other materials such as plasterboard that has broken down before being received at the\nlandfill. It was hammer milled before chemical analysis.\nA wide suite of potential chemicals that may be present in the Fine Fraction (~150 chemicals) was tested to\ndetermine the concentrations for each stockpile sample. A summary of the chemical results appear in Appendix B.\nA-4 Other Issues and Data Quality\nDuring the course of the audit fieldwork operational issues were identified that had the potential to affect the\nquality of data collected. Where possible, DECC staff and the contractors conducting the audit work identified and\nresolved these issues. Some of the predominant issues that became apparent during the audit are described in the\nfollowing section.\nA-4-1 Safety Issues\nA-4-1-1 Site Supervision\nSome issues were raised and resolved by landfill operators, DECC personnel and the Waste Audit contractor to\nensure safety and work method procedures were strictly followed, including the need to use personal protective\nequipment (PPE) when hand sorting the 30 to 300 mm size fraction, mobile plant isolation procedures and sub-\ncontractor training for access to the landfill sites.\n26 Report into the Construction and Demolition Waste Stream", "text_len": 2870, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "17.Report into the Construction and Demolition Waste Stream Audit 2000-05.pdf", "page_num": 6, "text": "A-4-2 Site Management\nA-4-2-1 Ground Surface Sampling\nOne of the limitations of the audit process was the contamination of the sample stockpiles from the ground\nsurface on which they were built. There was no access to areas of hardstand on which to construct the sample\nstockpiles. All sites ensured that the audit area ground surface was well compacted, and in some cases site\noperators laid down areas of crushed rock and brick to increase the stability of the ground surface and further\nminimise the possibility of contamination.\nA sample was removed from the completed stockpiles for analysis by either a bobcat or front-end loader. The\nplant operators conducting this sampling were extremely careful not to disturb the ground surface when cutting\nthese samples but it should be noted that the precautions used generally had one of two consequences:\n1. To leave a small amount of the required sample in situ from running a front-end bucket through\nthe sample just above ground level.\n2. To incorporate a small amount of ground surface material in the sample due to uneven ground\nor running the front-end bucket through the sample just below ground level.\nA-4-2-2 Moisture Content\nSome minor elements of the audit fieldwork were conducted during periods of rain. It was not possible to cover the\nstockpiles in these circumstances and moisture ingress may have occurred during the construction of stockpiles.\nAlthough the sample material taken from the stockpiles at each landfill site for analysis varied in moisture content,\nmost of the fine-size fraction had consistently low moisture levels (<5%) due to minimal rainfall during the audit.\nNo additional moisture testing on the concrete or plasterboard material fractions were required due to the\nminimal rainfall during the audit.\nA-4-2-3 Ferrous Metal Recovery Practices\nSome of the participating landfill sites employed different resource recovery practices for ferrous metals at the tip\nface, which were often removed from the tip face by an electro-magnet attached to an excavator. The efficiency of\nthis operation is dependent on the following:\n• visibility of the individual items of material in mixed loads of waste\n• the diligence of the plant operator\n• the amount of time each day that this operation can be conducted.\nFor these reasons the recovery rates of ferrous metal at different sites on any given day can vary dramatically.\nThe stockpiles created at landfill sites that employed this method of ferrous metal recovery, were constructed\nfrom vehicle loads as they entered the site, prior to disposal. The quantity of ferrous metal disposed is therefore\nprobably slightly overstated. This factor should be taken in to consideration when reviewing the data.\nA-4-2-4 Mechanical Plant\nTwo different types of mechanical sorting/processing plant were used during the audit as two sites were being\naudited at any one time. These plant items used different mechanical processes for sorting the sample material.\nThe Doppelstadt trommel uses a rotating drum screen to separate material, whereas the Pitbull plant uses a\nvibrating flat screen to separate material. These two different processes mean that the particle-size and shape\nof greater than 30mm particles that passed through different screen sizes varied slightly between the two plant\nunits. The difference is not significant for total stockpile composition, however the composition of the small-size\nand medium-size fractions may differ slightly.\nThe Doppelstadt trommel was fitted with raised conveyor belts for the segregation of fine-size particle fraction.\nDuring periods of high wind there was a small loss of this fraction as it fell from the raised belt into the skip bin\nthat had been positioned underneath to collect it.\nReport into the Construction and Demolition Waste Stream 27", "text_len": 3811, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "17.Report into the Construction and Demolition Waste Stream Audit 2000-05.pdf", "page_num": 7, "text": "A-4-3 Data Management\nA number of minor issues arose with regard to the management of data during the course of the field audit and in\nsome of the post-audit laboratory analyses. These issues were resolved during the audit. These issues were:\n(a) Daily reconciliation of data sheets to ensure that all data is captured and that all data sheets are completed\ncorrectly and quality checked for errors. This includes, but is not limited to, a daily check and reconciliation of:\n• Data sheet totals\n• Material codes for each data entry (includes material name and code)\n• Completion of all data sheet specific information (site ID, date, sheet number, sub-stream ID, stockpile ID,\nsample ID, sort number, etc)\n• Sample totals (when analysis of a sub-stream or stockpile is completed).\n(b) Labelling of all samples collected to ensure that they can all be linked to the stockpiles from which the\nsamples were originally taken.\n(c) Chain of custody and sign-off procedure for all samples removed from site to ensure that at all points of\ntransport, analysis and storage the samples can be clearly identified and accounted for.\nA-4-4 Data Quality\nThe challenge with collecting data about C&D waste is the natural variance in particle-size and weight of materials\ndisposed to landfill. This natural variance combined with variance associated with sample surveys was recognised\nas a potential risk to the reliability and usefulness of the data obtained through the audit.\nThe material type data collected through the Mixed C&D Waste Audit was subject to differing degrees of variance.\nThe estimates for common materials such as concrete, timber and fine-size particle fraction are considered reliable\nfor the purposes of this report. While estimates for materials less prevalent such as textiles and paper/cardboard\nare subject to sampling variability too high for practical purposes.\nThe desktop audit data is considered to be of high reliability because the data relates to the amount of levy to be\npaid and is subject to an audit process that carries potential penalties for incorrect reporting.\nFurther analysis of data quality can be found in Appendix D.\nThe Mixed C&D Waste Audit was undertaken at selected landfill facilities in the SMA. The selected landfills\nparticipating in the audit in 2004-05 disposed of 88% of mixed C&D waste and 77% of all waste from C&D sources\nin the SMA.\nThe results of the Mixed C&D Waste Audit show that by weight the main material types of mixed C&D waste are\nconcrete (22.9%), fine-size material (21.6%) and timber (20.0%).\nThe fine-size fraction is defined as the material less than 4.75mm in size, which was the smallest size fraction that\nparticle composition was undertaken.\nChart 9 below shows the composition by weight of mixed C&D waste. Major material types are presented on the\nchart with individual material types that comprise less than 3% grouped into the other material type.\n28 Report into the Construction and Demolition Waste Stream", "text_len": 2979, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

One potential cause of this evident\ndichotomy could be the timber treatment based on ‘CCA’, which is more prevalent in softwood that has recently\nbeen generated as waste during construction activities.\nThe very high chemical levels of copper, chromium and arsenic (CCA) present in treated timber can impact on the\nquality of wood waste recovered for recycling. One piece of CCA treated timber (1,000 to 3,000 mg/kg of copper,\nchromium or arsenic) can significantly alter the average concentration of a batch of waste wood, which would\notherwise contain very low natural background levels (1 to 3 mg/kg).

A less distinct relationship occurs for cadmium.\nAdditionally, most of the samples that have high concentrations of lead, cadmium and zinc are sourced from\ndemolition waste. Table 10 presents average concentrations for a number of criteria such as source, type of wood\nand age of the wood waste.\nWaste wood that has been processed to recover recyclable materials (i.e. sourced from MRF vehicles) appear to have\nrelatively low lead, zinc and cadmium concentrations. This may be a result of the physical removal or breaking down\nof the paint or varnish film during processing at a C&D MRF.

These chemicals\nare discussed below.\n• Lead\nTotal lead levels (mg/kg ‘as received’) in the fine-size fraction were consistently high from all sources.\nHowever small vehicles had more than four times the concentration found in either large vehicles or MRF\nvehicles (~950mg/kg compared with ~200mg/kg) . The high lead levels could be related to demolition and\nrenovation waste material that contain lead-based paints or lead-containing dusts or soils.\n• Sulphate\nAgain, reasonably high levels of sulphate were found in the fine-size fraction regardless of source flow.\nTypically the range was 6,000 to 12,000 mg/kg. The maximum observed level was 20,000 mg/kg in one MRF\nvehicle sample. The small-size fraction of the same sample had 1.7% plasterboard, so it is likely that the high\nsulphate level is due to plasterboard.\n• Hydrocarbons C15-C28 & C29-C36\nMost samples taken from the fine-size fraction had levels of hydrocarbons between 100 and 500 mg/kg,\nalthough a small number of samples had substantially higher levels (1,300 to 3,300 mg/kg).\n• Benzo(a)anthracene\nThe typical level within the fine-size fraction ranged between 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg, although a number of\nsamples had levels of 1.0, 1.6 and 7.6 mg/kg.\n• PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons)\nLow levels of a range of PAHs were found. Average concentrations for Benzo(b)fluoranthene, Fluoranthene\nand Pyrene in the range 1 to 2mg/kg.\n• Bis-2-ethyl hexyl phthalate\nThe typical level within the fine-size fraction ranged between 1 and 5 mg/kg although three of samples\nexhibited levels 10 times higher at 21, 32 and 38 mg/kg. These ‘spikes’ in concentration occurred across all\nthree source streams – large, small and MRF vehicles.\n• Pesticides\nOne sample, sourced from MRF vehicles had a total of 3.6 mg/kg of the pesticides DDD, DDE and DDT.\nA different sample, sourced from a large vehicle had 0.2 mg/kg of Chlordane. Other pesticide levels were\nlower than the detection limits of the analytical test method.\nThe results of other chemical analysis, which do not affect the appropriate recycling of C&D waste may be\nof interest for minimising total waste-management costs. Drying out or ‘pre-treating’ waste may lower the\nenvironmental impact of waste disposed to landfill but there would appear to be little benefit derived from\ndrying Fines from mixed C&D waste before disposal. Most samples had < 5% moisture, with only 3 samples having\nbetween 5% and 10% moisture.\n44 Report into the Construction and Demolition Waste Stream", "text_len": 2732, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Asbestos: asbestos and asbestos-contaminated material required to be disposed to landfill.\nAsbestos contaminated-soil is the primary component.\n2. Contaminated soil: soil that has contaminants (excluding asbestos) at levels considered ‘solid’\nor ‘industrial’ according to the NSW Waste Classification Guidelines and for which there are very\nlimited environmentally appropriate recycling or re-use options.\n3. Other waste: is the balance of materials, much of which is mixed C&D waste generated by the\nconstruction and demolition industry as well as residual materials from which material of value that\ncan be reprocessed or recycled has been removed.\nChart 27 below shows the material composition of C&D waste disposed to landfill in the SMA for the 2004-05\nfinancial year. The data is sourced from the Waste Contribution Monthly Reports submitted to the Department of\nEnvironment and Conservation NSW by licensed landfills under Section 88 of the Protection of the Environment\nOperations Act 1997.\nChart 27: Composition of C&D Waste Disposed to Landfill in the Sydney Metropolitan Area, 2004-05\nAsbestos\n(and asbestos\ncontaminated\nwastes)\n24.7%\nOther waste\n54.1%\nContaminated\nsoil 21.1%\nThe Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery Strategy, 2003, has set the target for the recovery and use of secondary\nresources from the C&D waste stream at 76% by 2014.\nFrom the Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery – A Progress Report, 2004, the recovery and use of secondary\nresources rate for C&D waste was reported at 75%.\nThe composition of C&D waste disposed to landfill as shown in Chart 1 indicates the there is currently very limited\nopportunity to appropriately recover 46% (contaminated soil 21.1% and asbestos 24.7%) of this material. Therefore,\nfuture improvements for recovery of C&D waste will come from the ability to recover material from the other\nwaste component. It also needs to be understood that a significant portion of other waste has already been sorted\nrepeatedly to extract valuable material.\nTo identify the potential for further recovery of secondary resources from the other waste currently disposed\nto landfill it is important to consider the monthly flow and quantity of this material. From January 2000 to June\n2005 the average monthly quantity of C&D waste disposed to landfill has been 96,000 tonnes with other waste\ncomprising 63%.\nIn the 2004-05 financial year the average monthly quantity of C&D waste disposed to landfill has been 109,000\ntonnes with other waste comprising 54%.\nTable 12 shows the monthly average disposal of the C&D waste by material type.\nReport into the Construction and Demolition Waste Stream 45", "text_len": 2804, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The Australian Bureau of Statistics defines these errors as;\nSampling error: is the difference between the estimate derived from the survey and the ‘true value’ that would\nbe obtained if the whole target population were included.\nNon-sampling error: are errors caused by the process or operations of the survey and can be grouped into two\nmain types. These are systematic and random errors.\nSystematic errors (called bias) make the survey results unrepresentative of the target population by distorting the\nsurvey estimates in one direction. For example, if the auditors consistently incorrectly classified ferrous metals as\nnon ferrous metals.\nRandom error can distort the results but tend to balance out on average. An example, is a concrete brick classified\nas a clay brick will more than likely balance out with a clay brick classified as a concrete brick.\nD-2 Sampling Error\nTo minimise sampling error the Mixed C&D Waste Audit undertook a multistage sampling methodology using a\ncombination of stratified and cluster sampling techniques.\nThe sample was stratified by landfill size (based on the quantity of mixed C&D waste disposed) and source flow\n(the vehicle type transporting this waste to landfill). This analysis identified 11 stratums for sampling.\nCluster sampling involved unloading truckloads of mixed C&D within each stratum into 100m3 stockpiles, which\nwere then mixed. From each 100m3 stockpile a ~10m3 sample was randomly selected for measurement.\nThe measurement process further stratified the sample into particle size fractions, with all material in each of the\nlarge-size fraction (>300mm) and medium-size fraction (30-300mm) measured and a sample of the small-size\nfraction (4.75-30mm) selected for laboratory analysis. The fine-size fraction (<4.75mm) was weighed and classified\nas a distinct component without compositional analysis.\nMixed C&D waste is comprised of heterogeneous materials with potential large variation in size. To understand the\nstandard error of the sample selection process, analysis was undertaken on 5 samples from a single\n100m3 stockpile.\nAlthough we are attempting to measure sampling error caused by sample selection there is potential non\nsampling error affecting the results depending on how thoroughly the 100m3 stockpile was mixed before sample\nselection. An example, is the material type plasterboard in the large-size fraction which comprised only 11% of\nsample 3 but 56% of sample 2. This is more than likely the result of large sheets of plasterboard not thoroughly\nmixed through the stockpile.\nCharts 29 to 31 show the average composition of each size fraction within the 5 stockpiles measured with the\nstandard error measured at 90% confidence. As an example, for timber in the large-size fraction there is a 90%\nprobability that the true compositional value is within the interval 30% to 50%.\nDue to the heterogeneous composition and variance in particle size of mixed C&D waste, the standard error in\ncomposition was not unexpected.\n48 Report into the Construction and Demolition Waste Stream", "text_len": 3244, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For the Mixed C&D Waste Audit, the physical\nsort and classification of materials was a stage in which non-sampling error could influence the results. As part of\nthe quality assurance procedures and to understand the magnitude of possible non-sampling error at this stage of\nthe audit, a stockpile sample of the medium-size particle fraction was sorted then mixed and re-sorted four times.\nThe object of the re-sorting process was to undertake a quality check on the ability of the auditors to consistently\nidentify and correctly classify each material. The results are presented in chart 33 below.\nThe chart indicates that concrete and timber appear to be the most difficult material types to consistently classify,\nhowever, further investigation revealed that the quantity of concrete and timber after each successive re-sort\nwas decreasing because the mixing process of trommelling the materials after each re-sort was causing physical\nbreakdown, allowing them to pass through the 30mm screen into the small-size fraction.\nAfter taking into consideration the physical breakdown of material through trommelling, the material classification\nability of the auditors was of a high order. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the results have been\naffected by non-sampling error associated with the material sorting and classification stage.\nChart 33: Non Sampling Error of Stockpile Re-sort Medium-size fraction\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\nMaterial\nThe physical sort and material classification of the audit required two sorting teams. Although, the methodology\nwas prescriptive there is the risk that results have been affected by the interpretation of the methodology by each\nsorting team. During the audit both teams sorted samples from stockpiles within the same stratum.\nIt is expected that the material composition of C&D waste within the same stratum should be similar. Therefore\nanalysis was undertaken on the results achieved by each team when working on samples in the same stratum to\nassess whether there were significant variations between the teams.\nOf the 15 material types measured, at 90% confidence, the result is a statistically non significant difference\nbetween sort teams A and B. The meaningful result is that the variability in the estimates makes the confidence\nintervals for each material so broad that the statistical result was not unexpected.\nThe small number of samples available for direct comparison between sort teams A and B contribute to the\nvariability of results. In the first stratum, team A measured 4 samples compared to team B’s 2 samples. In the third\nstratum, team A measured 2 samples compared to team B’s 3 samples.\nThe results are presented in Chart 34.\nReport into the Construction and Demolition Waste Stream 51\n)%(\nnoitisopmoC\nrebmiT etercnoC stcudorp\nyalC\nlarutaN etagergga dna\nrepaP\ndraobdrac citsalP suorreF suorref-noN dna\nnedraG\nnoitategev suoenallecsiM\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ", "text_len": 3265, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
