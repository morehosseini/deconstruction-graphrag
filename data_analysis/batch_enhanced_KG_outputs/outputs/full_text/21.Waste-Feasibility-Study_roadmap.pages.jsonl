The Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications is conducting\nan inquiry into the waste sector.1 The recently enacted changes to China’s waste importation policies through\nthe ‘National Sword’ initiative have also highlighted the need to better value-add to our waste products locally in\nAustralia.\nWe are seeking pathways to achieving the ambitious goals outlined in the ACT Waste Management Strategy 2011-2025.\nThe strategy includes the aspirational targets of 90 per cent of waste being diverted from landfill by 2025 and a\ncarbon-neutral waste sector by 2020.\nHowever, the Territory’s resource recovery rate has plateaued at around 70 per cent for the last decade, and the\nwaste sector is unlikely to be carbon neutral by 2020 under current management practices.2\nThe need for a ‘step change’ in order to move beyond this plateau was recognised in early 2015.\nIt was understood at the time that any large-scale waste infrastructure options for the Territory needed to be\nconsidered carefully, as the facilities were likely to operate on multi-decadal timeframes.\nAs a result, the Waste Feasibility Study was funded through the 2015-16 Budget with $2.8 million over two years.\nThis document provides a summary of the Study’s achievements and recommendations, which aim to enhance\nCanberra’s reputation as a sustainable, progressive city with the ambition of having public, private and community\npartnerships work together to further opportunities.3\nThe recommendations will require community support and participation to succeed. The recent public interest in\nwaste provides a springboard for action and an opportunity to ignite the community’s enthusiasm.\nI invite the community to explore the recommendations in this report and have your say on how the ACT Government\ncan work together with the community to set the Territory on a path towards becoming a national leader in\nresponsible environmental management.\nMeegan Fitzharris\nMinister for City Services\n1 http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/WasteandRecycling\n2 Point Advisory Pathway Report: ACT 2050 emissions modelling – waste sector, 2017\n3 Chief Minister’s ‘Canberra: A Statement of Ambition’ page 12\n5", "text_len": 2698, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The recommendations are detailed in Section 5.\nGroup 1 – Roadmap recommendations\nDiverting organics from landfill\n1.1 Undertake a food waste reduction and recovery social marketing and education campaign for households and\nbusinesses\n1.2 Provide ongoing participation and support to the national food waste initiatives\n1.3 Implement a kerbside food and garden organics (FOGO) collection service aligned with the existing green bin roll-out\nprogram\n1.4 Identify a site and establish an organics processing facility to process both food and garden organics\nIndustry development and support\n1.5 Identify and facilitate market development for materials that are currently sent to landfill\n1.6 Establish Government ‘buy-back’ schemes for recycled products through procurement commitments (e.g. compost\nfrom organics, road bases from crushing of inert waste and glass fines)\n1.7 Design modified service contracts for existing services (e.g. gypsum, glass fines, crushing inert wastes), repair and\ndismantle (e-waste and mattresses), so these materials can be recovered and repurposed for beneficial reuse\n1.8 Design a modified commercial and industrial (C&I) waste service to allow source-separated (e.g. recyclables, organics\nand residual) waste for improved processing outcomes\n1.9 Design and establish improved advisory services to businesses around the ACT regarding how they can reduce their\nwaste to landfill and save costs\nEnergy from waste\n1.10 Develop a waste-to-energy policy for the ACT\n1.11 Investigate the establishment of a process engineered fuel (PEF) plant in the ACT\nACT Waste Feasibility Study - Roadmap and Recommendations - Discussion Paper 6\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nDiverting organics from landfill | \n1.1 | Undertake a food waste reduction and recovery social marketing and education campaign for households and\nbusinesses\n1.2 | Provide ongoing participation and support to the national food waste initiatives\n1.3 | Implement a kerbside food and garden organics (FOGO) collection service aligned with the existing green bin roll-out\nprogram\n1.4 | Identify a site and establish an organics processing facility to process both food and garden organics\nIndustry development and support | \n1.5 | Identify and facilitate market development for materials that are currently sent to landfill\n1.6 | Establish Government ‘buy-back’ schemes for recycled products through procurement commitments (e.g. compost\nfrom organics, road bases from crushing of inert waste and glass fines)\n1.7 | Design modified service contracts for existing services (e.g. gypsum, glass fines, crushing inert wastes), repair and\ndismantle (e-waste and mattresses), so these materials can be recovered and repurposed for beneficial reuse\n1.8 | Design a modified commercial and industrial (C&I) waste service to allow source-separated (e.g. recyclables, organics\nand residual) waste for improved processing outcomes\n1.9 | Design and establish improved advisory services to businesses around the ACT regarding how they can reduce their\nwaste to landfill and save costs\nEnergy from waste | \n1.10 | Develop a waste-to-energy policy for the ACT\n1.11 | Investigate the establishment of a process engineered fuel (PEF) plant in the ACT", "text_len": 4427, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

{"source_file": "21.Waste-Feasibility-Study_roadmap.pdf", "page_num": 8, "text": "SECTION 1\nOVERVIEW OF MODERN WASTE MANAGEMENT\nThe Study was tasked with identifying how to achieve best practice waste management in the ACT.\nThe ‘circular economy’ was identified early as the model which can counter the existing ‘linear economy’ that exists in\nAustralia and encourages the purchase and consumption of complex materials that end up in landfill.\nThis linear economy is unsustainable as it requires more and more natural resources to be extracted to sustain high\nconsumption lifestyles.\nA circular economy aims to reduce environmental impacts by designing out waste and extracting resources from\nunwanted materials. This approach is enabled by changes to the waste system’s design, including through regulation,\nand is ultimately a market-driven model.\nAs a vehicle to achieving the circular economy, the Study has used the ‘waste hierarchy’ as a filter through which all\noptions were assessed. Figure 1 presents the hierarchy as an inverted triangle which places efforts to reduce, reuse\nand recycle waste above energy recovery and landfilling.\nFigure 1: The waste hierarchy\nREDUCE\nWaste generation\nREUSE\nGoods and` materials\nRECYCLE\nMaterial into new products\nRECOVER\nEnergy from suitable sorted\nmaterial\nLANDFILL\nThe waste hierarchy is the foundation of the ACT Waste Management Strategy 2011-2025 and is reiterated in the\nWaste Management and Resource Recovery Act 2016 (WMRR Act 2016). The hierarchy aims to:\n> minimise the generation of waste\n> maximise the recovery and re-use of resources\n> minimise the amount of waste that goes to landfill.\nThe waste hierarchy is also consistent with the Territory’s legislated greenhouse gas reduction target of net zero\nemissions by 2050, required in the Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act 2010.4\nWaste avoidance and reuse measures, particularly by avoiding the disposal of organic waste to landfill, can reduce\nthe generation of methane gas. This is a powerful greenhouse gas generated through the decomposition of organic\nwaste in landfills. The reuse of materials avoids greenhouse gases emitted in the production and transport of new\ngoods. The Study proposes projects and initiatives that respect the waste hierarchy and do not undermine higher\norder waste management options where they are available or where markets can be developed.\n4 http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2010-41/\nACT Waste Feasibility Study - Roadmap and Recommendations - Discussion Paper 8", "text_len": 2440, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Figure 4 below presents the number of tonnes and\npercentages for recycling in the three streams. The C&D stream makes up the largest proportion of waste generated\nin the ACT and also has the highest recovery rate at 86 per cent. This reflects the well-developed C&D recycling\ninfrastructure in the Territory.\nThe amount of C&D waste may actually be higher, as some C&D materials (such as bricks and mortar) can also be\nfound in the MSW and C&I streams.\nThe MSW and C&I waste streams also perform well at 58 per cent resource recovery, and recent indications from the\nNational Waste Report show that this is significantly above the national average.\nFigure 4: Three waste streams in the ACTError!

To this end, from\nmid-2015 to mid-2017, the Study accomplished the following key achievements:\n> established base-line data\n> established a regulatory framework through the WMRR Act 2016\n> consulted with commercial and community groups\n> oversaw industry development activities\n> implemented a market sounding to gauge industry capabilities\n> developed a Roadmap towards 90 per cent resource recovery\nThese achievements are outlined in the following sections.\nBASE-LINE DATA: YOU MEASURE WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT8\nOne of the first tasks for the Study in 2015 was to establish a baseline dataset as a solid platform to underpin research\nand analysis.\nData is critical to well-targeted, evidence-based and planned waste management. Data is also crucial for measuring\nperformance of key indicators, progress and impact.\nYet waste data is difficult and expensive to collect and, in the absence of a national standard, waste data collection\nand reporting methods vary by jurisdiction and waste types. Similar to other jurisdictions in Australia, the ACT faces\ninconsistencies in the quality, collection, storage, analysis and sharing of waste and resource recovery data.\nAn audit approach was used by the Study to gain an understanding of the life of waste, from generation to final\ndestination, and to quantify annual waste quantities and the ACT’s resource recovery rate. The most recent data at\nthe time of the Study was from financial year 2014-15, and this data formed the baseline.\nThe work involved analysis of waste management contracts and considered all existing data.\nLandfill quantities were derived from the weighbridge system used at landfill and transfer station facilities.\nRecycling quantities were obtained from the annual voluntary ‘Industry Recycling Survey of Waste Organisations’\nacross the ACT, undertaken by ACT NoWaste. The Study sought to cast a wide net and as such all quantities reported\nin the Recycling Survey were included in the baseline. One limitation of the voluntarily reported recycled material is\nthat material from neighbouring councils may be included but not separately identified.\nGaps in the data were identified, and these gaps were reconciled through consultation with internal and external\nstakeholders, industry experts and other waste operators. These gaps included data on the volume of waste\ntransported interstate, stockpiles of contaminated wood, and gaps in recycling data due to the voluntary nature of\nthe Recycling Survey.\nDRIVING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK\nThe Study played an integral role in establishing the WMRR Act 2016, which was passed in the ACT Legislative\nAssembly in August 2016 and came into effect 1 July 2017. This Act will improve data collection by requiring waste\nbusinesses to report their activities quarterly.\n8 Jan Gehls, architect and urban design consultant\nACT Waste Feasibility Study - Roadmap and Recommendations - Discussion Paper 12", "text_len": 3304, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

{"source_file": "21.Waste-Feasibility-Study_roadmap.pdf", "page_num": 16, "text": "METHODOLOGY\nIn developing the Roadmap, it was necessary to consider a wide range of technologies, initiatives and approaches.\nConsultation with community and industry ensured critical stakeholder views were considered, and a leading\nindustry consultancy was engaged to facilitate the adoption of optimal solutions.\nInitially, three pathways were identified which could take the Territory towards 90 per cent resource recovery, each\nwith a particular ‘output’ focus:\n> materials output focus – this pathway would separate waste streams, converting them into materials that have a\nvalue in existing or potential future markets\n> soil improvement focus – this pathway would produce soil-improving products and direct organic materials\nthrough a process of ‘anaerobic digestion’ to generate gas products for use in the local gas grid or as transport\nfuels\n> energy output focus – this pathway would use waste-to-energy processes (predominately anaerobic digestion\nand thermal treatment) to produce energy for the grid.\nThe next step established an assessment framework with a set of criteria against which the three resource recovery\npathways were evaluated. The framework considered:\n> focusing on waste streams that make up a large proportion of landfilled waste, so that implementation will yield\ntangible results\n> utilising technologies that are simple to develop and operate\n> collecting waste in a way that is convenient and efficient\n> providing options that have a low net cost\n> seeking strong potential markets for recycled products, understanding that some markets may require\ndevelopment.\nThe three resource recovery pathways were considered for synergistic qualities, innovation potential, and risk.\nSynergies are present when waste diversion options reinforce each other. Examples are composting products that\nare mixed with gypsum recovery products to create soil conditioners, or the repair-and-dismantle process providing\ntimber for further recycling. Innovation potential exists for certain options, such as the composting process, which\ncan facilitate future innovations in biochar and anaerobic digestion. Risks exist for all technologies and product\nmarkets, and these were considered in a risk matrix.\nThe criteria informed the final recommended Roadmap based on the materials output focus, depicted in Figure 6.\nThe recommended Roadmap would achieve resource recovery of roughly 87 per cent, which is just short of the\n90 per cent target by 2025.\nINITIATIVES\nThe horizontal axis of the diagram in Figure 6 shows recommended projects and initiatives, each delivering an\nincrease in resource recovery towards 90 per cent and are explained in further detail below:\nContainer Deposit Scheme (CDS) – a scheme established by legislation where a refundable deposit is paid on\nnominated containers. The deposit is redeemable upon presentation at collection points around Canberra. A CDS\nprovides an incentive for the return of containers rather than disposal via littering or general waste. The net outcome\nis a reduction of redeemable containers in recycling, general waste and public bins, as well as a reduction of these\ncontainers in litter.\nA CDS will be introduced into the ACT in 2018, and, as much as practicable, the ACT scheme will be harmonised with\nthe NSW scheme. The Study estimates a potential for approximately 2,600 tonnes of redeemable containers to be\nprocessed by the scheme.\nFood Waste Reduction Program – an education program designed to reduce waste, and specifically the generation\nof food waste. An element of this campaign will include support for food rescue by charities from commercial\nsources.\nACT Waste Feasibility Study - Roadmap and Recommendations - Discussion Paper 16", "text_len": 3715, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "21.Waste-Feasibility-Study_roadmap.pdf", "page_num": 17, "text": "A model program is the ‘Love Food, Hate Waste’ program which was implemented in the United Kingdom in 2007, and\nthe business case reported in The Business Case for Reducing Food Loss and Waste.10 By 2012 the program had led\nto a reduction in food waste of 21 per cent across the UK relative to 2007 levels. The ratio of purely financial benefits\nto financial costs attributable to the UK initiative was more than 250:1. That is, every British Pound spent resulted in\nsavings of 250 Pounds.\nSix west London boroughs also found substantial reductions in food waste when they implemented a food waste\ninitiative in 2012-13. Over a smaller time and geographic scale, a reduction of 15 per cent was realised with a benefit-\ncost ratio of 8:1 when considering just the financial savings to the boroughs. Similar savings were also realised for\nbusinesses that generate food waste.\nThe Study estimates there is potential to reduce the amount of food waste produced in the ACT by approximately\n8,000 tonnes.\nEnhanced recycling – by removing recyclables from waste currently sent to landfill via the transfer station by\ndiverting to a sorting facility and educating the community to remove recyclable materials from kerbside and\ncommercial rubbish bins. Enhanced recycling has a focus on large waste streams such as paper and cardboard,\nmetals, rubber, plastics and textiles.\nRecycling ultimately requires materials to be separated into different products, and then sold (or disposed) to\ndifferent manufacturers. The separation can be done either at source or at a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF).\nAt-source separation pushes sorting costs onto waste generators, and produces a product that is generally of a\nhigher quality than MRF products.\nRecycling leads to material streams that can be upcycled (purified of contaminants), remanufactured (converted\nback into their original product) or down-cycled (blended with other materials to produce a lower grade product).\nGlass fines processing – while glass may be infinitely recyclable, it is difficult to achieve this in practice due to the\neconomics of recycled glass compared to imported glass, combined with contamination issues and limitations on\nthe market to absorb recycled glass.\nDue to the limited glass-to-glass remanufacturing markets, glass is often converted into glass fines. Glass fines are\nprocessed through drying, crushing and screening to a range of size fractions. The potential markets for glass fines\ninclude aggregates for use in road base, and as a sand replacement in sand blasters and pool water filters.\nThe recent upgrade to the Hume MRF allows the facility to produce glass fines for use in construction. There is\nroughly 6,500 tonnes of glass available in the waste stream for processing into glass fines.\nRepair / Dismantle – a system where unwanted household durables are either repaired for resale or redistribution,\nor dismantled into their component parts. This process is highly labour intensive, but also adds significant\ncommunity benefit in the form of entry level jobs and high quality recovered products.\nFor the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that household durables that are unable to be repaired and resold are\ndismantled. In some cases, this results in 100 per cent resource recovery. In other cases, the recovery rates are lower.\nA key product from this diversion option is the recovered metals that are sold into global markets, and the net\nbenefits are social engagement and significant savings of landfill airspace from around 2,000 tonnes of recycled\nwaste. The ACT already supports initiatives such as Soft Landing Mattress Recycling.\nRecycling wood chip – which involves the shredding of waste timber and screening the shredded product to\nproduce different sized products for different markets. The shredding occurs in a two stage process: a low speed\nshredder on the first pass downsizes the material and removes large metal contaminants, while a high speed\nshredder reduces the size further for screening.\nProduct screened to a wood chip size is sold as a wood chip replacement, and is especially useful for particleboard\nmanufacture (a common application in Europe). All product below the specified size for particleboard is sold as\nanimal bedding, in particular to broiler sheds. Oversize product is shredded further.\n10 https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/safety/docs/fw_lib_business-case_en.pdf\n17", "text_len": 4413, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This is a well established market in\nthe USA, with substantial plants established to convert forestry wastes into biomass for export to Europe. The same\ncan be achieved on a smaller scale in the ACT by tapping into the 19,000 tonnes passing through the waste stream.\nCrushing inert waste – the crushing and screening of construction and demolition waste to produce landscaping\nmaterials and/or road base. Products are produced to varying specifications depending on their application.\nGovernment standards can be a barrier to market uptake of these materials. One common barrier to uptake is the\nrisk of asbestos in the material being crushed, and thus contaminating the final product.\nAn example of crushing already occurs at Canberra Concrete Recyclers in Pialligo. There are potentially 4,000 tonnes\nof construction and demolition waste available for processing in this way.\nGypsum recovery – a process that crushes plasterboard and screens out the associated paper, leaving gypsum\nas the final product. The screened paper can be processed through a composter or anaerobic digester. There is\napproximately 7,000 tonnes available for processing into recovered gypsum that can be used to manufacture new\nplasterboard or to amend soils (so-called “clay breaker”).\nComposting – with over one hundred composting facilities nationally, the technology involved is both simple and\nrobust, in either open windrows or proprietary enclosed systems such as Mobile Aerated Floor or tunnel composting\nsystems. Since composting generates significant odours and greenhouse gases that need to be controlled, an\nenclosed in-vessel system is required where the composting plant is near sensitive receptors. The amount of organic\nwaste available for processing is roughly 42,000 tonnes.\nProcessed Engineered Fuel (PEF) – PEF is created from waste in a process that removes incompatible materials and\nconverts residual high-calorific waste into a fuel that is transported for use in power plants distant from the site.\nThe power plant may be interstate or overseas.\nMuch of the residual waste currently sent to landfill in the ACT is of high calorific value and is suitable for use in energy\ngeneration for cement kilns outside the ACT. A PEF manufacturing facility within the ACT could offer an opportunity\nto convert a proportion of the 70,000 tonnes of residual waste into PEF fuels, and deliver around seven per cent\nimprovement in the Territory’s resource recovery rate.\nROADMAP - NEXT STEPS\nThe above Roadmap constitutes provides a pathway for achieving the objectives of the ACT Waste Management\nStrategy 2011-2025.

With each finding there is a list of initiatives – some are\nnew, while others build on current Government activities. Some are important to consolidate progress and designed\nto holistically and collectively achieve the Government’s aims.\nThe recommendations are divided into two groups.\n> Group 1 is the list of processes outlined earlier in the Roadmap in Section 4\n> Group 2 is a list of more general Roadmap initiatives. It is recommended that these be implemented to facilitate\nintegration with existing waste management operations. These initiatives are outlined in Section 6.\nThe Roadmap forms the basis of the Study’s recommendations and provides a pathway for the ACT to deliver its\nwaste management targets in a relatively low-risk, cost-effective manner using mature technologies. It does not\npropose novel technologies or complex processing options.\nThe Roadmap sets out a set of services that can be further negotiated with waste collectors and generators to\ndeliver materials to reuse and recycling facilities. It proposes support for the facilities through the ACT Government’s\nprocurement, and involves ongoing waste education and a minimum amount of regulatory change. The Roadmap\nalso establishes a wide range of opportunities for further development.\nIt creates the cornerstone recovery infrastructure and opens the door for entrepreneurs to lead with innovation in\nthe future.\nBased on expert analysis, it is estimated that the ACT would achieve a diversion rate of over 85 per cent once all\ninitiatives are successfully implemented.\nEach of the diversion options require investment in infrastructure (either from the ACT Government or via the private\nsector), and the development of markets. The ACT Government will be required to assist market development where\nit can, particularly through its own procurement and specifications.\nDIVERTING ORGANICS FROM LANDFILL\nFood loss and waste is a global problem that affects our economy, society and environment. In 2013 it was estimated\nthat food waste cost Australian households more than $8 billion each year. A report released by the Department of\nSustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities in 2011 estimated that Australians continued to\ngenerate 361 kilograms of food waste annually per person. The environmental cost is also significant and includes\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Nationally an estimated 6.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide was released as a result of\nsending organic waste to landfill in 2011.11\nThe ACT is not isolated from the consequences of such global challenges. In response, the ACT Government has\nadopted progressive policies that allow Canberra to grow and prosper, while reducing emissions, demonstrating\nleadership to other communities in Australia and around the world. The Government has established the goal of the\nACT being carbon neutral by 2050.12\nA key policy initiative to achieve this goal is the shift from high carbon-based sources of energy to clean,\nrenewable-based sources. As this transition occurs and the ACT’s carbon footprint declines, waste will constitute an\nincreasing percentage of the Territory’s carbon footprint unless positive action is taken to achieve carbon neutrality\nin waste management, such as the diversion of organics from landfill.\n11 Australian Department of Environment factsheet ‘Working together to reduce food waste in Australia’\n12 http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2010-41/current/pdf/2010-41.pdf\n19", "text_len": 3563, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

It should be noted that an opt-in, phased garden organics (GO) collection\nservice to the whole of Canberra commenced in April 2017 with a stepped roll-out until mid-2019. This offers further\nopportunity to align the two programs (GO and FOGO) so that a cost-effective service can be offered to the\nACT community.\nThe Study recommends establishing a comprehensive food waste reduction and recovery\nprogram (Recommendation 1.1)\nLike the FOGO initiative, a food waste reduction and recovery programme would be underpinned by the waste\nhierarchy’s primary principle of avoiding and reducing waste generation in the first instance.\nThis initial food waste reduction and recovery program, could be modelled closely on the highly successful Love\nFood Hate Waste program from the UK. Results from the UK indicate reductions in food waste of 15 to 20 per cent.\nThe financial savings, over various jurisdictions, range from $16 to $250 due to reduction of food waste for every\ndollar invested in the program.13\nLove Food Hate Waste helps hou seholds and businesses avoid food waste, save time and money, and reduce their\nenvironmental impact by planning better, shopping smarter and storing food effectively.\nThe program features tips on buying, cooking and storing food to avoid or reduce food waste.\nSimilar programs have been successfully implemented by NSW and Victoria. In NSW, the Love Food Hate\nWaste program14 is managed by the Environment Protection Agency and run in partnership with retailers, food\nmanufacturers, local government authorities and community or charity groups.\nTo be successful, these types of programmes as demonstrated in NSW and as the proposed approach for the ACT,\nrequire a collaborative approach across governments and related agencies, not-for-profit-organisations, local\nindustry, and small to medium businesses to drive and champion the initiative and ultimately implement.\nThis enables the benefits for the various food rescue charities to be realised and which in turn supports reduction\nof food waste.\nAlso supporting the primary principle of waste avoidance and reduction would be any future work looking to reduce\nretail and food packaging.\nThe Study recommends providing ongoing participation and support to the national food\nwaste initiatives (Recommendation 1.2)\nManaging food waste is at the forefront of the Australian Government’s agenda. It has begun promoting a strategic\ndialogue involving all state, territory, and local governments on food waste outcomes, standards, and reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions. The ACT Government was an active member of the Working Group for the National Food\nWaste Strategy, and the Study recommends continuation of this role and for the ACT to be part of the commitment to\ncutting the amount of food the nation wastes in half by 2030.\nAt the November 2016 Meeting of the Environment Ministers (MEM), ministers agreed that jurisdictions, led by the\nAustralian Government, would work cooperatively to support initiatives that lead to a 50 per cent reduction in food\nwaste. These initiatives included the formal development of the National Food Waste Strategy15 which was recently\nlaunched by the Federal Government.\n13 The Business Case for Reducing Food Loss and Waste, Champions 12.3, 2017\n14 http://www.lovefoodhatewaste.nsw.gov.au/\n15 http://www.environment.gov.au/protection/national-waste-policy/publications/national-food-waste-strategy\nACT Waste Feasibility Study - Roadmap and Recommendations - Discussion Paper 20", "text_len": 3997, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Waste audit reports indicate that\nfood organics comprise 37 per cent of kerbside waste collection (See Figure 7).\nFigure 7: Food organics in kerbside waste collection16\nResidual/Hazardous waste\nOther organics\nGarden organics\nTextile products\nMasonry materials\nTimber\nRecyclables\nFood organics 37%\nA number of submissions from the 2017 market sounding also promoted and detailed the benefits of kerbside FOGO\ncollection, as well as the issues of potential contamination. The introduction of a FOGO collection service will require\na high level of community engagement together with a comprehensive education program to ensure community\nbuy-in for ‘at source’ sorting of food organics.\nThe successful implementation of such a scheme is critically dependent on designing and undertaking effective\nlongitudinal education campaigns, which need to be launched well ahead of full roll out as well as staged and\nmaintained over a period of time. Ongoing education and communications with householders throughout the life of\nthe FOGO collection service is essential in order to maintain household participation, high diversion rates and low\nlevels of contamination.\nA FOGO service has been implemented in 38 local councils in Victoria and 26 in NSW. Penrith was one of the first\ncouncils to introduce a FOGO service and experienced a 30 per cent contamination rate. The Council undertook an\nextensive education campaign to reduce the contamination rate to 11 per cent, one of the lowest in Australia. Other\njurisdictions that have successfully implemented FOGO services include Albury, Parkes-Forbes-Bathurst, Lismore,\nBallina, Grafton, Orange, Wodonga, Indigo Shire, Wangaratta, Benalla, Strathbogie Shire and Moira Shire.\nThere are other considerations to developing a successful FOGO initiative. A FOGO service requires a lead time of\nat least five years in order to establish, test and commission a processing facility. Washington D.C. has recently\nannounced a FOGO service to be delivered in five years due to the need to secure a suitable processing site.17\nIdentification and approval of a site for a processing facility is a critical consideration before introducing the FOGO\ncollection service. The existing plan for a Canberra-wide GO bin roll out, is to be completed in 2019.\nSignificant planning and investment is required to align the proposed scheme with the existing opt-in GO bin roll out\nand the Territory’s existing kerbside collection contract, which expires in 2023.\n16 Based on 2014-15 baseline data.\n17 https://dpw.dc.gov/compostfeasibilitystudy\n21", "text_len": 2915, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Industry development is an iterative process that requires\nongoing engagement with industry groups and networks. It is essential to identify and facilitate the development of a\nmarket for recyclable materials.\nRecycling only makes sense if it is economically sound. This means recycling markets need to be supported for\ndevelopment.\nIn addition, the ACT Government has a range of policy tools available to facilitate the market economy transition to\na circular, low carbon economy. These tools include regulations, introducing price signals or product stewardship\nrequirements, procurement models such as public-private partnerships, and government purchasing to support\nmarkets for recyclable materials. However, policy measures to encourage recycling will only meet with limited\nsuccess if the markets for recycled products are not well developed and robust. Timber is a good example: it forms a\nlarge proportion of the ACT’s waste, roughly 45,000 tonnes of timber is landfilled annually.\nTimber waste arrives to landfill in various forms: plasterboard, chipboard, wood furniture, pallets, poles, stumps, logs\nand contaminated timber. Waste timber can also come from other waste streams while they are being processed\nand recycled. For example, mattress dismantling and recycling, and bulky kerbside waste collection. The Study has\nidentified an opportunity to process timber waste into products that have value in local, national and international\nmarkets.\nRecycled woodchip has a potential use for particleboard, animal bedding and coloured mulch. Woodchip is created\nby shredding waste timber and screening the shredded product to produce different sized products for different\nmarkets. Woodchip replacement is especially useful for particleboard manufacture. All woodchip below a specified\nsize for particleboard can be sold as animal bedding, in particular to ‘broiler’ meat chicken sheds in southern NSW.\nOversize product can be shredded further. The ACT Government can facilitate the identification of foundation\nmarkets in broiler sheds and regional feedlots, stockyards and saleyards.\nThe Study recommends establishment of government ‘buy-back’ schemes such recycled\nproducts through procurement commitments (Recommendation 1.6)\nThe previous example highlights the potential for the ACT Government to develop and support ‘foundation’ markets.\nThese are markets for products that are underdeveloped or non-existent, either within the ACT or around Australia.\nThe ACT Government has the potential to use its own procurement to develop and support these markets and, at the\nsame time, remove waste from landfill, often with social and economic benefits. A number of opportunities exist for\ncompost from organics, road bases from crushing and glass fines, where the former can be used in ACT parks and\nverges and the latter can be used in road bases.\nThe Study recommends designing simple and modified service contracts for existing\nservices such that these materials can be recovered and repurposed for beneficial reuse\n(Recommendation 1.7)\nThere are facilities in the ACT that convert or recover a number of waste materials such as glass fines, gypsum,\nand crushed inert waste so they can be used for better purposes. The ACT Government can seek to procure these\nproducts through a simple or modified service contract, where contractors are assured quantities of feedstock and\nmarkets for finished products.\nGiven the importance of markets, the ACT Government should also contract to purchase back a minimum quantity\nof some of these products, which will help develop new markets. There are also opportunities for social enterprise\nto establish a service contract for ‘repair and dismantle’ of valuable products such as e-waste, household goods or\nfurniture, modelled on the successful Soft Landing mattress facility.\n23", "text_len": 4190, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

As such, the role of the ACT Government is to influence buyers and providers of\ncommercial waste collection services. The Government can lead these conversations by co-designing collection\nservices with industry, and incorporating these services into planning approvals.\nThis will require the ACT Government working with collection service providers to develop a series of services that\nmeet the requirements of processing sites, collection needs and the needs of their customers. This is a ‘soft touch’\napproach as opposed to implementing interventions to make mandatory requirements by businesses to source\nseparate their waste, organics, and recyclables.\nThe Study recommends designing and establishing a more comprehensive advisory\nservice to businesses around the ACT regarding how they can reduce their waste to\nlandfill and save costs (Recommendation 1.9)\nThe ACT Government can provide advisory services to businesses to help them understand how to reduce their\nwaste management costs. There is capability within the Government for similar services. The Actsmart program\nbased within the Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development directorate (EPSDD) is an education and\nsustainability program established by the ACT Government to help ACT households and businesses manage their\nwaste, water and energy more sustainability. From the waste and recycling program established in 2009 (known\noriginally as OfficeSmart, then BusinessSmart), Actsmart has developed a suite of programs addressing broader\nsustainability issues for over 900 businesses across the ACT and Queanbeyan.19\nThe provision of advisory services to businesses could be largely modelled on the ‘Bin Trim’ program that has been\nimplemented in NSW. It is available for all small-to-medium businesses and tailored to encourage resource recovery.\nThe program includes an assessment of business practice, and an action plan with objectives to reduce waste and\nsave money. Rebates and grants are also made available to participants.\nNSW EPA reports that 20,000 businesses have increased recycling through the Bin Trim program.20\n19 https://www.actsmart.act.gov.au/what-can-i-do/business/recycling\n20 http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/managewaste/bin-trim.htm\nACT Waste Feasibility Study - Roadmap and Recommendations - Discussion Paper 24", "text_len": 2648, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

{"source_file": "21.Waste-Feasibility-Study_roadmap.pdf", "page_num": 26, "text": "While the amount of waste diverted from landfill has generally increased in recent years, there is relatively little\nenergy recovered from waste in Australia other than in cement kilns, where some waste such as PEF, oil products and\ntyres are used as supplementary fuels. Historically, WtE has faced a number of hurdles in Australia, including:\n> low landfill fees or levies and the availability of low-value land for landfills which make WtE financially\nuncompetitive\n> a lack of supportive State Government policies\n> low community acceptance.\nThe ACT has used thermal processing of waste to manage sewage solids since the 1970s, medical wastes since\nthe 1980s, and wood waste from C&D facilities since 2015. The ACT also uses small-scale WtE facilities in the form\nof extraction and combustion of methane gas from West Belconnen and Mugga Lane landfills. These two plants\ndivert collected landfill gas into a turbine to produce 27.5 gigawatt hours of energy each year. This energy, in turn,\noffsets the production of 117,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent each year through the burning of fossil fuels,\nand eliminates the vastly more detrimental methane from the environment22.\nThe ACT community has become increasingly aware of WtE over the last 12 months, driven in part by media\ninterest in waste and two high-profile WtE proposals. This public awareness is also reflected in many letters to the\neditor in newspapers by experts in the field, the general public, and community groups. Concerns have been raised\nregarding the perceived potential for pollution, and use of technologies that may disregard the waste hierarchy.\nThere has been a call for the ACT Government to adopt the NSW Energy from Waste Policy. These concerns were\nalso raised in the Study’s Community Reference Group meetings.\nThe waste industry has also expressed significant interest in the possibility of implementing WtE technologies\nin the ACT through their submissions to the Study’s market sounding. While most of the submissions mentioned\nelements of WtE, several submissions explicitly detailed projects that recover energy from waste. A common theme\nacross the submissions was an expectation of planning and regulatory change to promote and support WtE.\nInterest from both the community and industry means there is a need for a clear policy on WtE similar to other\njurisdictions in Australia. Victoria has published guidelines, Western Australia has a Position Statement and NSW\nhas a Policy Statement. The ACT needs to develop a policy on how it wishes to pursue WtE and in particular its\nattitude to innovation and risk. A well-developed WtE policy will provide greater certainty to the industry and\nclarity to the community, as well as a framework to the ACT Government for assessing WtE proposals. Such a policy\nwill also need to consider changes to the planning framework including the Territory Plan and the Planning and\nDevelopment Act 2007.\nThe Study recommends investigating the establishment of a PEF plant\n(see recommendation 1.11)\nIn the spectrum of WtE technologies, the highest risk approach is to use advanced thermal processing to make higher\nvalue products such as transport fuels or biochar. The lowest risk approach is to produce a processed engineered\nfuel (PEF) from residual wastes for export to interstate or international cement kilns or power stations. PEF can\noperate with flexible volumes of waste, and avoid the local community concerns around emissions associated with\nlargescale incineration plants.\nThe Study has identified that much of the residual waste currently sent to landfill is of high calorific value and is\nsuitable for the use in energy generation and cement kilns outside the ACT. A PEF facility within the ACT could\noffer an opportunity to convert the ACT’s residual waste into alternative fuels, and deliver around seven per cent\nimprovement in the Territory’s resource recovery rate.\n22 GreenPower Case study – Generator ‘Tipping the Balance’\nACT Waste Feasibility Study - Roadmap and Recommendations - Discussion Paper 26", "text_len": 4056, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

It repealed and replaced the Waste Minimisation Act 2001, which\nwas no longer appropriate for modern waste management in the current policy and commercial environment.\nThe new Act is designed to help the ACT meet the longer term resource recovery objectives of the ACT Waste\nManagement Strategy 2011-2025 of minimising the generation of waste and maximising the recovery of resources.\nIt responds to a range of concerns about the Territory’s capacity to manage waste and resource recovery, and to\nreduce the amount of waste going to landfill.\nThe Act establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for waste industry operators, and provides clear\nguidance for the industry and broader community on the appropriate storage, treatment and disposal of waste.\nThe new regulatory framework established by the Act is intended to facilitate and reward good practice in waste\ncollection, transportation, recovery and reuse, and to discourage the disposal of waste into landfill.\nWith this aim, the Act has clearly articulated regulatory, investigation and enforcement powers including data\ncollection. The overall regulatory framework requires the most comprehensive reporting of waste data in Australia,\nwith an estimated one million records to be provided each quarter by the regulated community. This data will inform\npolicy development and implementation in the ACT, and contribute to a national waste data set. Data volumes\nand the number of regulated entities will increase significantly over time as new programs are developed from\npolicy initiatives. An information and communications technology solution is required to manage all aspects of the\nregulatory framework.\nIn addition, the Act also allows for the introduction of mandatory Codes of Practice to provide clear guidance on\nthe central aspects of waste activity – particularly in relation to waste management businesses – and a flexible fees\nstructure, potentially in the form of a levy that promotes waste avoidance and resource recovery over landfill.\nThe regulations, and important statutory instruments such as Codes of Practice targeted towards C&I, and\nC&D sectors, are being developed as the implementation of the Act progresses.\nPRODUCT STEWARDSHIP\nThe Study recommends the ACT Government continue to explore product stewardship\npossibilities for various difficult waste streams to allow improved management of these\ntypes of waste materials (Recommendation 2.2)\nProduct stewardship is an approach to waste management that places shared responsibility on producers, retailers,\nusers and disposers to reduce the environmental impact of the waste generated. Following the adoption of the\nNational Waste Policy, the Commonwealth Product Stewardship Act 2011 was introduced to provide the framework\nfor product stewardship schemes. The Act creates three types of schemes: mandatory, co-regulatory, and voluntary\n(either accredited or not). Most schemes are voluntary, and include schemes for mobile phones (MobileMuster,\nwhich is an accredited scheme); fluorescent lamps (Fluorocycle, an accredited scheme); tyres (Tyre Stewardship\nAustralia); agricultural chemical containers (DrumMuster); paint (Paintback); PVC (PVC Stewardship); and newspapers.\nFurthermore the Federal Government has developed a number of mandatory and co-regulatory product stewardship\nschemes including for used oil and e-waste.\nPaintback is a product stewardship scheme launched in the ACT in July 2017. The scheme transports the collected\npaint to a treatment facility where containers and paint are separated for recycling purposes. To fund the collection\nand treatment of the waste paint and packaging, a levy of 15 cents (plus GST) per litre is applied to the wholesale\nprice of eligible products in containers over 1 litre and up to 20 litres sold in retail stores and paint trade centres.\nSimilarly, The ACT Government is also implementing a Container Deposit Scheme to recover used beverage\ncontainers, with refunds of 10 cents per container.\nACT Waste Feasibility Study - Roadmap and Recommendations - Discussion Paper 28", "text_len": 4319, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "21.Waste-Feasibility-Study_roadmap.pdf", "page_num": 29, "text": "The Study has identified six priority waste streams that are either hazardous in nature or currently end up in landfill,\nfor further investigation under product stewardship, and has also sought to understand any impact they may have if\nproduct stewardship schemes were introduced within the ACT. The six waste streams are handheld batteries, large\nbatteries, Expanded Polystyrene packaging, mercury-containing lamps, tyres, and disposable coffee cups.\nWhile there is a need for broader national support, opportunities for product stewardship policy promotion exist\nacross other policy options under consideration, especially given the supply chain and sustainability improvements\nof seeing product stewardship as going above and beyond just recycling.\nA range of voluntary and complementary approaches including codes of practice under the WMRR Act 2016 are\navailable to provide an innovative, facilitative environment for product stewardship in the ACT.\nENHANCED RECYCLING\nPeople don’t recycle as well as they could for a range of reasons. As reported in the 2014 kerbside waste audit, at\npresent recovery of recyclables from domestic kerbside waste in the ACT is at 66 per cent, meaning that 34 per cent\nof recyclable materials are incorrectly placed in the residual waste bins and are therefore lost from the recycling\nstreams. The audit further reports that multi-unit developments (MUDs) generate a higher proportion of unrecovered\nrecyclable material than single unit dwellings (SUDs).\nTo address and improve MUDs recycling performance, ACT NoWaste is leading a review of the ‘Development Control\nCode (the Code) for best practice waste management in the ACT’. The Code directs building design professionals on\nhow to incorporate best practice waste management principles and requirements into the design, construction and\noperation of new developments.\nThe Study recommends that the Code be reviewed periodically to maintain currency and\nto ensure desired waste management and performance outcomes are achieved for\nmulti-unit developments (Recommendation 2.3)\nThe review of the Code commenced in early 2017 with a special focus on improving controls in multi-unit dwellings\n(MUDs) and mixed use precincts. In the mid-1990s, ACT NoWaste issued the ‘ACT Waste Management Design Guide\nfor Site Storage and Handling of Waste and Recyclables in the ACT’. This guideline was replaced in 1999 by the\n‘Development Control Code for Best Practice Waste Management in the ACT’. The Code has been reviewed a number of\ntimes since.\nThe current review has been sparked by regular complaints to ACT NoWaste from residents, particularly from\nMUDs where waste management facilities are often non-compliant with the Code and associated allocations are\ninappropriate. Any non-compliance makes the provision of waste services more difficult and sometimes impossible\nto provide, which means owners corporations may need to arrange their own services at an additional cost on top of\nresident’s rate payments.\nIn addition, property developers and building designers have raised concerns that the existing Code is overly\nprescriptive such that some claim the ACT’s urban design outcomes ‘are driven by the size of waste trucks’.\nIndustry also claims that the Code does not allow for innovative and tailored outcomes for waste management\nin MUDs.\nThe current review presents an opportunity to improve resource recovery rates from underperforming MUDs, while\naddressing concerns of residents and the development industry. The review will also help achieve positive customer\nservice outcomes for the ACT Government.\nThe urban form in Canberra is changing, with the expansion MUDs and mixed use precincts being constructed.\nWaste management approaches change with time as well. The Code needs to keep up with a changing environment\nin the way our city is growing and waste management approaches are evolving.\n29", "text_len": 3890, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "21.Waste-Feasibility-Study_roadmap.pdf", "page_num": 30, "text": "While the revised Code will have a direct positive impact on the recycling performance of MUDs, ongoing support is\nalso needed for SUDs to reduce the amount of recyclables ending up in the kerbside residual bins.\nThe Study recommends an education campaign targeted towards enhanced recycling in\nkerbside bins (Recommendation 2.4)\nThe Study identified the need for greater investment in ongoing education as a means to improve recycling\nbehaviour among ACT community. The education campaign can be augmented by, initially, understanding the\nproblem for each demographic through market research, and subsequently designing an audit program to collect\ndata from representative areas within each demographic, understanding current performance and the response to\ninterventions.\nSPATIAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING\nDevelop an integrated long term strategic spatial plan for waste service delivery\ninfrastructure (e.g. transfer stations) and their locations, using the principle of best use of\nland to determine and meet future needs and changes (Recommendation 2.5)\nThe key locations for waste management facilities and infrastructure in the ACT are shown in the map within\nFigure 10. The facilities open to the public are:\n> Recycling Drop-off Centres (RDOCs) – government-owned, district level, are located on the edges of the town\ncentres. The RDOC model of service provision is mainly car-dependent, with residents and small businesses driving\nto drop off overflow from the recycling bin or larger items. The RDOCs are also used by rural residents of the ACT\nand the surrounding region.\n> Resource Management Centres (RMCs) – government-owned RMCs are located at Mugga Lane, Mitchell and\nWest Belconnen. The RMCs have diversion facilities, the Green Sheds for drop off and sale of second-hand goods\nat Mugga Lane and Mitchell transfer stations – to drop off and re-direct waste for sorting different waste groups\nincluding hazardous wastes. Co-located with these centres are green waste drop-off facilities for vegetation\n(leaves, grass clippings and branches) which is mulched or composted. The Mitchell waste facility provides both\nRDOC and RMC facilities, no landfill, and a transfer facility for green waste.\n> Landfill sites – The ACT’s landfills at Mugga Lane and West Belconnen take waste collected and transported by\nGovernment, licensed contractors and the RMCs. Mugga Lane has been expanded and based on current and\nexpected rates of waste generation has capacity until 2023.\nThe West Belconnen landfill accepts asbestos contaminated C&D materials. The ACT Government has committed\nto the closure and rehabilitation of the West Belconnen RMC site as part of its contribution to the Ginninderry Joint\nVenture (West Belconnen Joint Venture Agreement 2011). Key functions of the site will need to cease by the end of\n2019 and alternatives found in order to allow for land release as part of the Ginninderry development.\nThe West Belconnen Resource Management Centre currently provides a range of valuable functions. There will be\ncosts associated with finding alternative arrangements, in addition to the cost of site rehabilitation.\nThe ACT Government directs how and where the city grows and since the turn of the 21st century the overarching\npolicy has been to make Canberra a more compact and sustainable city, a policy objective that is being pursued by\nmost Australian cities. The current spatial planning policy, the ACT Planning Strategy 2012, identifies a target of at\nleast 50 per cent ‘greenfield’ residential estates versus 50 per cent infill with urban renewal and intensification to slow\nthe rate of city sprawl.\nTo accommodate our growing city, the ACT Government has a number of development ‘fronts’. These are locations\nwhere land is released for new housing developments as well as precincts where redevelopment to a higher density\nurban form is prioritised. These development fronts are locations where high volumes of C&D waste are generated\nduring development and where increasing quantities of MSW will be generated as the population grows.\nThe strategic intent of the ACT Government is that Canberra will be a small, sustainable, liveable city; that is a\ndestination of choice for knowledge workers, providing a high quality of life through an attractive public realm, well\nmanaged services and a vibrant community. Canberra will increasingly provide a diversity of dwelling types and\nlifestyle choices. The lower density suburbs will remain dominant, but with an increasing proportion of higher density\nprecincts, townhouses with gardens, apartments and mixed-use buildings.\nACT Waste Feasibility Study - Roadmap and Recommendations - Discussion Paper 30", "text_len": 4684, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

{"source_file": "21.Waste-Feasibility-Study_roadmap.pdf", "page_num": 32, "text": "Planning for this future, including for future waste facilities, infrastructure and services, needs to take account of\ndemographic changes, societal trends and the patterns of urban growth over time. The existing system of waste\nfacilities and services were well suited to Canberra’s low density suburban form and lifestyles that were prevalent in\nprevious decades. The composition of our community and our choices in how we live and work has fundamentally\nchanged over the last 20 years. Furthermore, the waste policy objectives have moved from protecting population,\nhealth and environmental amenity to achieving sustainability through resource recovery. Hence, our waste services\nand infrastructure need to be reconsidered to meet current and likely future needs. Historically, appropriate\nplanning for waste infrastructure was based on opportunities presented around location and facility design of the\ntime. However, there are greater pressures such as population growth and government and non-government waste\nfacilities need to now consider appropriate geographic location, efficient design and effectively laid out facilities.\nA major challenge for residential waste management is equality of provision for these different urban patterns.\nThe relatively simple and uniform facilities and services needed in low density suburban areas are different to the\ncomplex solutions required to achieve sustainable waste outcomes from mixed use, high density buildings with\ndiverse ownership and management structures, and public spaces used intensively all the time. The nature of\nworkplaces has also changed in the last 20 years and this has implications for the waste materials generated.\nIt is therefore recommended that the ACT Government take a strategic approach with a focus on customer\nexperience and service level. A network based approach to waste infrastructure planning is recommended, with a\nlifecycle consideration of operational and capital costs.\nA typical waste network is comprised of collection systems, customer-facing infrastructure (such as transfer stations),\nand processing and disposal facilities. Each of these elements is integrated and decisions in one part of the system\ninvariably have an influence on other parts of the system. Future flexibility and adaptability to change is therefore\ncritically important in waste infrastructure planning.\nWASTE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY\nThe Study recommends that the Strategy be reviewed immediately to reflect the changes\nsince 2009 when the Strategy was compiled (Recommendation 2.6)\nThe Government is committed to improving the Territory’s performance in waste management. This is reflected in\nthe ACT Waste Management Strategy—Towards a Sustainable Canberra 2011-2025 which was released in 2011.\nThe Strategy is the principal Government policy statement outlining resource recovery aspirations and future\ndirections.\nThe Strategy was an extension of the 1996 No Waste by 2010 Strategy which successfully reduced the waste sent to\nlandfill from nearly 60 per cent of total waste in 1995–96 to below 30 per cent in 2003-04.\nThe study found that the strategy’s goal and objectives remain aligned with the ACT Government’s climate change\nand sustainability agenda. Its objectives are aligned with the National Waste Policy 2010 and are broadly consistent\nwith the policy objectives of other Australian jurisdictions and leading international jurisdictions. However, various\ntargets and actions within the 2011 Waste Strategy have been superseded by events of the last six years. In particular,\nmajor new policies have been announced including a kerbside garden waste collection service, a domestic bulky\nwaste collection service, and a CDS. Furthermore, new direction from Government on FOGO, the development of the\nrecent WMRR Act 2016, and any new waste-to-energy policy, in aggregate, mean that a formal review of the Strategy\nis overdue.\nIn addition, the Strategy mandates self-review every three to five years to maintain currency and align it with changes\noccurring in waste management practices around the world.\nACT Waste Feasibility Study - Roadmap and Recommendations - Discussion Paper 32", "text_len": 4160, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

These include the plastic bag ban, the CDS and the activities of City Services.\nThe NLI is critical to assessing the efficacy of these initiatives, as it is the primary source of data on litter and illegal\ndumping.\nThe ACT Government has supported the NLI since 2006. In July 2017, State and Territory officials convened to\ndiscuss the strengths and weaknesses of NLI and agreed to a plan. In principle agreement was reached between the\nparticipants on a variety of measures, including the sharing of raw data and a peer review of methodology by the\nCSIRO.\nACT NoWaste has funded the 2016-17 NLI from existing budgets and agreed in principle to fund it in 2017-18.\n33", "text_len": 1186, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The next steps are for the ACT NoWaste\nbusiness unit within the TCCS directorate to implement the Study recommendations through a program of projects\nfunded within the bounds of the Territory Budget.\nMany of the recommended steps have already commenced – the WMRR Act 2016 is now being enforced by TCCS,\nand the ‘green bins’ pilot project is assessing the future volume of garden organics and associated processing\nrequirements. The CDS has been established by legislation and will commence in 2018. Education recommendations\nshould be integrated with existing communications teams in TCCS and complement work conducted in other\ndirectorates such as the Actsmart program.\nFINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS\nThe estimated financial impacts of implementing the Roadmap are in the range of $5 to $10 million per annum, with\nthe assumption that the majority of the initiatives would be carried-out on behalf of the Territory by the private\nsector.\nThe true financial impact of implementing the initiatives will be dependent on foregone revenue from landfill gate\nfees and the investment in infrastructure some diversion options require (either from the Territory or via the private\nsector) or the development of markets. The ACT will assist in market development where it can, particularly through\nits own procurement and specifications.\nFurther benefits arise from the impact that diversion of waste from landfill would have on the lifespan of the\nMugga Lane facility’s existing cells and future cells from around the year 2022. The lifespan of a landfill is dependent\non several variables, including the rate of ‘settling’ over time and other engineering factors such as ‘overtopping’\nwhich can extend the life of a cell. In any case, the landfill is a significant asset for the Territory and the prolonging of\nthe useful life of this resource is a key benefit of higher resource recovery.\nIt is intended that the first stage Roadmap projects materialise in budget business cases. This will establish the\nframework for the Roadmap, including designing education campaigns, specifically reduced food waste and\nenhanced recycling, industry development consultancies and the development of a waste-to-energy policy.\nIMPLEMENT TWO MAJOR EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON FOOD WASTE\nREDUCTION AND IMPROVED RECYCLING\n> Kerbside bin audits reveal that up to 37 per cent of ACT household rubbish bin contents are food waste and\n25 per cent are recyclables. The successful UK program Love Food Hate Waste provides a model which has\nreportedly reduced residential and commercial food waste in London by 15 to 20 per cent. A food waste reduction\nprogram could see over 8,000 tonnes of waste diverted from landfill each year.\n> Recycling behaviours would be improved by programs similar to those implemented by NSW local governments,\nincluding Albury and Wodonga’s Halve Waste and Hunter Region Councils’ Small Acts Big Change.\nEnhanced recycling could see 10,000 tonnes of recyclables diverted from landfill each year.\nESTABLISH A COMPOSTING SITE TO PROCESS FOGO\n> In anticipation of the expansion of the current green bins service to a FOGO service in five years’ time, it is\nrecommended that TCCS commission a siting study. A facility could be established through a ‘Build/Own/Operate’\nmodel with a gate fee charged to the Territory for municipal FOGO waste.\nThis facility could also accept FOGO waste from commercial operators which would further improve the Territory’s\nresource recovery rates. It is estimated that a composting site and FOGO collection service could see over\n40,000 tonnes of waste diverted from landfill.\nACT Waste Feasibility Study - Roadmap and Recommendations - Discussion Paper 34", "text_len": 3878, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Industry consultants would be engaged to assess various market and government\nprocurement opportunities. These initiatives could see over 40,000 tonnes of waste diverted from landfill.\nINVESTIGATE THE ESTABLISHMENT A PROCESSED ENGINEERED FUEL (PEF)\nFACILITY\n> The Study has identified that much of the waste currently sent to landfill is of high calorific value and is suitable\nfor use as PEF which is a fuel that could be sold to energy generators and cement kilns outside the ACT. A PEF\nfacility can operate with flexible volumes of waste, and would reduce local community concerns around emissions\nassociated with large-scale incineration plants. Consultants would be engaged to conduct a siting study and\nmarketing plan in preparation for a tender process in the subsequent years. The PEF facility could see up to\n70,000 tonnes of waste diverted from landfill.\nDEVELOP A WASTE-TO-ENERGY POLICY\n> The Study has found that the community and industry would benefit from a clearer understanding of the\nACT Government’s position on waste-to-energy.\nREVIEW THE ACT WASTE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY 2011-2025\n> The ACT Waste Management Strategy 2011-2025 should be reviewed to reflect the changes since 2009 when the\nstrategy was drafted, and any new direction from Government.\nHAVE YOUR SAY\nThe Waste Feasibility Study body of work has given TCCS a better understanding of local and national waste\nmanagement systems, their sensitivities and areas for improvement.\nThe Study recommends that ACT NoWaste conduct a thorough consultation program to allow key stakeholders to\ncomment on the Roadmap report.\nThis will occur over the first half of 2018.
