Through,\nRecycling Victoria, the Industry and Infrastructure Investment Package will provide $100\nmillion to the sector. Our investment will drive research, expand the local processing and\nmanufacturing industry, create more products from recyclable materials and support new\nlocal jobs.\nThe Industry and Infrastructure Package is designed to assist businesses to improve the\nquality of materials recovered and increase its resilience to changing market conditions for\nrecycled commodities. Our record investment will foster business innovation and\ncollaboration across supply chains to reduce waste, increase recycling and reuse, and\ngenerate new streams of revenue.\nVictoria is well placed to overcome the challenges currently facing our recycling sector.

The high response rate for this year\n(86 per cent) demonstrates strong engagement from the sector.\nResource recovery covers a wide range of activities, including collecting waste, sorting\nwaste, reprocessing waste, manufacturing new products and producing energy from waste.\nThe VRIAR provides a detailed summary of the significant quantities of materials recovered\nvia reprocessing of waste in Victoria. These materials include aggregates, masonry and soil;\nglass; metals; organics; paper and cardboard; plastics; rubber; and textiles. The materials\nare sourced from municipal solid waste (households, also known as municipal or MSW),\ncommercial and industrial operations (C&I), or construction and demolition sites (C&D). The\nVRIAR also includes data estimates and trends for materials exported from Victoria for\nreprocessing and waste sent for landfill disposal in Victoria.\nThis year, the VRIAR includes insights from a wider range of sources to provide a more\ncomprehensive view of waste management in Victoria than in previous years.1 These\nsources include:\n» Environment Protection Authority (EPA) Victoria data on quantities sent to landfill\n» Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) commodity export data\n» Australian Plastics Recycling Survey on plastics consumption and recovery\n» Victorian Local Government Annual Waste Services Report 2018–19 on materials\ncollected from households in Victoria2\n» Recovered Resources Market Bulletin on resource recovery markets.\nThis report also contains a baseline measurement against the four key targets in the\nVictorian Government’s Recycling Victoria: A New Economy policy released in 2020.\nIn future editions of the VRIAR, data pertaining to the management of hazardous waste will\nalso be incorporated to create a single point of reference for waste and resource recovery\ndata in Victoria.\n1 The method used to compile this data is provided in Appendix A.\n2 A comparison of this dataset to VRIAR is provided in Appendix B.\n7 Sustainability Victoria", "text_len": 2340, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Total waste managed per capita in\nVictoria increased to 2.3 tonnes.\n» The increase in total waste managed was not due to changes in consumer practices but\nsharp increases in the amount of C&D waste generated and recovered over the last two\nyears because of land development and major public transport infrastructure works led by\nthe Victorian Government.\n» For some materials (mainly glass, and paper and cardboard), changes in the amount that\nwas locally reprocessed and exported for reprocessing reduced due to:\n– EPA Victoria non-compliance issues at sorting facilities resulting in site closures\n– materials entering storage with the intention that they would be later processed\n– global shifts in material commodity values and export market access\n– contamination rates in kerbside recycling collection bins.\nSector performance\n» The 3 per cent increase, from 2017–18, in waste going to landfill is lower than the 8 per\ncent increase in total waste recovered for reprocessing. Similarly, over 10 years, the\namount of waste going to landfill has increased by 1 per cent while the amount of waste\nrecovered for reprocessing has increased by 43 per cent, indicating greater circulation of\nmaterials (particularly from C&D) in the Victorian economy over time.\n» The quantity of waste recovered from Victoria’s municipal and C&D sectors increased (by\n9 and 15 per cent respectively) but decreased from the C&I sector (6 per cent) in\n2018–19.\n» Diversion rates for materials collected from MSW (43 per cent) and C&D (87 per cent)\nincreased in 2018–19 compared with 2017–18; however, the diversion rate for C&I\n(61 per cent) decreased.\n» Recovery from the C&D sector accounted for 61 per cent of the total recovered materials\nreceived for reprocessing in Victoria in 2018–19, followed by C&I (27 per cent) and\nmunicipal (12 per cent).\n» The proportion of material recovered from each source sector varied. Key sectors with\nthe highest levels of materials recovered include:\n– 98 per cent of aggregate, masonry and soil recovered for reprocessing came from the\nC&D sector.\n– 91 per cent of glass recovered for reprocessing came from the municipal sector.\n– 86 per cent of mixed food and garden organics and 90 per cent of garden organics\nrecovered for reprocessing came from the municipal sector, and 65 per cent of timber\ncame from the C&D sector.\n– 88 per cent of paper and cardboard recovered for reprocessing came from the C&I\nsector.\n– 93 per cent of plastics recovered for reprocessing came from the municipal and C&I\nsectors.\nVictorian Recycling Industry Annual Report 2018–19 9", "text_len": 3212, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This material made up close to\n60 per cent of all material recovered for reprocessing in Victoria. The next most frequently\nrecovered material for reprocessing was metals (14 per cent) followed by organics, and\npaper and cardboard (both 12 per cent).\n» The amount of aggregate, masonry and soil recovered for reprocessing continued to\nincrease (to 6.32 million tonnes, up 15 per cent from 2017–18) as a result of continued\nland development and public transport infrastructure works across Victoria.\n» There was a 16 per cent decrease in the amount of paper and cardboard recovered and\na 15 per cent decrease in the amount of glass recovered in 2018–19 compared with\n2017–18. This decline is due to:\n– sorted materials not meeting import country contamination requirements\n– sorting losses as a result of increased contamination from kerbside recycling bins\n– mixed recyclable materials entering storage due to sorting site closures, with the\nintention that they would be sorted later, so impacting on the amount of material\nflowing through the system\n– changes in the commodity value of paper and cardboard throughout 2018–19, again\nleading to increased storage of sorted material.\n» The volume of organics recovered for reprocessing increased by 20 per cent in 2018–19.\nThis is likely to be due to increased collections of food and garden organics from\nhouseholds and businesses.\n» The amount of plastics recovered for reprocessing increased by 4 per cent. Demand for\nplastics in local markets is increasing – the amount reprocessed locally increased by\n16 per cent in 2018–19 while the amount exported for reprocessing decreased by 4 per\ncent.\n» There was a 1 per cent increase in the amount of metal recovered from 2017–18. This\ntrend was consistent with previous years.\n» The amount of rubber reprocessed locally decreased by 30 per cent (13,000 tonnes).\nThis is because of a spike in reprocessing quantities in 2017–18 due to tyre stockpile\nclean up rather than a significant decrease in 2018–19.\n» Overall the materials that had the highest diversion rates were metals (91 per cent),\naggregates masonry and soil (85 per cent) and glass and paper and cardboard (70 per\ncent each). For each source sector the materials with the highest diversion rates were:\n– in MSW, metals (91 per cent), glass (83 per cent) and organics (44 per cent)\n– in C&I, metals (92 per cent), paper / cardboard (77 per cent) and organics (50 per\ncent)\n– in C&D, metals (90 per cent), aggregates masonry and soil (89 per cent) and organics\n(51 per cent)\n10 SSuussttaaiinnaabbiilliittyy VViiccttoorriiaa\n10", "text_len": 2748, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

In the same period, 443,000 tonnes of garden organics was collected, a 4 per\ncent decline was observed possibly due to the prevailing drier climatic conditions\nexperienced in 2018–19.\n» All 79 Victorian local governments provide some form of kerbside bin service to\nhouseholds. A total of 57 (72 per cent) local governments employed a 3-bin system while\n22 (28 per cent) of local governments employed a 2-bin system in 2018–19.\n» The cost to councils of providing a kerbside service increased by 14 per cent compared\nwith 2017–18. The largest increase is attributed to recyclables, where the cost of the\nservice rose by 49 per cent or $39.7 million dollars across the state. This is likely to be\nassociated with the changing market value of kerbside recyclable materials.\n» Almost 40 per cent of kerbside collected recyclables was sent to overseas markets for\nremanufacturing.\n» The contamination rate in kerbside recycling bins was between 15 and 20 per cent.\n» At the beginning of 2020 there was an estimated 100,000–200,000 tonnes of kerbside\nrecyclables in metropolitan storage, mostly accumulated through 2018 and early 2019 as\na result of SKM sorting facility closures.\n» Commodity values for kerbside recyclable materials varied considerably throughout the\nyear: glass and mixed plastics (plastic numbers 3 to 7) had a negative commodity value;\nsingle stream HDPE and PET had commodity values over and around $400/tonne and\naluminium over $1,000/tonne; and mixed paper and cardboard and single stream old\ncorrugated cardboard ended 2018–19 with a similar value to the start of the year.\nLocal reprocessing versus material exported for reprocessing\n» Victoria’s resources were predominantly reprocessed locally with 90 per cent of all\nrecyclables processed within the state.\n» Materials collected from MSW are particularly export exposed, with almost 40 per cent of\nall materials collected from Victorian households in 2018–19 heading overseas for\nreprocessing.\n» The quantity of materials exported for reprocessing overseas decreased by 11 per cent\ncompared with 2017–18 to 1.12 million tonnes, as exporters were unable to find overseas\nmarkets for recyclable materials and the amount of materials from sorting facilities\ndeclined.\n» More than 90 per cent of glass and organics, and more than 60 per cent of metals, and\npaper and cardboard were reprocessed in Victoria. More plastics and rubber were\nexported for reprocessing than were reprocessed in Victoria.\n» The top 10 receiving countries of Victorian exports accounted for 94 per cent of all\nmaterial exported. China (24 per cent), Indonesia (17 per cent), India (14 per cent) and\nBangladesh (11 per cent) accepted the most by weight.\n» Monthly exports of paper and cardboard made up the largest component of kerbside\nrecyclables that were exported for reprocessing, peaking at 14,100 tonnes in April 2019.\nExports of plastics and metals were fairly steady across the year and exports of glass\nvaried month to month in 2018–19.\nVictorian Recycling Industry Annual Report 2018–19 11", "text_len": 3360, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

During these closures, there was a sustained\npractice of sending unsorted and single stream recyclable material to storage with the intent\nthat it would be sorted or sold and reprocessed at a later date. Data in this report shows the\nimpact of this practice, especially for paper / cardboard and glass. When SKM went into\nliquidation in October 2019 (The Age 2019), much of this material remained in storage. The\nRecovered Resources Market Bulletin from June 2020 (Sustainability Victoria 2020) notes\nthat most of this stored material is now reported to have been removed, with most of it going\nto landfill.\nSKM sorted the kerbside recyclables from 33 of 79 Victorian councils and when the\ncompany was placed into liquidation, those councils had no other option but to send their\nkerbside collected material to landfill until an acceptable alternative could be found. The\nimpact of this practice, which occurred in October and November 2019, is not present in the\ndata detailed in this report as it occurred in the 2019–20 financial year.\nGlobal shift in recovered material imports\nThe 2018–19 financial year saw a national and global shift in how recyclable commodities\nwere utilised and traded. Following the enforcement of the Chinese National Sword policy\nrestrictions in January 2018, other countries followed suit to introduce similar restrictions. By\nJune 2019, eight countries had introduced restrictions or bans on the importation of\nrecyclable materials with many signalling that import restrictions would tighten further,\nespecially for bales of mixed grades of the same material. For some materials, Victoria has\na reliance on export markets for secondary reprocessing and manufacturing, especially for\nmaterials from kerbside recycling bins (plastics, paper and cardboard).\nMixed commodity values\nIn 2018–19, there was a fall in the value of mixed paper and mixed plastics arising from\nkerbside recycling, which reduced the overall sale value of kerbside recovered materials by\naround $60–$80/tonne (since the beginning of 2018). This had a significant impact on the\nkerbside recycling sector. Most of this loss is due to a fall in the value of mixed paper. A\nsignificant slump in virgin fibre (pulp) prices in the leading Chinese markets in May 2019\nflowed through to scrap paper and paperboard prices.\nKerbside contamination\nThe average kerbside contamination rate reported by Victorian councils to the 2018–19\nVictorian Local Government Annual Waste Services Survey was estimated to be 10.5 per\ncent, an increase of 0.1 percentage points. The range reported by councils was between 2.6\nand 31.4 per cent in 2018–19. This rate represents contamination as the amount of material\nremoved during the sorting process (material that is incorrectly placed in the bin).

This rate represents contamination as the amount of material removed during\nthe sorting process (material that is incorrectly placed in the bin) plus the amount of material\nlost during reprocessing due to contamination of already sorted recyclables (single stream\nmaterial that is contaminated with other recyclables).\nMaterial flow changes in local and export reprocessing\nThe insights noted above effected a shift in the total volume recovered for reprocessing, the\nvolume locally reprocessed and the volume exported for reprocessing for a number of\nmaterials. Table 2 details the material volume flows in 2018–19 and how this changed\ncompared with 2017–18. Notably, the local reprocessing of glass decreased by 17 per cent\n(38,000 tonnes), which is likely to be a direct result of mixed recyclable materials entering\nstorage with the intention that they would be sorted later. Glass exported for reprocessing\nincreased by 24 per cent (or 2800 tonnes). This material is often exported following material\nrecovery facility (MRF) sorting and the glass beneficiation process (the process used to\nremove contaminants and sort by colour and size). In a similar manner, the amount of paper\nand cardboard locally reprocessed and the amount exported for reprocessing both declined\nin 2018–19, down 10 per cent and 23 per cent respectively. There are likely to be a range of\nfactors impacting these flows, including:\n» sorted materials not meeting import country contamination requirements\n» sorting losses as a result of increased contamination from kerbside recycling bins\n» mixed recyclables entering storage with the intention that they would be sorted later, so\nimpacting on the amount of material flowing through the system\n» changes in the commodity value of paper and cardboard throughout 2018–19, again\nleading to increased storage of sorted material.\nTable 2: Material volume changes in local and export reprocessing in 2018–19 compared\nwith 2017–18, Victoria\nRecovered for Locally Exported for\nMaterial\nreprocessing reprocessed reprocessing\n6,315,000 6,315,000 0\nAggregates, masonry and soil\nup 15% up 15% No change\n195,000 180,000 14,000\nGlass\ndown 15% down 17% up 24%\n1,474,000 988,000 487,000\nMetals\nup 1% up 2% Negligible change\n1,316,000 1,303,000 14,000\nOrganics\nup 20% up 20% down 2%\n1,249,000 765,000 484,000\nPaper / cardboard\ndown 16% down 10% down 23%\n143,000 61,000 82,000\nPlastics\nup 4% up 16% down 4%\n72,000 30,000 42,000\nRubber\ndown 9% down 30% up 15%\nNumbers in table have been rounded and may not add up within the table or to other figures\nreported elsewhere in this document.\nVictorian Recycling Industry Annual Report 2018–19 13\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nMaterial |  | Recovered for |  |  | Locally |  |  | Exported for | \n |  | reprocessing |  |  | reprocessed |  |  | reprocessing | ", "text_len": 2899, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The fund awarded grants over\nseveral rounds, with many projects due to come online soon. In 2018–19, the following\ninfrastructure capacity was installed:\n» around 16,000 tonnes per year of sorting and flaking capacity for mixed plastics\n» over 500,000 tonnes per year for C&D material reprocessing\n» around 22,000 tonnes per year for glass beneficiation.\nIn addition to reprocessing infrastructure capacity, the fund also provided support to councils\nand private enterprise for new collection infrastructure to improve landfill diversion (for\nexample, local government food and garden organic waste collection service infrastructure).\nNew recycling products developed\nSustainability Victoria supported research, development and demonstration (RD&D) projects\nin 2018–19 that will increase the quantity of recycled products being sold in Victoria. There\nare often barriers that restrict the uptake of products made from recycled materials, such as\na lack of appropriate specifications and standards or the need for specific testing and\napprovals or product demonstration trials. The RD&D program seeks to support\norganisations to overcome these barriers. From December 2018, Sustainability Victoria\ncommitted funding to 12 projects totalling $2.1 million. Projects include:\n» conducting a demonstration trial of plastics and glass in concrete footpaths\n» developing a VicRoads specification for local roads that permits the use of crushed glass,\nconcrete and brick and another that allows use of crumb rubber in asphalt\n» constructing a demonstration road using recycled soft plastics, glass and toner cartridges\nin asphalt\n» conducting a field trial of soft plastics and glass in asphalt road surfaces\n» carrying out field testing and monitoring of recycled plastic railway sleeper performance.\nThe outcomes from these RD&D projects will provide the sector with new end-use markets\nfor material recovered for recycling.

These reforms will be delivered alongside investment and\ninnovation as a comprehensive package to provide reliable services and a strong industry\nfor the future. It will make sure services meet and exceed community expectations, putting\nan end to unethical operators and waste stockpiling.\nVictoria’s transition to a circular economy will be guided by four goals spanning the life cycle\nof materials (make, use, recycle and manage). Each goal is designed to maximise value and\nminimise waste.\n» Goal 1 – Design to last, repair and recycle. Generate less waste in businesses through\ninnovation and design; use recycled materials in products and consider impacts across\nproduct life cycles; and support business to explore new circular economy business\nmodels.\n» Goal 2 – Use products to create more value. Help people make smart purchasing\ndecisions and extend the life of products and support the reuse economy; and repair\ngoods where possible.\n» Goal 3 – Recycle more resources. Reform kerbside collections to generate more value\nfrom waste; improve the separation of recyclable materials; develop markets for\nrecovered materials; plan for and boost investment in recycling infrastructure; embed the\nwaste hierarchy in the management of materials; and support the development of\nappropriate waste-to-energy facilities.\n» Goal 4 – Reduce harm from waste and pollution. Protect communities and the\nenvironment from high-risk and hazardous wastes.\nThese goals align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,4 including Goal\n8 (‘promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for\nall’) and Goal 12 (‘ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns’).\nEnvironment Protection Amendment Act 2018\nThe Environment Protection Amendment Act 2018 provides the foundation for a\ntransformation of Victoria’s environment protection laws and EPA Victoria.\nIt includes a new approach to environmental issues, focusing on preventing waste and\npollution impacts rather than managing those impacts after they have occurred.\nThe legislation will enhance the protection of Victoria’s environment and human health\nthrough a more proportionate, risk-based environment protection framework that includes:\n» a preventative approach through a general environmental duty\n» a tiered system of EPA permissions to support risk-based and proportionate regulatory\noversight\n» significant reforms to contaminated land and waste management\n» increased maximum penalties\n» requirements for more environmental information to be publicly available\n» changes that modernise and strengthen EPA Victoria’s compliance and enforcement\npowers.\n4 See: https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/economic-growth/\nVictorian Recycling Industry Annual Report 2018–19 15", "text_len": 3251, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Of this, 14,400 tonnes (or 7 per cent) was exported for\nreprocessing. Over the last 10 years, the amount of glass reprocessed has varied\nconsiderably, as illustrated in Figure 9. Victoria now recovers 25 per cent more glass for\nreprocessing than it did in 2009–10. This is due to growing export demand and reuse of\nglass for road construction and asphalt production.\nOver the last five years, the quantity of glass recovered for reprocessing has varied\nconsiderably. The drop in quantities between 2014–15 and 2016–17 is likely to signify glass\nmaterial entering stockpiles following MRF sorting, which is not captured in the industry\nsurvey. The increase in 2017–18 is due to some of those stockpiled materials being used as\nreplacements for other materials in construction activities, with the capacity for this market\ncoming online in that year. The drop in 2018–19 represents issues associated with\nstockpiling of unsorted kerbside recyclable materials by former MRF operator SKM. The\nstockpiling of this waste was conducted towards the end of 2018 and the start of 2019 and\nwas not resolved before the end of the financial year. Evidence from the Recovered\nResources Market Bulletin (August 2019) suggests there was significant stockpiling\noccurring. According to the Recovered Resources Market Bulletin (June 2020), stockpiles\nhave been reduced and controlled in the first half of 2020, with much of this material going\nto landfill because it was heavily contaminated.\nFigure 9: Glass wastes recovered for reprocessing in Victoria, 2009–10 to 2018–19\nIn 2018–19, 91 per cent of total glass came from the MSW sector and most of this was\ncontainer glass as illustrated in Figure 10.

In\naddition to this, as of June 2020 a small number of Victorian councils have already\nintroduced a separate glass kerbside collection bin. These programs have a dual purpose.\nThe first is to improve the quality of glass material coming from kerbside and consumer\nsources.

The materials were then sorted at MRFs and either exported or\nreprocessed locally (with some to landfill) and then used in manufacturing new products.\nFigure 24 presents the estimated flows of materials from kerbside (MSW) collection through\nto processing destination as presented in the Recovered Resources Market Bulletin\n(Sustainability Victoria 2019).\nFigure 24: Flows of kerbside (MSW) collection materials in Victoria, 2018–19\nSource: Sustainability Victoria 2019\nEvident in Figure 24 is the amount of kerbside recyclables reliant on export markets as a\ndestination for remanufacturing, with almost 40 per cent of materials using this pathway.\nContamination in kerbside recycling bins\nThe difference between the recycling bin tonnage data presented in Table 7 and in Figure\n24 represents different data collection points and definitions of contamination. The data from\nthe Sustainability Victoria Victorian Local Government Annual Waste Services Report 2018–\n19 presents the contamination rate as the amount of material removed during the sorting\nprocess.

As a result, the Recovered\nResources Market Bulletin shows a larger volume of material being removed as\ncontamination and going to landfill from kerbside recycling collections.\nThe contamination rate reported by Victorian councils to the 2018–19 Victorian Local\nGovernment Annual Waste Services Survey ranged from 2.6 to 31.4 per cent. The average\nrecycling bin contamination rate for Victoria was estimated to be 10.5 per cent in 2018–19.\nThe rate reported in the Recovered Resources Market Bulletin was estimated to be between\n15 and 20 per cent for the same period.\n36 SSuussttaaiinnaabbiilliittyy VViiccttoorriiaa\n36", "text_len": 2081, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "24.Report-Victorian-Recycling-Industry-Annual-Report-2018-19.pdf", "page_num": 37, "text": "Storage of collected materials and the impact of SKM closures\nAt the beginning of 2020 there was an estimated 100,000–200,000 tonnes of kerbside\nrecyclables in metropolitan storage (including glass), mostly accumulated through 2018 and\nearly 2019 as a result of SKM sorting facility closures resulting from non-compliance with\nEPA Victoria site operating conditions (EPA Victoria 2019). During these closures, there was\na sustained practice of sending unsorted and single stream recyclable material to storage\nwith the intent that it would be sorted or sold and reprocessed at a later date. Data in this\nreport shows the impact of this practice, especially for paper / cardboard and glass. When\nSKM went into liquidation in October 2019 (The Age 2019), much of this material remained\nin storage. The Recovered Resources Market Bulletin from June 2020 (Sustainability\nVictoria 2020) notes that most of this stored material is now reported to have been removed,\nwith most of it going to landfill in mid-2020.\nSKM sorted the kerbside recyclables from 33 of 79 Victoria councils. When the company\nwas placed into liquidation, those councils had no other option but to send their kerbside\ncollected material to landfill because of limits on sorting capacity at other sites. During this\nperiod (August to November 2019), approximately 54,000 tonnes of waste was sent directly\nto landfill from council kerbside recycling bin collections. The sorting facilities previously\noperated by SKM were purchased by Cleanaway in October 2019 and have been\noperational since December 2019 of the same year (Cleanaway 2019).\nChanging value of kerbside collected recycling\nDuring 2018–19, commodity values for recovered kerbside materials from Victorian\nhouseholds varied across the year. Figure 25 presents the commodity values (in $/tonne) for\ntypical mixes of material type commodities. Evident from Figure 25 is that there was a wide\nrange of commodity values for sorted kerbside collected material in 2018–19:\n» Glass had a negative commodity value throughout the year, reflecting the lack of local or\ninternational demand for these materials. The commodity value of glass highlights the\ntrend of glass being used as a sand substitute in construction materials as opposed to it\ngoing back into glass products or packaging. The marker for this trend is likely to be the\ncost difference associated with glass beneficiation, which is required to reuse the material\nin products or packaging.\n» Single stream HDPE and PET had commodity values over and around $400/tonne while\nmixed plastics (plastic numbers 3 to 7) had a negative commodity value. This reflects the\ndemand from packaging manufactures for single stream commodities that do not require\nfurther processing.\n» Recovered aluminium had the largest commodity value; however, this decreased by\n19 per cent through the first half of 2018–19 but remained steady in the second half,\nreflecting the demand for this material. Steel maintained a steady commodity value\nthroughout.\n» The commodity value of mixed paper and cardboard did not improve throughout 2018–19\nand finished the financial year at $0/tonne. Single stream old corrugated cardboard\nended the 2018–19 year with a higher commodity value than when it started, reflecting\ndemand for this material for local packaging production.\nVictorian Recycling Industry Annual Report 2018–19 37", "text_len": 3380, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

It sought data from 98 Victorian waste reprocessing\nbusinesses (excluding the plastics reprocessors) via a voluntary online survey. The\nresponse rate to the 2018–19 survey was 86 per cent, an increase of 8 percentage points\ncompared with 2017–18. Only 14 businesses out of 98 did not respond. The survey\nparticipation rate was 69 per cent as 16 businesses requested to opt out of completing the\nsurvey. The reasons for opting out included the business being non-operational (due to\nequipment build or upgrades) in 2018–19, the business being sold to another business or\nclosure of the business. Despite a survey participation rate of 69 per cent, Sustainability\nVictoria is confident that it has captured responses from the major non-plastics reprocessing\nbusinesses in Victoria (Table 9).\nTable 9: VRIAS response rates, 2017–18 and 2018–19\n2017–18 2018–19 Change\nSurveys sent 95 98 +3\nSubmitted responses 66 68 +2\nOpted out response 8 16 +8\nAcknowledged but no response 21 14 –7\nSurvey participation rate 69% 69% No change\nResponse rate 78% 86% +8\nEach non-plastics reprocessing business was emailed a link to an online survey developed\nfor their specific industry category and asked to provide information for the 2018–19\nfinancial year about the amount of materials diverted from landfill (recovered) and\nreprocessed.

The\naccuracy of the information is verified by comparing previous years’ survey responses. Any\nsignificant variations are reviewed and adjusted upon consultation with the organisation. To\navoid double counting, adjustments are made to account for any transfers of materials\nbetween other Victorian reprocessors.\nAlthough the survey collects data across a range of activities including collecting waste,\nsorting waste, reprocessing waste, manufacturing new products and producing energy from\nwaste, the only information that is used in this report is the amount of material recovered for\nreprocessing by material type and source sector. Other quantitative and qualitative\ninformation from the survey data is used to supplement and support the findings in this\nreport.\nReprocessing recovered materials, typically an industrial process, results in a material or\nproduct that can be productively used. Energy recovery is the process by which embodied\nenergy is captured for use. It is a form of resource recovery, but it is not reprocessing.\nTo avoid double counting, this survey only focused on materials recovered for reprocessing\nand no other stages of the resource recovery life cycle, such as collecting, sorting and\nmanufacturing. The survey does not include materials that have been collected and baled\nonly (unless they are exported) or materials that have been stockpiled (the Recovered\nResources Market Bulletin provides further details on these materials). It also does not\ninclude materials that have been resold in their original state for reuse, such as clothing sold\nthrough second-hand or charity stores.\nIn 2018–19, Victorian reprocessors included:\n» smelters and foundries of steel, aluminium and other nonferrous metals\n» crushing plants and auxiliary screening of concrete, brick, asphalt and related materials\n» paper / cardboard and de-inking pulp mills\n» composting facilities\n» glass and rubber product manufacturers\n» plastics reprocessors.\nAustralian Plastics Recycling Survey\nData on plastics recovery was sought from 37 plastics reprocessing businesses in Victoria\nvia the 2018–19 Australian Plastics Recycling Survey. A total of 20 plastics reprocessing\nbusinesses responded to this survey in 2018–19, representing a 54 per cent survey\nparticipation rate. Table 10 presents the response rate breakdown from this survey. The\nresponse rate to this survey was 84 per cent as a further 11 organisations responded by\nopting out due to negligible processing during this time period or were not interested in\nparticipating in the survey. Only 6 reprocessors out of 37 did not respond.\nTable 10: Australian plastics recycling survey response rates in 2018–19\n2018–19\nSurveys sent 37\nSubmitted responses 20\nOpted out response 11\nAcknowledged but no response in time 6\nSurvey participation rate 54%\nResponse rate 84%\n48 SSuussttaaiinnaabbiilliittyy VViiccttoorriiaa\n48", "text_len": 2966, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The survey is voluntary, and the\ninformation is self-reported by the organisation. To avoid double counting of material flowing\nthrough the system to local reprocessors, the focus of data gathering in this survey was\nplaced on the reprocessing stage of the plastic life cycle.\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics data\nAdditional information was sought from the ABS on the export of materials from Victoria to\noverseas markets for reprocessing during the 2018–19 financial year. This data aims to\ncapture materials exported from companies not surveyed by Sustainability Victoria, such as\nexport traders. Additional ABS data on population figures, gross state product and consumer\nprice index were also used in our analysis.\nEnvironment Protection Authority Victoria data\nData on solid waste disposed of to licensed landfills was sourced from EPA Victoria’s landfill\nlevy returns. These returns provide data on MSW to landfill and combined solid industrial\nwaste to landfill, which is the sum of waste from C&I and C&D. To estimate the quantities of\nwaste going to landfill from these sectors individually, Sustainability Victoria applied an\nassumed proportional split. This allows for the calculation of diversion rates by source\nsector.\nVictorian Local Government Annual Waste Services Report and the\nRecovered Resource Market Bulletin data\nIn the 2018–19 version of this report Sustainability Victoria has endeavoured to include\nadditional data and analysis from our other data-related reports, the Victorian Local\nGovernment Annual Waste Services Report 2018–19 (VLGAWSR) and the Recovered\nResources Market Bulletin. Both reports focus on data related to waste collected from\nhouseholds in Victoria, which makes up around 20 per cent of all waste managed in the\nstate. The results from these data reports are used to inform wider industry trends. A\ncomparison of these datasets to VRIAR is provided in Appendix B.\nAccompanying data workbook\nThe findings in this report are based on the data findings provided in detail in the Victorian\nRecycling Industry Annual Report Workbook 2018–19. The workbook provides public\naccess to the underlying data and includes historically available figures.
