We have a Charter to promote the science and practice\nof building and construction for the benefit of society, and we’ve been doing that since 1834. Our\nmembers work throughout Ireland and worldwide in the development, conservation, and\nimprovement of the built environment. We accredit university degrees, educational courses and\ntraining in universities and colleges in Ireland. Our professional and vocational qualifications are a mark\nof the highest levels of competence and professionalism, providing assurance to clients and other\nprofessionals procuring built assets. The CIOB also has a dedicated policy and research function for\nIreland, whose expertise we have drawn on in the preparation of this response.\nWe support the transition from our current reliance on the linear economy to better embracing the\ncircular economy's principles. In particular, we strongly support a shift in culture and approach that\nencourages reuse and repair\nThere is a lot to be commended in the draft guidance document (the draft). Our response focuses on\nseveral key themes that, in our view, require further thought.\nThe tax system and the circular economy\nThe draft rightly points out the need to review legislation in the context of circular economy and design\nprinciples. It also suggests tax incentives for demolition ‘such as for recycling…’. Given the novelty of\nthe recommendations in the draft, a general taxonomy of all existing policy and legislation that impacts\nthe built environment needs to be created. The proposals in the draft should then be sense checked\nagainst this taxonomy. Where contradictions are identified between the draft and existing policy and\nlegislation, a decision needs to be made as to the correct course of action given Ireland’s climate\ncommitments.\nFor example, under Ireland’s current tax structure, a reduced rate of 13.5% VAT is applied to demolition\nprojects, creating a perverse environment where the embodied-carbon-hungry activities of demolition\nand replacement enjoy financial parity with the sustainable repair and restoration, of Ireland’s built\nenvironment. This contradicts the principles outlined in the Circular Economy and Miscellaneous\nProvisions Act 2022, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, and\nthe EU Taxonomy Regulation 2020 - an EU-wide classification system for sustainable activities. This\nreduced rate of VAT for demolition also acts antagonistically to many of the proposals in the draft.\nTo remedy this, the CIOB is proposing that the Government use the tax system to incentivise the repair\nand restoration over the demolition of buildings, thereby reducing the embodied carbon footprint of\nIreland’s built environment. Specifically, we are calling for demolition to be charged at the standard\nrate of 23% VAT, while repair and renovation activities remain at the reduced rate of 13.5%.\n37% of carbon dioxide emissions come from buildings. This means that the built environment sector\nhas a significant role to play in achieving Ireland’s net zero ambitions and tackling the climate crisis.\nRather than incentivising sustainable construction practices, Ireland’s VAT structure places demolition\nand rebuild on a parity with renovation and retrofit by charging both at the reduced rate of VAT –\n13.5%. This is facilitating a culture of demolish and replace, rather than add, transform, and reuse in\nthe construction sector.\nNew build projects are an essential component of the built environment, but the replacement of\nbuildings should not be given taxation parity with repair as retrofit buildings will often outperform new", "text_len": 3771, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Further, the demolition of existing buildings creates\nchallenges such as appropriate disposal of waste, dust exposure, and greenhouse gas emissions.\nRegulatory measures have proven effective in undergirding similar types of sectoral culture shifts from\ndemolish and rebuild to repair and reuse. For instance, landfill taxes and the application of an\naggregate levy facilitated a 70% decline in the amount of Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW)\ndisposed to landfills in the UK.1 International studies concluded that levies were more effective at CDW\nmitigation than financial incentives, achieving the targeted 30% reduction in CDW two years sooner\nand have the co-benefit of generating a new revenue stream.2\nGovernance\nThe issue of governance is crucial to a successful circular economy strategy. It is quite clear from the\ndiscussion document that the guidance will spill over into the remit of other departments – the\nDepartment of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and the Department of Finance are the most\nobvious, although there are others. As such, if the guidance is to evolve from a discussion document\ninto a set of clear policies, with concrete, enforced outcomes, other government departments need to\nbe brought on board. For instance, there is clear tension between what the guidance proposes, and\nthe existing tax system. Has the Department of Finance (DOF) been made aware of this guidance and\nthe potential implications it has for future budgets? What is the hierarchy between the guidance and\nexisting policies to which it will act antagonistically in terms of policy enforcement? These questions\nneed to be clarified at the outset of the guidance document’s life.\nAs per the point above regarding VAT, the DOF will be a key stakeholder if the draft is to be successful.\nIt is therefore disappointing not to see DOF named on the ‘Policy-makers and State agencies’\nstakeholder list, albeit it is mentioned once in the draft on page 31.\nAdaptable Buildings\nWe commend the aim to reduce future demand for new construction through design that supports\nadaptability, repair, and maintenance, in line with the indicators of the EU Framework for sustainable\nBuildings, Levels. The most significant environmental impacts of constructing a building relate to its\nstructure and facade. If the useful life of the building, and therefore also its structure, can be extended,\nthere can be significant environmental benefits.3\nWe support the idea laid out in the draft of scoring a building’s adaptability to change of use. We\npropose that this be germane to the decision to grant planning permission. While an adaptability\nrequirement this may be overly onerous on smaller developments in peripheral locations,\nimplementing an adaptability score is particularly important in central urban locations, where changes\nin demands for building types are frequent.4\nAs per the European Commission’s ‘Level(s) indicator 2.3: Design for adaptability and renovation guide’\na building’s adaptability score can provide a semi-quantitative assessment of the extent to which the\ndesign of a building could facilitate future adaptation to changing occupier needs and market\nconditions. It can therefore provide a proxy for the capacity of a building to continue fulfilling its\nfunction and to extend the useful service life into the future.\n3 Eu Levels: Adaptabiltiy\n4 See https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/opinion/2020/june/the-role-of-construction-in-delivering-\nsustainable-transport-post-covid-19", "text_len": 3550, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "40.CIOB Response to DECC Circular Economy Consultation.pdf", "page_num": 3, "text": "This adaptability score could be embedded in planning decisions, as part of a new development’s\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment, for instance. We recommend that this scoring mechanism be\nintroduced for all new buildings in central urban locations. The framework for such a spatially sensitive\npolicy is already in place in national planning guidelines, which, for instance, recommend that the\nquantum of car parking or requirement for such provision should depend on the location of\ndevelopment. In central urban locations, according to Planning Guideline 28,5 parking provision should\nbe minimised or eliminated, whereas in peripheral locations restrictions can be relaxed.\nA similar spatial criterion could be used to implement adaptability scoring in the assessment of a\nplanning application. New buildings in central urban locations, where demand for space changes –\nbetween office and residential, for example – could be required to achieve a certain adaptability score\nand this could be a factor in the decision as to whether to grant a development planning permission.\nThis would be in keeping with national panning policy, which prioritises dense, mixed-use\ndevelopment, as well as offsetting the need to repeatedly reproduce the most significant environment\nimpacts of construction – the structure and façade of a new building. By providing a score for\nadaptability, developers, local planning authorities and communities will be presented with clear\noptions to take a longer view on the design aspects and decisions that may influence the building’s\nservice life.\nDemolition Audits\nGiven the scale of building and demolition taking place in Ireland's cities, creating a publicly accessible\ninventory of the materials available from a building prior to its demolition could be a useful way of\nconnecting planned building projects to demolition projects such that optimal use is made of materials\nthat will otherwise end up in landfill. CIOB advocates for pre-demolition assessments in our work on\nsustainability. Pre-demolition assessments can establish an unbiased, qualified appraisal of a building’s\nviability, presenting the environmental and economic case for its repair or replacement. A pre-\ndemolition assessment would be an ideal opportunity to provide a publicly accessible inventory of the\nmaterials and resources available in the planned demolition project. Further, these inventories could\nlink in with community development projects locally to support community building projects. This link\ncould be given regulatory footing using the Office for Government Procurement’s implementation of\nsocial clauses in their work with the construction sector.\nPreserving and improving our existing built environment is a critical component of meeting our\nsustainability targets, fuelling our economy, creating good jobs and preserving our heritage. However,\ncentralised policy making rarely maps neatly to local circumstances. In some cases, demolition and\nrebuilding will be the right choice economically, environmentally, and socially. Establishing when this\nis the appropriate course of action, however, is challenging. Like many other areas of the construction\nindustry, there is a role to be played by suitably qualified property professionals in assessing and\ncharting the most sustainable and practical course of action at the potential end of a building’s life.\nTwo processes may offer solutions to these practical challenges. The first is to engage pre-demolition\nassessments to establish an unbiased, qualified appraisal of a building’s viability, presenting the\nenvironmental and economic case for its repair or replacement. These assessments would support a\ntransition to prioritising retrofit while remaining practically minded and responsive to each\nconstruction project’s individual needs and unique characteristics. The flexibility of the built\nenvironment should be prioritised so that buildings can reach their full life expectancy through being\n5 See https://www.opr.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2018-Design-Standards-for-New-Apartments-1.pdf", "text_len": 4073, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

It is nonetheless important to recognise that, in some cases, this will not be practical or\npossible.\nIn cases where demolition is an appropriate course of action, waste audits conducted by external\nauditors ahead of demolition could further support the mitigation of Construction & Development\nWaste (CDW). Research has demonstrated that pre-demolition audits are an ‘effective tool for\nenhancing CDW management practices’.6 In some cases, an internal version of these audits is already\nin use. However, the practice has not been widely adopted. Further, concerns have been raised\nregarding self-regulation. Considering these limitations there is a need for mandatory auditing systems\nthat don’t rely upon the industry’s self-policing but rather engage with specialised staff with the\nnecessary training to provide objective assessments and oversee waste management practices.\nImplementing these assessment and auditing systems could further support redressing the imbalance\nbetween replacing and repairing buildings in Ireland7 and support transitioning to the principles of the\ncircular economy. However, these systems will require upskilling industry professionals to understand\nbetter CDW practices and the recycling and reuse of materials\nResourcing\nThe draft mentions a lot of new duties, some loaded onto the planning system. There needs to be an\naccompanying resourcing strategy with the guidance this if this is the case, otherwise the guidance will\nsimply be giving more responsibilities to an already stretched local government sector.\nSkills, professional development, and professional bodies\nThe draft points out the role that professional bodies, including the CIOB, will play in upskilling the\nworkforce for a circular economy. The CIOB Academy already offers courses in the circular economy,\nwhich introduce circularity and how it works in the built environment. A panel of speakers from both\nIndustry and Government cover varied topics including Buildings as Material Banks (BAMB) and how\nthe public sector is facilitating circular economy, how the idea is applied to buildings and the policies\nthat are coming into play. We would be happy to provide a more in-depth overview of the other\ntraining courses that we offer to members if you think this would benefit that work that you are doing\nin DECC.\nFurthermore, the draft talks about introducing a Building Regulations Advisory Body, consisting of\nmembers of various stakeholders, e.g., RIAI, Engineers Ireland, Irish Planning Institute etc. We would\nrespectfully suggest that such a group could benefit from having a more international flavour given the\nprogress that has already been made in terms of circular construction policy in other countries. The\nCIOB partnered with the Construction IT Alliance (CITA) to run a circular economy series throughout\n2021 featuring a range of international speakers. We would be happy to discuss potential candidates\nfor this advisory body from our contributors to that series.\nFurther research\nThe draft talks about facilitating future research into a circular construction sector. In terms of the\nCIOB’s proposal to charge demolition at the full rate, following our proposal for a demolition levy in\nScotland, the CIOB has met with the Minister for Net Zero Buildings, Active Travel and Tenants’ Rights\nto organise that Scottish Government officials undertake a feasibility study in regards to the demolition\n6 See\nhttps://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/361629/TLALR1de1.pdf;jsessionid=B2075B910917F734FE\n4DE082F89DA8D1?sequence=1\n7 See https://passivehouseplus.ie/articles/design-approaches/deconstruct-ireland", "text_len": 3643, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

We would be happy to work with DECC to\norganise a similar study in Ireland to assess the feasibility of a change to VAT on demolition.\nMaterial Passports\nThe CIOB has done extensive work on building information, including a 2022 survey on the ‘golden\nthread’. Almost three-quarters of respondents to a CIOB survey on the ‘golden thread’ – the\nrequirement for accurate and up-to-date records of project data – said it should apply to all buildings,\nnot just the higher-risk residential buildings as set out in the UK government’s draft Building Safety Bill.\nThe research, carried out by the CIOB and software company i3PT Certification, asked industry\nprofessionals about their understanding of the golden thread and how it will be delivered in practice.\n74% of respondents felt the draft bill did not go far enough, and that the golden thread should become\nlaw for all buildings, while a further 13% said it was ‘relevant’ to other sectors. Many were concerned\nabout healthcare, care homes and schools.The research indicated that industry culture would be the\nbiggest obstacle to implementing the golden thread. Some 82% of respondents picked this out as a\n‘blocker’ to change, followed by commercial investment (52%), lack of repercussions (48%), unclear\nrequirements (43%) and technology (32%).Furthermore, more than half (54%) agreed with the\nstatement, “the industry understands the need to change but the right culture is not in place to\nsupport it”. Only 9% disagreed.\nThe consensus is it will take construction a long time to implement the changes necessary to deliver a\ngolden thread of information on all high-risk projects. Only 7% of respondents thought it would take\nless than 12 months, while one in five said it would take between one and two years. Some 41%\nthought it would require two to five years and 23% said over five years. Encouragingly though, 85% of\nsurvey respondents said the golden thread will “enable better decision-making and create a clearer\nchain of accountability across the built environment”. The ‘golden thread’ was identified by Dame\nJudith Hackitt in her Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety, published after the\nGrenfell fire. She highlighted the need for “robust record keeping, with a digital ‘golden thread’ of key\nbuilding information running through all phases of design, construction and occupation”.\nWe would be happy to discuss this submission in more detail.\n8 See https://www.ciob.org/industry/policy-research/levelling-playing-field", "text_len": 2868, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
