The report includes\nupdated forecasts for new home building and renovations activity nationally and for\neach of the eight states and territories.\n\n“Dwelling commencements in the Northern Territory have been very weak in the\nsecond half of 2023. This is the first time in over three decades that quarterly\ncommencements have fallen below 100,” added Mr Espinoza.\n\n“Total housing commencements are remarkably low at these levels, primarily driven\nby higher interest rates.\n\n“A slightly stronger recovery is expected in the second half of 2024, on the back of\nimproving economic conditions and government support, as the Territory's election\ntime in August nears.\n\n“A long-term recovery in home building requires a return of market confidence, growth\nin employment and population.\n\n“Promises of infrastructure and mining projects can help improve the current state of\nthe economy. There have been a couple of announcements in the last few weeks\nwhich might see some movement in the second half of 2024.\n\nMr Espinoza also said that the announcement and awarding for the development of\nthe new suburb of Greater Holtze will go some of the way in increasing housing supply\n\f", "text_len": 1437, "extraction_method": "ocr_tesseract", "fallback_attempted": true, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
