In a policy environment where environmental awareness and practices\nappear to be taking precedence, state governments have been aiming to raise\nawareness of waste management practices, and change actions that occur on site.\nWaste management is a complex issue for the housing industry as no single waste\nmanagement approach guarantees significant waste reduction and cost savings. The\nindustry is dominated by small to medium sized companies, for whom waste\nmanagement is costly, time consuming and often impractical. Significant barriers still\nexist for recycling materials. Individual companies are often frustrated as they feel\nthey cannot make a difference due to the lack of economies of scale for the disposal of\nrelatively small amounts of waste generated.\nThe key areas which impact on the level of recycling and reuse of material include the\nsignificant cost of recycling services, limitation and absence of recycling services, site\nconstraints and local government regulation. Until these matters are addressed and\nimproved, changes will be slow.\nEducation and innovation will assist with change and there some excellent industry\nand individual initiatives in practice. Some of these are outlined in this submission,\nincluding the HIA GreenSmart program.\nOf key importance to the Inquiry and the development of policy is the validity of\n(waste) data. Various data sets in existence have led governments to believe that the\nbuilding and construction industry is a major contributor of waste to landfill. Yet in\nthe absence of verification of the available (mostly aggregated) data, there is not much\nevidence to counter this.\nThe purpose of this submission is to highlight a number of the issue in more detail\nproviding information and feedback around waste management and resource\nefficiency with specific reference to the residential construction industry. The\ncomments through this response are largely as a result of the significant member\ninterest generated in the topic.", "text_len": 2142, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "39.Submission to the Productivity Commission on Waste Management.pdf", "page_num": 4, "text": "Structure of the Housing Industry and Waste Management\nWaste management strategies implemented by housing companies largely depend on\nthe size of the operation. The housing industry is highly competitive, containing more\nfirms than any other industry in Australia. But nearly all firms in the industry are\nsmall to medium sized, employing fewer than 20 people. Whilst the market is highly\nefficient, smaller housing companies have greater difficulty in being able to create the\neconomies of scale necessary to recycle and reuse products than many of the larger\nbuilding companies.\nWhilst some larger builders are able to generate sufficient economies of scale in\narranging for materials to be recycled, they also experience difficulty in finding\nservices that offer total solutions which include collection of all materials from site.\nThe industry’s reliance on trade contractors means that many building companies are\nalso working with multiple contractors, creating a number of constraints for recycling\nwaste materials. It is more difficult to implement systems for waste management with\nsuch a disparate workforce.\nData on Waste\nThe lack of reliable data on the nature of waste to landfill is a significant barrier to the\nmarket understanding the depth and breadth of this issue. There has historically been\nlittle reliable disaggregated data on construction waste available. Previous estimates\nhave been based on small samples of sites, using visual estimation of waste volumes,\n“snapshots”, government estimates and aggregated data rather than following a\nscientific process and studying selected landfill sites over time.\nData collected on waste generated from the construction industry does not usually\ntake into account the breakdown of waste between commercial and residential sites.\nThis is an important delineation as it is difficult to apportion waste to these sectors in\nthe absence of qualified data. Given the market structure of the commercial and\nresidential construction sectors, disaggregated data is critical.\nAccurate data is very difficult and time-consuming to collect due to the mixing of\nwastes on site and the effort required to collect, sort, categorise and measure the\nvolumes. However, in the absence of such information it is not possible to properly\nquantify the problem and respond with appropriate policies.\nRecommendation:\nGovernments should facilitate accurate collation and recording of data at landfill\nand recovery facilities.", "text_len": 2465, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Whilst this\npotentially creates more waste, it also ensures that multiple transport costs of material\n(from reordering) can be avoided. Even with the additional waste generation and\ndisposal costs, it is usually cheaper to operate in this way than to absorb costs\nassociated by the delay and delivery of more materials.\nWhilst not ideal from a waste management perspective, builder feedback to HIA\nindicates there has been considerable effort to ensure more accurate estimating and\ntherefore less waste generation. The advent of pre-fabricated and pre-cut material has\nhelped reduce waste significantly as has the considerable advancements in software\ntechnology which creates more accurate estimation of materials required for a job.\nSmaller builders working with trade contractors to maintain clean sites and minimise\nwaste generation during the build process is on the increase. Advantageous from a\nhealth and safety perspective, there are, however, sometimes difficulties in making\ntrade contractors take ownership of waste. This is particularly evident with the large\namount of work available. Larger builders generally have more influence and better\nsystems in place for regular contractors. For smaller builders it is only when the\nmarket slows and trades become more freely available that behaviour can be more\neasily modified.\nLocal government planning requirements can also promote additional usage and waste\nof materials for builders. For example if planning requirements dictate unusual\nsetbacks and floor coverage, a varied design can create unusual room sizes that differs\nfrom the carefully calculated requirements of a standard design or project home. This\ntends to create a site with higher amount of waste.\nIt is also difficult to ensure compliance with Council local laws. Fines are regularly\nimposed for breaches of the many onerous requirements on small builders, driving up\nthe cost of housing. One example is a (Council) requirement to have skips provided\non sites, rather than the sorting waste on site, in trailers or in cages. While this may\nhave advantages in terms of site appearance and safety, it also has the effect of\nencouraging illegal dumping of non related waste into the skips (and sometimes fines\nfor excess waste that is not the responsibility of the builder). This is a particular\nproblem in established housing areas or partly-developed estates.\nBoth small and large builders face the problems associated with the disposal of\npackaging material from white goods much of which is non recyclable.\nRecycling and reuse of material\nThe low volumes of waste generated by individual builders is of little value and often\nnot able to be economically recycled. There is also a lack of available, co-ordinated", "text_len": 2876, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Both are disincentives\nto recycling for smaller builders.\nThe location of transfer stations, in both urban and regional areas is often\ninconvenient or not readily accessible. The transport of waste to these facilities is\ncostly and time consuming.\nBuilding on small land parcels, particularly on infill sites makes the temporary storage\nof waste, in preparation for collection by a recycler difficult. Adding to this is the fact\nthat collection services are often too expensive for the homeowners or unavailable in\nthe area required.\nLand prices in urban areas are also very high, which discourages the use of storage\nfacilities which were once commonplace so the builder could reuse materials on later\njobs.\nWaste Management and the Volume Builder\nWaste Generation\nOn an individual site basis, larger builders usually generate less volumes of waste\nthan smaller builders. Often co-ordinating multiple projects over large urban or\nregional areas, design processes and estimating due to economies of scale are now\nhighly refined. Use of prefabricated materials also assists in generating less waste.\nAn HIA Volume Builder Member reported that:\n“Prefabricated walls are often used because they ensure a cleaner site and less\nwaste.”\nLarger builders are an easy target for infringement notices in growth areas due to the\nhigh level of building activity undertaken. Accidental incidents, such as the tipping of\na bin and scattering of rubbish through an estate in high winds attract large fines\nwhich are considered in many cases to be unjustified. (due to the unintentional nature\nof the occurance). Local laws impose restrictive practices on construction, and other\nrequirements, (including temporary fencing requirements and use of specific bins)\nwhich also drive up costs and impact on housing affordability.\nOne company reported:\n“The Councils are becoming very litigious in regard to all site practices, parking and\nwaste. The effort to enquire (about) and dispute fines costs time and money. Fines for\nhaving bins two thirds full. Fines together with the increases in diesel and tipping fees\nare causing increasing costs – not all of which can be passed onto the homeowner”.\nThe ability to pass on the costs of council fines is constrained by the fixed contract,\nwhich is usual for a project home. These costs are unable to be built into the contract\nat its inception.", "text_len": 2433, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "39.Submission to the Productivity Commission on Waste Management.pdf", "page_num": 7, "text": "Recycling and Reuse of Material\nMany of the volume builders reported significant effort is being placed on disposing\nof waste materials in the best possible way. The biggest issue is the cost of disposal,\nwhich includes the time and effort to arrange. The lack of access to recycling\ncollection services sometimes limits the outcomes achieved. There are only a few\ncompanies in the marketplace equipped to provide such services.\nIt was reported by a Volume Builder that:\n“Costs of waste (and recycling) services vary greatly from $1500 – 5000. Costs\ninclude tipping fees, bobcat, handling fees and time.”\n“Councils are issuing fines and this is resulting in concern that builders cannot\nstockpile waste, cages must be emptied weekly. As a result wording of trade\ncontractor contracts/ purchase orders now states that an element of the scrap\nmaterial – downpiping, scrap etc must be removed from site by the contractor.\nCollection and Recycling Service Providers\nThere are a small number of providers who are establishing themselves as a “one stop\nshop” collector of builder material for recycling. The traditional waste circle involves\ncontinuous trips for the builder between the site and the tip. Onsite collection services\nensure that this does not need to occur and diverts much of the waste from landfill for\nreuse. One advantage, apart from the recycling benefit, is a set cost per job can be\nmade, including disposal costs, tip fees and council permits - giving some degree of\ncertainty of cost per job.\nThe concept is also appropriate for both small and large builders as they are able to\nstore all of their materials in one location for collection and furthermore it allows\ncollection services to be able to respond to innovative and new recycling technology.\nBut currently, the lack of recycling collection services limits the outcomes able to be\nachieved.\nFrom the service providers’ perspective, there is still a lack of suitable sites where the\ndisposal, sorting and conversion process can occur to convert waste to alternative\nproducts. They ideally require large tracts of land in order to provide their services,\npreferably in a location close to the collection point. For this reason there are only a\nsmall number of companies offering the service and regional areas are not being well\nserviced.\nSmall quantities of a range of materials (as would be generated by smaller builders)\noften makes collection economically unviable. The separation of these materials\nmakes site management difficult due to the extra space required.", "text_len": 2542, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Bricks, tiles, concrete and\nrock are all crushed and returned to site (if crushing cannot occur in built up areas, it\nis conducted offsite), timber is mulched and the remaining materials are all\ntransported off site for separation, sorting and eventual reuse. Metal, plastic\n(including wrapping), paper and plasterboard are all sold on. The main content of the\nremaining 3% is food waste. Composting opportunities are also being explored to deal\nwith this.\nOne medium sized housing company reported to HIA they employ a waste collection\nservice and find it to be cost effective. The known unit cost is advantageous to them\nand whilst recognising that once the waste has left their site they have no way of\nverifying where it goes, the company find that typically 45-49% of their waste is able\nto be recycled thorough this service. (part of the collection service involves reporting\nback).\nRegulation\nThe housing industry does not support regulation relating to waste generation\nmaintaining that with the right incentives the market will develop an appropriate and\ncost effective response.\nThe residential building industry is already highly regulated. Compliance and red\ntape across all areas, including building, planning, environmental and occupational\nhealth and safety regulation together with local Council regulation, fees, levies and\ncharges are overwhelming and individually contribute significantly to the cost of\ndelivering new housing to Australian families. Aggregated, they constrain\nproductivity, inhibit innovation and damage housing affordability.\nRegulation is the lazy option for governments disinterested in participating in a joint\nsolution to a quantifable problem. In essence, regulation is often an admission by\ngovernments that they have been ineffective. Good regulation requires that policy\ninstruments be compatible with economic realities and deliver a net benefit.\nUnfortunately much of the regulatory burden on housing does not necessarily provide\npublic or private benefits.\nRegulatory reform must be part of the Government’s wider micro-economic agenda to\ndevelop a healthy and productive business environment. Government must review\nand remove any regulation which is not efficient in cost-benefit terms.\nCost of Regulation\nFor too long, new regulations have been imposed on unsuspecting homebuyers who\nnow face significant increases in their housing costs as a result of a “creeping”\nregulatory burden.\nRegulations also impose administrative, compliance and production costs (builders\nare forced to routinely change design and construction methods or products in order to", "text_len": 2745, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Multiple and differing regulation generates additional waste and\nsignificant costs. As a result, governments should only regulate where necessary,\nwhere there is a clear net benefit.\nCosts should not be borne disproportionately by individuals or businesses, particularly\nwhere there is a public benefit arising from the imposition. Alternatives should be\nadequately considered, and measures adopted that maximise the net benefit for the\ncommunity without penalising individuals such as first home buyers.\nGovernments are increasingly regulating as a primary response to policy needs,\nirrespective of the economic implications. New regulation has been introduced on the\nbasis of what may be perceived to be ‘good ideas’ or administrative convenience with\nlittle consideration of net benefit.\nWhere regulation is proposed it should encompass:\n• Identification of the problem – evidence, extent, social and economic cost\n• Clear identification of the objectives\n• Full consideration of the alternatives before regulation (should be least net\ncost or maximum net benefit)\n• Cost benefit analysis – no disproportionate burden should be placed on\nindividuals or business\n• Application of alternatives – non regulatory solutions should be fully explored\n• Minimum necessary regulation to achieve policy objectives\nBut principle deficiencies of building regulation in recent times have been the lack of\nconsideration of net benefit, an apparent disregard for who bears the cost, poor\nproblem identification and lack of access to relevant data, no real consideration of\nnon-regulatory alternatives and inadequate lead-in times for industry to familiarise\nitself with the practical detail of regulation impacting on design and construction.\nNational Competition Policy dictates that unless it can be demonstrated that a net\nbenefit arises from regulation and there are no other alternatives of achieving the\nsame end, then that regulation should be repealed.\nGovernments usually intervene in markets where there is market failure. In the\nhousing sector, Governments have long had a role in regulating construction, issues of\nhealth, safety and amenity and in maintaining a watch dog role through the various\nconsumer affairs and fair trading portfolios.\nWhile there may be reasonable argument for regulating minimum construction\nrequirements through the Building Code of Australia on the basis of safety and\namenity, the arguments for government intervention in the relationship between the\nhousing industry and its clients is less clear.
