These\nmodules are typically designed to fit together seamlessly to form a complete structure, such as a home\nor commercial building. The use of secondary materials in modular construction is a sustainable\nstrategy to enhance products with recycled content (PwRC) uptake in the building and construction\nsector. The factory setting allows for greater exploration and application of eco-friendly materials,\nwhich may be challenging to implement in conventional construction environments. This report\nprovides the findings of a literature review and a case study (ATCO Structures and Logistics) that\nprovides insight into the use of PwRC in modular construction.\nFirst, the research team conducted an extensive literature review to highlight the status of modular\nconstruction uptake in Australia (Section 3.1) and explore the main drivers (Section 3.2) and challenges\n3.2(Section 3.3) to enhance its uptake in the Australian context. This review also identified the major\nenvironmental and economic benefits of using PwRC in modular construction in Australia (Sections 3.4\nand 3.5).\nSecond, the findings from the case study analysis, which was based on a series of interviews with the\nsix key stakeholders involved in various activities related to modular construction, are presented. The\naim of this case study was to understand the main challenges, motivations, strategies and benefits of\nPwRC utilisation in modular construction. The results showed that there are 16 categories of challenges\nthat hinder the application of PwRC in modular construction. These categories include a broad range\nof issues, including supply chain, cost, organisational limitations and technical complexities. The\nanalysis of motivations revealed that ‘supportive organisational targets’, ‘financial benefits’, ‘client\npreference and obligations’, ‘securing public projects’ and ’moral obligations’ can drive the use of these\nresources in modular construction. The interviews also revealed that ten strategies could further\nenhance the adoption of PwRC in modular construction.\nLastly, according to the research findings, this report provides a framework developed to guide efforts\nin enhancing the uptake of PwRC in modular construction. This framework consists of four components\nthat propose strategies to enhance organisational capacity, supply chain performance and recycled\nproduct quality as well as policies that can support this transformation across the first three\ncomponents.", "text_len": 2668, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

These\nmodules are typically designed to fit together seamlessly to form a complete structure, such as a home\nor commercial building. Modular construction comes in several forms. It can be delivered “as a box” in\nfinished form, as a flat pack – separate parts such as wall frames and floor panels – or as a kit of smaller\ncomponents.\nPrefabrication is revolutionising the construction sector at every level by bridging construction and\nmanufacturing. This concept is encapsulated in the definition of industrialised construction, which\ninvolves the prefabrication, modularisation, and standardisation of construction processes and assets\nin controlled factory environments1.\nModular construction has the potential to also transform project management for construction firms,\nwith onsite construction projects completed in as little as 12 weeks instead of the traditional 12-month\ntimeline. Additionally, modular design enhances their ability to handle multiple projects\nsimultaneously without compromising quality or risking damage to their reputation. The use of\nmodular construction provides several benefits as outlined in Table 1. These advantages encompass\nsocial, environmental, and economic aspects, offering a more sustainable construction approach\noverall.\nIn modular construction, bulk material orders allow manufacturers to fabricate multiple modules\nsimultaneously, leading to lower prices from suppliers and reduced labour and transportation needs.\nThis results in cost and time savings for the project. Additionally, prefabricated construction reduces\nthe on-site labour force, lowering total labour costs by approximately 25% compared to traditional\nmethods; this is specifically evidenced when labour force has to be deployed in regional areas. It is well\ndocumented that when construction phase activities overlap with prefabricated construction, there is\na reduction in construction time of approximately 40% compared to traditional construction methods2.\nOne study focused on dwellings only, indicates that modular construction can cut construction times\nby as much as 50% and reduce costs by up to 20%3. Another analysis estimates claimed offsite\nconstruction is three times more productive than onsite1.\nAnother key benefit is the immunity to weather disruptions, allowing for year-round production and\nthe potential for multiple shifts, leading to optimal utilisation of plant and equipment. This high\nutilisation rate helps justify investments in new modular technologies. Furthermore, the controlled\nfactory environment enhances safety, resulting in fewer days lost to injuries compared to onsite\nconstruction. Offsite construction also enables concurrent work processes, such as foundation and wall\nconstruction, which can then be integrated onsite. Additionally, the use of digital technologies is more\nextensive in a factory setting, providing greater precision in cost estimation and delivery times. Process\ncontrol technologies and automation reduce time and waste, leading to fewer defects and the need\nfor rework4. In terms of construction work safety, the adoption of this technology can provide a safer\nworking environment which can result in the reduction of safety incidents by up to 80%5.\nThis type of construction also offers environmental advantages, including decreased construction\nwaste and CO emissions, as well as reduced disturbance to neighbouring sites by minimising on-site\n2\nnoise and dust pollution.

This section of the\nreport reviews these benefits in light of the use of PwRC and waste minimisation during their\napplication.\n3.1 Modular construction in Australia: An overview\nAll modern methods of construction (MMC) approaches particularly modular construction are\nexperiencing a surge in popularity in Australia due to recognised value as an efficient construction\nmethod. As outlined before, this approach reduces overall construction costs, saves time, and\nencourages innovation.\nWith less than 5% of the total construction, the adoption of modular construction in Australia lags\nbehind that of many other advanced economies4, such as Scandinavian countries, Japan, Singapore\nand Germany. The PrefabAus industry roadmap report indicates that by 2025, this figure will reach\n15%. While modular design may not be the perfect solution to address all the challenges in the\nAustralian housing market, it does represent an initial step toward a fairer housing solution. One may\nconsider the potential of high-quality buildings that can be disassembled, moved, and updated easily\nin a community that greatly needs more affordable housing options8. Furthermore, Australia boasts\nthe largest average home size globally. However, modular housing, akin to the tiny homes’ movement,\npromotes the idea of living with a smaller footprint.\nThe public sector's capital expenditure is expected to increase by 2.8% in 2023-24, leading to a rise in\ndemand for prefabricated building products such as sheds, industrial facilities, and temporary\nwarehouses. This growth is driven by major infrastructure projects like the Western Sydney\nInfrastructure Plan, Perth's METRONET expansion, and the Victorian Government's Metro9. Federal\nand State governments across the nation are increasingly showing significant interest in modular\nconstruction. For instance, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) requires the use of\nmodular building solutions for replacing assets in the Pacific Islands, as well as for critical consular and\ndiplomatic facilities. Acknowledging the security benefits of offsite construction, the Australian\nmodular construction industry has supplied the majority of construction needs for the Australian\nDefence Forces over the past decade4.\nAt the state level, Queensland is committed to extending its apprentice-led QBuild program, producing\nprefabricated homes in a Brisbane factory. Australian prefabrication supplies 80% of the build for the\n2032 Queensland Olympic Games athletes’ village. Correctional Services NSW has pledged to boost\nthe production of modular homes by June 2025, aiming to enhance the supply of Indigenous housing.\nMeanwhile, in Victoria, the state government has started providing modular housing to individuals at\nrisk of homelessness4. The major external industries and sectors that influence the performance of\nthe modular construction industry in Australia include mining, public infrastructure construction,\nprivate residential construction, agriculture, and institutional building construction.\n8 Latham, D (2024) The future is prefabricated: Prefabrication and modular construction Dane Latham.

Major industries and sectors influencing modular construction and the relevant product\nexamples\nReports9 suggest a positive growth in demand from institutional building construction, public\ninfrastructure construction, and mining sectors in 2023-24. However, a decline is expected in private\nresidential construction and agriculture sectors.\nPrefabAUS4 estimates indicate that the Australian modular construction industry has the potential to\nyield annual benefits of $9 billion. This estimation is based on the assumption of a 20% cost saving and\nthe nation achieving a 30% share of modular construction in the construction market by 2033.\nAccording to a recent report by IBISWorld9, the prefabricated metal building manufacturing industry is\nprojected to experience an annual revenue growth rate of 1.7% over the five years through 2028-29,\nreaching $3.0 billion.\nWhen it comes to support for the Australian modular construction industry, two key factors stand out.\nThe industry benefits from free trade agreements with China, Vietnam, and New Zealand. These\nagreements exempt prefabricated metal building products from the general tariff of 5.0%, making\nexports to these markets easier. Over the past five years, these trade deals have helped industry\nexporters expand their access to international customers. Additionally, manufacturers are protected\nby anti-dumping laws, ensuring fair competition and safeguarding against unfair trading practices.\nPrefabAUS is an industry association dedicated to promoting and supporting the use of prefabricated\nconstruction methods to enhance construction efficiency, sustainability, and affordability. The\norganization serves as a bridge between manufacturers and government agencies, advocating for the\nsector's interests and needs. Through collaboration with relevant bodies, PrefabAUS plays a crucial\nrole in influencing policies, regulations, and standards affecting the modular building sector.\n3.2 Drivers of adopting modular construction in the residential sector\nThe application of this construction methodology in Australia is driven by five major factors ( Figure 2).\nModular housing in Australia has been advocated as both an immediate response to accommodate\nthose who are affected by natural disasters (short term), and a rapid method to deliver permanent\nresidences, aiming to alleviate the nation’s housing shortage (long-term) and a solution to the limited\nsupply of construction labour (medium-term)4. Recently, modular housing has been used as an\nefficient solution for flood relief in the Northern Rivers of NSW and central west towns such as\nEugowra.", "text_len": 2624, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The main drivers for using modular construction in Australia\nIn Australia, limited construction skilled labour presents an opportunity and incentive to quickly scale\nup the prefabrication industry for success in the residential sector. Furthermore, Australia is known for\npaying some of the highest construction labour wages globally. Factors contributing to this include\nAustralia's high cost of living, strong labour unions, stringent workplace health and safety regulations,\nand the nation's resource-rich economy, which drives up wages in industries like construction.\nThe majority of Australian builders are small businesses with one or two people, relying heavily on\nsubcontracted and agency labour for various stages of building projects. A recent report published by\nIBISWorld10 indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted supply chains for building\nmaterials, fuel, capital equipment and skilled labour; delaying building progress and escalating input\nprices and wage rates in Australia. The use of modular construction can compensate for the skilled\nlabour shortage as it provides higher rates of construction productivity. Since unmet housing demand\nand the relative scarcity and cost of construction labour are the major predictors of where modular\nconstruction can gain traction, a report by McKinsey & Company3 showed where these two factors\nintersect as depicted in Figure 3. This report highlights the potential growth in markets such as\nAustralia, the UK, Singapore, and the US regional.\nFigure 3.

There is limited knowledge of modular construction applicability nationwide. The industry\nmodel in Australia is primarily focused on basic and remote housing, with prefabrication largely limited\nto the basic definition of offsite production. However, the industry has yet to fully embrace new\nprocesses and models on a larger scale. In many cases, Australian prefabrication simply transfers\ntraditional construction methods to a factory setting4. This is of particular importance, as the scale is\nneeded to justify investment across off-site construction manufacturing and application.

The initial investment is required\nto set up the infrastructure, equipment, and processes necessary for efficient and effective production\nof modular components. As outlined before, the pandemic-related disruptions have added to the\ncomplexity and contributed to higher setup costs. This together with the uncertainties about the return\non investment (ROI) in the industry has made setting up modular construction facilities more\nchallenging and costly, posing a major hurdle for the industry in Australia.\nThe complexity of using modular construction as a disaster relief solution is intertwined with\ngovernment initiatives. In a recent article published in the Gurdian12, three major barriers to the\napplication of modular construction as a disaster relief solution were reported to be the lack of\ncommunity consultation, small funding pools for buyback initiatives, and inefficient rollouts. According\nto the reports11, the buyback initiatives in Australia may not offer property buybacks at pre-disaster\nvalues for all disaster-affected communities. Having access to this fund would have been beneficial for\nthese communities to raise their homes, especially those considering modular construction as a quick\naccommodation solution. The issue with inefficient rollouts in natural disaster-affected areas is linked\nto the delays in providing modular temporary housing solutions, ineffective construction site\npreparation and poor communications with the stakeholders12.\n11 Rose, T (2023) Buyback offers to reach 1,100 northern NSW homeowners, 500 fewer than hoped by agency boss.

The first environmental benefit of this approach is carbon emission savings.\nCarbon savings primarily result from the reduced consumption of natural resources in the building and\nconstruction sector due to the utilisation of PwRC. Carbon emission saving can be estimated using a\nrange of available metrics including global warming potential (measured in t CO eq)13. The findings of\n2\nan empirical research study14 indicate that modular construction reduces embodied energy by 56%\nand 26% in small and large structures, respectively. Technically, this can offset the additional carbon\nemissions arising from waste recycling, thus improving the environmental performance of PwRC.\nFigure 5. The major environmental benefits of using PwRC in modular construction\nThe use of secondary materials in modular construction occurs in two different forms: recycled\nmaterials and nonrecycled materials. A research study in Australia13 showed that reusing waste non-\nrecycled resources has a superior carbon footprint than recycled materials. This is because some PwRC\nare invariably wasted or contaminated in the process, and the recycling process requires energy\nconsumption. In some cases, construction and demolition waste from a site can be reused in the new\nconstruction, reducing the necessity to transport these materials to and from recycling facilities. A\nstudy conducted in Australia15 indicated that reusing demolition waste in the new construction on the\nsame site has resulted in 1,000 fewer truck movements, 9,000 L of diesel saved, and therefore, 663 t\nof CO were avoided. The study found that the carbon emission reductions were achieved in three key\n2\nareas: onsite, through the replacement of raw materials with recovered demolition products; offsite,\nthrough recycling; and during transport, through reduced truck movements.\nThe second benefit is related to reduced waste disposal from demolition activities. Modular designs\nenable not only offsite construction but offsite demolition as well. A University of Melbourne's Centre\nfor Advanced Manufacturing of Prefabricated Housing report16 suggests that all components of\nmodular construction can be reused, thus eliminating the waste that would typically end up in landfills.\nThe third advantage focuses on minimizing the risk of waste resource contamination at the end of their\nservice life. Modular constructions are usually designed for easy disassembly, reducing the\n13 Minunno, R., O'Grady, T., Morrison, G. M. and Gruner, R. L.

Additionally, modular construction processes reduce the impact of potentially\nenvironmentally hazardous waste materials, which are more challenging to manage compared to non-\nhazardous construction and demolition waste materials.\nThe fourth advantage of using PwRC in modular construction is the reduction of noise pollution. In the\nenvironmentally controlled setting of an off-site factory, the process of repurposing and applying\nresultant PwRC in prefabricated building elements can be completed with minimal environmental\nnoise. This is in contrast to on-site construction, where the use of materials and construction methods\ncan lead to significant noise disturbances for nearby residents and businesses. By conducting these\nprocesses in a controlled factory environment, noise pollution can be greatly reduced, contributing to\nthe sustainable application of these PwRC.\nThe last environmental advantage of this application is the reduced impacts on the ecology. Since the\nmajority of application of PwRC in a modular approach takes place off-site, it significantly diminishes\nthe ecological impact including reduced soil erosion and less harm to the local ecosystem.\n3.5 Economic benefits of using PwRC in modular construction\nThe use of PwRC in modular construction can provide multiple economic benefits (Figure 6). The first\nbenefit is the decreased requirement for rework caused by building defects. Off-site construction\nallows for the highest quality of construction, leading to enhanced implementation of PwRC with\nminimal waste from defects during both construction and operation. This results in cost savings for\nconstructors and building owners by avoiding the costs associated with rework. Moreover, when\nconstructed to withstand earthquakes and high wind loads, they often outperform conventional\nstructures designed to resist these forces2. This advantage can reduce externally induced defects in\nprefabricated components that incorporate PwRC.\nFigure 6. The major economic benefits of using PwRC in modular construction\nThe second benefit involves extending the PwRC lifecycle. Although an increasing portion of modular\nconstruction focuses on permanent structures (similar to conventional buildings), many businesses\ncontinue to utilise modular buildings for temporary purposes. Relocatable buildings are brought to\nsites for rapid expansion or as temporary facilities for students, patients, or employees during\nrenovations or emergencies. Once the additional space is no longer required, the modular building is\ntaken off-site and repurposed for future use. This indicates that PwRC can continue to function as a\nconstruction material, reducing the need for demolition and greatly enhancing its circularity.\nThe third benefit is in connection with a more standardised (industrialised) approach to using PwRC\nreduces the complexity of utilising these waste-based resources. This streamlined approach enhances\ntheir application, leading to significant cost savings.

This enables any PwRC\nleftover resources from one project to be used in subsequent modules, enhancing their utilization\nefficiency, especially during supply shortages. Moreover, with the increasing interest in prefabricated\nbuildings, the use of PwRC in this industry can tap into a new and sustainable market. This, in turn,\nfosters an economy of scale that ultimately enhances the economic competitiveness of PwRC.\nThe fourth benefit focuses on the application of a wider range of PwRC in an industrialised\nenvironment. Constructors can explore innovative ways to incorporate various PwRC that may not be\nfeasible in onsite construction due to constraints such as time and space limitations or safety\nrequirements. The increased demand for a wider range of PwRC can attract investment in advanced\nrepurposing technologies and the development of new supply chains. This, in turn, can lead to a\nreduction in the production cost of these resources.\nThe last benefit involves capacity building within the modular construction industry and organisations\nto enhance their environmental sustainability and showcase it effectively. In many countries, including\nAustralia, environmental sustainability initiatives such as Zero Waste movements urge the government\nand the industry to take a more circular approach. This is now clearly reflected in the decision-making\nprocesses of organisations involved in the building and construction sector. In such scenarios, these\norganisations are incentivised to utilise PwRC to showcase their sustainable practices in business\noperations17 and to be recognised by various environmental sustainability rating schemes18. This will\nincrease the likelihood of securing additional construction contracts that prioritise environmental\nsustainability. In a recent study conducted in Australia15, the research participants indicated that the\nneed for organisations to ensure competitive advantage and future-proofing was identified as the\nsecond main motivation for using PwRC in construction projects.\n17 Shooshtarian S, Maqsood T, Wong PSP and Bettini L (2022) 'Application of sustainable procurement policy to improve the circularity of\nconstruction and demolition waste resources in Australia'.

It begins by detailing the organisation's strategies for managing\nC&D waste resources, followed by an overview of their initiatives for reusing modular products and\nprocuring PwRC for new construction and retrofitting projects. Additionally, the contributions of each\nparticipant involved in these activities are highlighted where applicable. While some participants were\ndirectly involved in the procurement process, others were not, resulting in varying levels of\nunderstanding of the organization's procurement procedures among different participants.\nTypically, the off-cuts and waste materials generated during the manufacturing and installation of\nmodular buildings are disposed of in recycling bins. These waste resources are managed through three\npotential pathways: 1. Collection by third-party waste operators, 2. Reuse in the production of new\nbuilding products or applications in the retrofitting projects, or 3. Disposal in landfills. To minimise\nwaste generation, the organisation set a criterion for material procurement focusing on the ‘packaging\nmaterials’ issues. C P reported that in some cases, the organisation negotiates with the supplier to\n1 1\nreduce packaging waste materials. However, in most cases, the off-cuts and other waste materials are\ndumped into recycling bins, where, as outlined above, they might be reused in ACTO S&L products. An\nexample of this reuse is for framed decks,\n‘Framed decks are typically lined with a structural ply lining on top...we may find that that\nstructural ply is kind of weathered. So we will take that part off the deck…But we will reuse\nthe deck frame, and reline it so that we don't have to continually go and get more steel\nframing built for our jobs.

Overall, despite having slightly different procurement criteria, the\nPwRC procurement model is not different from other alternatives (C P ), and their utilisation is to a\n1 5\nlimited extent as indicated by C P ,\n1 3\n‘The process of procuring waste materials, it would be no different to procuring any\nmaterial’ [C P ].\n1 5\n‘We don't tend to use a lot of recycled products if I'm being honest. When we do it, it would\nusually be in line with the tender requirements…occasionally we use recycled decking\nproducts and decking boards. That's about it.’ [C P ].\n1 3\nAccording to the interviews, there are several factors influencing the procurement of PwRC in ATCO\nS&L products. These factors are listed in Sections 5.5-5.7. It also appears that there are currently no\nspecific criteria established for the procurement of PwRC. However, the most commonly cited criteria\nfor PwRC procurement include cost, availability, associated risk, and suitability. C P reported that\n1 2\n‘It's still more like in a pipeline to look at those recycled materials, but again it all comes\ndown to what's the cost involved in those materials, the availability of those materials and\nif there's any risk’ [C P ].\n1 2\nIn ATCO S&L, generally, the design team specifies the construction materials based on the individual\ndesigns, which will be passed on to the manufacturing sector to procure. For the procurement of PwRC,\nthese are suppliers that reach out to the organisation to sell their products. They share their products’\nspecifications with the organisation (i.e. compliance team) to review them for fit for purposes point of\nview of the organisation.\n‘There are some products that now we've been introducing, that we’re investigating to use\nas we can see a lot a few of, a couple of sales reps from different recycling companies,\nthey're start coming into the business and introduce the product’ [C P ].\n1 2\nMost products are supplied through shorter supply chains with whom ATCO S&L established business\narrangements. For instance, C P , the supplying organisation representative, indicated that they supply\n1 6\nsteel construction products/materials, some with a high level of recycled content to ATCO S&L. These\nmaterials include smaller angles channels, flats and other hot rolled sections (Table 4). The participant\nalso commented on the upstream material supply chain.

Waste disposal diversion results in improved economic and\nenvironmental sustainability in the sector.\n‘Where we're using recycled products is a great thing because it's reducing landfill, it's\nreducing microplastics in the ocean’ [C P ]\n1 5\n‘Diversion of waste away from a waste stream back into a recycling stream’ [C P ]\n1 6\n3) Alignment with the circular economy concept\nWithin the circular economy concept, the use of PwRC is emphasised as a key strategy to maintain the\nvalue of materials in the economy for as long as possible. According to C P , utilising locally sourced\n1 1\nPwRC can further enhance the sector's circularity by reducing the need for transportation and energy\nconsumption.\n‘If the market makes that circle of the circular economy as small as possible, rather than\nsending, your waste all the way to either China or India or somewhere in Europe or North\nAmerica to then, be recycled there and probably reused there’. [C P ]\n1 1\n‘That's [using recycled products] the idea of how you can do more with less. The idea of\ngenerating less waste is important, but use less to, use less energy, generate fewer\nemissions, increased circularity, increasing material efficiency’ [C P ]\n1 6\n4) Longer life span of PwRC\nOne participant indicated that some PwRCs have better durability compared to products created from\nvirgin materials. According to C P , This in the long run can provide an economic advantage for the\n1 4\nmanufacturer of modular products.\n‘A lot of these recycled products have a longer life span than the other ones. So whilst they\nmay be a higher initial investment, they certainly provide better economical advantages\nover the long term’ [C P ]\n1 4\n5) Material cost balance\nAs the consumption of natural resources continues to rise across various industries and for a range of\nproducts, their prices will likely increase. Additionally, in certain applications, the use of PwRC may not\nbe technically feasible, leading to intense competition for virgin materials. Therefore, in the future,\nincorporating PwRC in modular construction could play a significant role in enhancing the economic\nsustainability of the building and construction sector.\n‘If we're not using recycled products, the cost of a raw product style material will start to\noutweigh the cost of recycled material because there's less and less of it’ [C P ]\n1 5", "text_len": 3070, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Therefore, it is prudent to begin adopting PwRC, which will, in turn, help establish\nan effective supply chain for these products. Working with an established supply chain will enhance\nthe economic sustainability of the modular manufacturing industry. C P indicated that the earlier\n1 5\ndevelopment of such supply chains is a key to success in this space.\n‘So I think from an economic point of view, the earlier you move into that, the earlier you secure\nsupply chain, the earlier you build those relationships, it's going to be better for you when that\ncost economy starts to change’ [C P ]\n1 5\n7) Enterprise sustainability image improvement\nThe use of PwRC can enhance the enterprise's social image of businesses operating within the building\nand construction sector. In the current climate, where the sector faces severe criticism for\nunsustainable practices, the application of these products not only supports social sustainability but,\naccording to C P , can also offer economic advantages by partnering with organisations that either\n1 4\nfund sustainability-focused projects or seek to market themselves as sustainable businesses.\n‘I guess that it comes down to ATCO’s place in the world and ATCO being seen to be using\nrecycled materials and being seen to be green and reducing your carbon footprint’. [C P ]\n1 3\n‘but one of our competitors was openly promoting themselves and demonstrating that\nthey were using recycled steel … And then you've got a big, $500 million project that's\nbeing funded by the federal government, managed by a tier one company, which tier one\ncompany is going to go with ATCO over the competitor that's marketing themselves and\nhas that positive social influence?’ [C P ]\n1 5\n8) Responding to the society's sustainability concerns\nSocieties worldwide, especially in developed nations, have gained greater awareness of environmental\nsustainability. As a result, there has been a significant increase in demand for sustainable practices and\npolicies in different industries and sectors over the recent years. The use of PwRC can contribute to\nthe overall sustainability of the sector, effectively addressing this growing demand.\n‘We can see socially that society is pushing more and more and more for sustainability.\nThey want green energy; they want less products and pollution. They want the\nelectrification of the grid. They want to know that the people that they're getting things\nfrom are having the least amount of impact on the Earth for their future generations and\nfor their own health. So, I think from a primary social area, it really comes down to how\nyou market yourself and remain at the forefront of people's minds that are potentially\nbuying your products’ [C P ]\n1 5\n9) A learning experience for young people\nAccording to two participants (C P and C P ), using PwRC in modular products, especially those used\n1 1 1 2\nin educational settings, can offer valuable learning opportunities for young people. This exposure\nallows them to understand the application of these products in buildings and similar modular\nstructures, fostering a mindset aligned with sustainability principles. Consequently, this can further\nenhance the social sustainability of the sector.", "text_len": 3562, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

It's all about that, helping the environment and things like that’ [C P ]\n1 2\n10) Employment opportunities\nThe process of converting waste materials into products often involves several steps that are labour-\nintensive, creating employment opportunities compared to waste landfilling. Therefore, it can be\nconcluded that utilising PwRC in modular construction offers significant benefits for social\nsustainability through triggering waste recovery activities that employment associated with them.\n‘It provides an economic return to those who return it to us as recyclers, the demolition\ncompanies, the manufacturers or, you know,…there's a social impact around that from an\nemployment point of view’ [C P ]\n1 6\n5.4 Challenges of using PwRC in modular construction\nThe number of challenges identified as hindering the application of PwRC in the modular construction\nsector far exceeded our expectations. After consolidating some challenge categories, 16 categories\nemerged. These categories include a broad range of issues, including supply chain, cost, organisational\nlimitations and technical complexities.Figure 10 illustrates these ten categories. The most commonly\nmentioned challenge category among these is ‘cost complexities’ followed by the ‘industry\nconservative approach’ and ‘availability of PwRC’.\nThe following sections provide insights into the industry perceptions regarding these challenge\ncategories; they are presented in no specific order.

{"source_file": "75.Case-Study-1-1-ATCO-SL.pdf", "page_num": 31, "text": "1) Project characteristics\nThe quality and quantity of PwRC utilisation in construction projects depend on various factors related\nto the project's nature, including both physical and non-physical aspects. These factors can hinder or\ncomplicate the use of PwRC in construction projects. As outlined by C P , these factors can include the\n1 4\nbuilding's age, the project's size, and the allocated budget.\n‘So we have buildings that are two months old and we have buildings that are 20 years\nold. And obviously, the specification between those two buildings varies a lot’. [C P ]\n1 4\n‘But we can’t really, on bigger jobs, it's harder for us to use those [PwRC] because our\nclients will go, “Well, hold on a second, this is a three-and-a-half million dollar job, why\nhave I got second-hand materials here? What's this doing here? What's that doing here?’\n[C P ]\n1 4\n‘Whether they've got a tight budget or a loose budget, whatever that may be…whether\ntheir project can allow for it that will determine whether they can take it or not’ [C P ]\n1 4\n2) Cost complexities\nThe issue of cost complexities was cited by several research participants. This issue has three\ndimensions and can be divided into three subcategories based on the interviewees' responses: 1) The\nhigher cost of PwRC compared to conventional materials, 2) Market interventions by competitors\nagainst PwRC supply, and 3) The client's willingness to pay extra for PwRC.\n‘In order to be marketable it would then have to have all of that testing, and when you\namortise all of that testing into a product, becomes more expensive, particularly when\nyou're trying to introduce it into a new market’ [C P ]\n1 1\n‘The exciting and the funny side of this is that you know, everyone's supposed to be\nrecycled should be cheaper. But it's vice versa, right? When it comes to recycling the cost\nof the materials it's almost double the cost of the original, it's not that cheap [C P ]\n1 2\n‘Generally, it's, it tends to be those recycled products are generally more expensive than\nstandard, say timber products, particularly with decking boards’ [C P ]\n1 3\n‘If sustainability is number 1, then yeah, we're looking great. However, if the price is\nnumber 1, then those options can look quite expensive in the short term’ [C P ]\n1 4\n‘There is an element of cost competitiveness and I think that relates to a lot more to new\nproduct in the market versus established players, particularly when there might possibly\nbe a premium being paid because of the lack of competition, which when competition\ncomes in business…I'll say that business readjusts itself to suit the market, to maybe make\nit harder for a new entry to come into that market as well’ [C P ]\n1 1\n‘So there's the initial upfront capital cost interrogation of product for product comparison.\nThen there's the life of asset cost incorporating maintenance and replacement over a 15\nor 20 year product life cycle’ [C P ]\n1 5\n‘Five, six, seven years ago, there used to be a push for air conditioners to have a certain\nstar rating, for example, for their sustainability. Now, we would have to charge them to\nput new air conditioners into buildings so that they have that star rating and as soon as\nthey saw the price of that, the answer was always, well, no, don't worry about it’ [C P ]\n1 4\n3) Industry conservative approach\nThe building and construction sector is often viewed as resistant to innovation and change, with a\nstrong aversion to the risks that come with any change. The industry's supply chain processes have\nbeen evolved over decades, and any request for change is seen as disruptive, leading to various\ncomplications. This resistance is especially evident among senior managers, who tend to rely on", "text_len": 3713, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Below are\n1 1\nsome comments from participants on this issue:\n‘The construction industry, by its nature, is very conservative. But, like I said, a lot of things\nthat are based on, “It worked last time. I will do it again”… But I think it's a lack of\nimagination, is probably another way of looking at it and using a conservative,\nconservatism in the way of ignorance’ [C P ]\n1 1\n‘But when it comes to the modular industry, I would say 90% of the buildings, that use in\nthe modular industry are they all using James Hardie products, for instance, or Colour, or\nColourbond metal cladding’ [C P ]\n1 2\n‘Senior business managers in the larger modular firms, have spent most of their career in\nthose businesses, so they're so comfortable and familiar with what they've done and their\nsupply chain… Habitual mentality of, “We've always used this product. We're comfortable\nwith this product. We know this product. We know this supplier’[C P ]\n1 5\n4) Greenwashing and product misrepresentation\nThis category refers to a well-established concept in the recycling practice and research. It is the\npractice of misleading end users by falsely claiming or exaggerating the environmental benefits or\nrecycled content of a product. One participant (C P ) suggested that greenwashed products could pose\n1 1\na challenge to the seamless acceptance of PwRC in the sector.\n‘There are some that have been green-washed and placed into the market as well…[they]\nare sold as green that essentially aren't, and they're still charging a premium or the selling\na product that is not necessarily fit for purpose in terms of its longevity or application in\nour particular builds’ [C P ]\n1 1\n‘They all currently have drawbacks in either their credentials as being completely recycled\nmaterial. Having recently done some testing on some materials where they say, “Oh, it\nwas made from this and this”, and so due diligence and only a few hundred dollars later, I\ncan get a test done and have it put to them that it's actually not what you say it is. So you\nactually misrepresenting your product’ [C P ]\n1 1\n5) Limited availability of PwRC and an immature supply chain\nThe limited availability of PwRC was a concern raised by three participants, who highlighted its\nsignificance given the volume and industrialised nature of modular construction. They pointed out that\nin modular construction the components must be readily available and supplied to manufacturing sites\non time to prevent any disruption to the sequential production processes. One participant (C P )\n1 1\nhighlighted that the availability of some PwRC is constrained by the comparatively small and immature\nsupply chain operating in Australia, which serves a market of 25 million people. Below are some\nresponses from the participants:\n‘An Australian supply chain that is only supplying a population of 25, 26 million people. So\nthere's certain products that I know that are available elsewhere that are not available in\nAustralia and there's barriers to entry for that as well … Some of the fire-rated products,\nsome of the fire-rated board materials and stuff like that, readily available in the UK and\nEurope and […] in North America’ [C P ]\n1 1\n‘But again it's [PwRC application] all come down to what's the cost involved into those\nmaterials and the availability of those materials and if there's any risk’ [C P ]\n1 2\n‘Procurement and availability is a big one generally, we have tight timeframes when we\nmanufacture, generally.

These targets provide a structured approach to incorporating\nPwRC, aligning organisational practices with broader environmental goals. The lack of established\ntargets for using these resources can reduce the motivation, accountability, and innovation needed to\neffectively incorporate them into construction projects.\nThe findings from the interviews indicate that, at present, there are no targets for using PwRC in\nmodular construction within the study organisation, nor is there any policy in place to encourage their\nuse. Some relevant responses are provided below:\nBut at this point, we're not yet into that area. We're not yet sure, we're still in like the\nreviewing process stage of those products and like assessment, but it hasn't been making\nup a firm call on those alternative reusable materials. [C P ]\n1 2\nWe don't tend to use a lot of recycled products if I'm being honest. Then, when we do, it\nwould usually be in line with the tender requirements [C P ]\n1 3\n‘We might be procuring something that has raw waste blended into it. But that's the same\nthing, we're not necessarily looking or setting expectations to our suppliers that, “Hey,\nwe're going to procure this, and we want it to have at least 5% blended waste product in\nit because it's a society, a sustainability initiative”. We haven't got to that point’ [C P ]\n1 5\n‘I guess the government is all about being green as well…[but] they don't currently have\nany policy around using recycled material, they don't tend to’ [C P ]\n1 3\n‘In regional areas or lower tier builders who don't have those things [obligatory\nincorporation of recycled content] commercially put into their deals, you know, they don't\nneed to get recycled product. It's not mandated for them to do that. Therefore, they are\noften the smaller builders who will take the cheaper option’ [C P ]\n1 4\n7) Lack of precedent in PwRC application\nOne participant observed that the modular construction industry tends to be cautious about using\nproducts that lack market testing. Demonstrated performance from previous use can build market\nconfidence and foster wider adoption of these products. C P noted that while laboratory tests are a\n1 2\nuseful way to understand the nature of a product, they do not equate to assessing its actual utilisation\nand performance in modular components.\n‘It's more like a salesperson walking in, “Hey, we've got this recycle substrate board”,\nright? It hasn't been tested on the market and it's more like they want us to have a look at\nthat. So we're kind of looking to other what other competitors are doing at the moment\nwhere the other competitors are’ [C P ]\n1 2\n‘Like I said, it's been tested in the laboratory, but when it comes to if it’s in construction\nitself, it hasn't been tested in that area’ [C P ]\n1 2", "text_len": 3506, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

But then when\nwe use those recycled materials in apartments, they can catch fire and it's the problem is\nthat there are a lot of other companies that produce equivalent to those materials’ [C P ]\n1 3\n8) Health and safety issues\nThe use of PwRC presents health and safety complications. Physical and chemical changes during\nrecycling processes can cause the industry to be cautious about using recycled materials due to\npotential health and safety issues. C P highlighted that it is not advisable to use PwRC which lacks\n1 2\naccompanying safety data.\n‘One of the issues that come from potentially looking at recyclable materials can come\nfrom, how good the data is around the safety of that product, and therefore the\nunderstanding and interpretation of potential controls or exposure for the workers. But do\nwe know if it's safe to use when we're cutting it and sending it? Heating it? Glueing it, etc.?\nWashing it? That probably provides a little bit of fear response, which prevents them from\nlooking at that space at the moment’ [C P ]\n1 5\n9) Lack of certification for recycled products\nAs indicated in the previous category, the unknown nature of recycled materials can hinder their\nwidespread application in modular construction. The lack of a formal assessment of PwRC\nperformance, safety and quality can lead to uncertainty and reluctance in their adoption, as\nstakeholders may have insufficient information to evaluate their suitability and reliability for\nconstruction projects.\n‘Only a few hundred dollars later, I can get a test done and have it put to them [material\nsupplier] that it's actually not what you say it is’ [C P ]\n1 1\n‘The problem is that there are a lot of other companies that produce equivalent to those\nmaterials but haven't been tested or going through the process of assessing the nature of\nthose products. And that's why we have the issue in the industry of materials that get\ncaught in a fire and there was no proper certification’ [C P ]\n1 2\n‘…but what about the safety data sheet? What about the health?” and the person that\nwas providing it to us didn't have the greatest knowledge yet… So, because those things\nweren't answerable, we had to say, well, we can't use the product, but to me it looked like\na great product’ [C P ]\n1 5\n10) PwRC longevity and performance\nIn the building and construction sector, the longevity and performance of materials are crucial for the\nsuccessful delivery of projects. Uncertainty regarding the longevity and performance of PwRC has been\ncited as a major factor limiting their use in modular construction. Several participants emphasised the\nimportance of addressing this concern when considering the procurement of PwRC.\n‘But the cost and availability of this product and performance of the product is, is one of\nthe key areas that we can consider at this point’ [C P ]\n1 2\n‘I think businesses would be open to using recycled materials as long as there was longevity\nin the material’ [C P ]\n1 3\n‘So there's a bit of a market expectation on us as well to make sure that what we're\nproviding is of a higher or highest quality’ [C P ]\n1 4\n11) Lack of experience dealing with the PwRC supply chain\nAs previously noted, the study organisation currently has limited capacity to incorporate PwRC into its\nmodular products. One participant reported that the organisation does not have a procurement\nstrategy specific to PwRC. Consequently, their ability to effectively engage with the PwRC supply chain", "text_len": 3541, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Two participants observed that this limitation could affect their procurement\nprocesses, even if the organisation is willing to enhance its sustainability impacts through the use of\nPwRC.\n‘So that's 100% something that I think ATCO is aware that it's got to get, but I don't know\nif ATCO has enough experience yet to be able to understand how to have those\nconversations with suppliers to then target that and look at that [C P ]\n1 5\n‘The process of procuring waste materials would be no different to procuring any material.\nWe would be, you know, trying to find it, we would be trying to understand it’ [C P ]\n1 5\n‘I think, it's really the challenges that they face around increasing recycled content is\naround engaging those suppliers and what they're doing to drive, you know, drive change\nin their manufacturing route and yeah, so for us, it's something we've solved, but for those\nother manufacturers that I spoke about they’re, they're each on a journey, those journeys\nare on different trajectories’ [C P ]\n1 6\n12) Reliance on mainstream supply chain\nThe study organisation predominantly depends on mainstream, or shorter supply chains- as described\nby C P - for material procurement. Although this procurement strategy offers practical benefits, such\n1 1\nas greater control, it can significantly hinder the adoption of PwRC. Indeed, this limited pool of\nsuppliers may struggle to provide a diverse range of PwRC that meet the requirements.\n‘We use mainstream suppliers, Armstrongs, the Tarketts, the Polyflors and those kinds of\nthings. So, if a fourth player were to enter into the market, maybe a smaller player, but\nmaybe had a higher recycled content, and even if they were cost competitive, that would\nbe a challenge to replace that in, because it becomes a company decision and rather than\na project-specific decision if you like’ [C P ]\n1 1\n‘So what I mean by a shorter supply chain is, if we have an established supplier who holds\nstock, who we deal with very well, we already have the correct payment terms and all that\nother kind of stuff’. [C P ]\n1 6\n‘In terms of the materials purchased and procured to manufacture new products and to\nmaintain old products, what I found with ATCO is that they've got very long-standing\nrelationships with suppliers that they've managed over years and years and years and\nmoving away from those—and they've got great cost control because of that—and\ninvestigating new is where they haven't really had procurement focus’ [C P ]\n1 5\n‘So, you know, that is the main challenge for them around accessing the required spread\nof materials that they would use from suppliers who have high recycled contents, and they\ndon't have the ability to switch those out’ [C P ]\n1 6\n13) Varying PwRC specs in modular construction\nIt is a fact that sometimes the application requirements vary between modular and standard\nconstruction. As such, the PwRC suppliers need to meet varying requirements for the same material if\nthey want to be engaged in both modular and standard construction markets. Two participants raised\ntheir concerns about this issue:\n‘Determining its fit for purpose, particularly within the module of building space where\nsometimes the parameters extend beyond, what we’d say, traditional building materials\nwhere I've got to worry about things like. So things like say calcium silicate board is very\ngood in traditional buildings, but you wouldn't use it in a modular building because it", "text_len": 3464, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

It would break unless you applied a certain glue, a certain consistency, and\nhaving, you know, you would have to alter the engineering parameters about the use of\nthe product just to incorporate that within a modular structure’ [C P ]\n1 1\n‘Like the majority of all these sales reps, “Yes, it meets the requirement of the NCC\n[National Construction Code]”. But when it comes to construction then, if we applied\ninstall in a separate way different way, it's not going to meet the requirements, or it was\ngoing to lose the warranty of those products’ [C P ]\n1 2\n14) Limited reporting capacity\nBoth the organisation and the supply chain lack a mature infrastructure for reporting on PwRC usage.\nThe absence of data needed for planning and decision-making in modular construction can discourage\nkey stakeholders, including sustainability-focused clients, from using PwRC in projects.\n‘So sometimes we end up finding in construction, we're ticking a box without actually\nhaving any data that's usable from that, and the industry's not there necessarily learning’\n[C P ]\n1 5\n‘We've got limited data on the used side as opposed to the purchase side, and we're trying\nto get on top of that’ [C P ]\n1 5\n‘How are we, what like, what recycling products are we using? How am I reporting through\nNGER [National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting] my impact on that project? So what\nends up happening is they go, “Look, we still have to get you to fill it out. So just put it, just\nsend this e-mail with the reporting template every month with zero’ [C P ]\n1 5\n‘The transparency of waste diversion ratios is the harder part because each individual\nsupplier of those waste services will have different and varied levels of ability to report for\nus. So that's the bit that I've struggled with in the past two years, is getting consistent data\nto then analyse that data and set targets for improvement on diversion ratios for waste’\n[C P ]\n1 5\n15) Limited capacity to integrate PwRC into production processes\nDespite the organization having its own manufacturing unit, its current business model does not\npromote the internal integration of recycled materials into modular components. According to C P ,\n1 5\nthe organisation typically purchases final products that may or may not include recycled content, a\npractice that appears to be standard across the industry. This approach significantly limits the potential\nto optimise the use of PwRC in modular construction, as it hinders the organisation's ability to directly\ninfluence and incorporate sustainable materials into its production processes.\n‘[We use recycled materials] If the base material comes with that built-in, so one of the\nkey things that I think it’ll come in and one of the later questions, is that we use a such a\nsmall palette of materials’[C P ]\n1 1\n‘Getting that as a raw product is not gonna happen for ATCO 'cause we don't necessarily\nuse a raw product. We then use, you know, we use steel, we don't get the raw product and\nthen blend it with steel because we don't make our own steel. We don't make our own\nwall panelling etc. So, we're always using the end product. So, we would never be directly\nprocuring raw waste’ [C P ]\n1 5\n16) Short-term thinking in decision-making process\nShort-term thinking in decision-making can restrict the organisation's ability to embrace innovation\nand change, especially in areas like the circular economy in modular construction.

However, if the price is\n#1, then those options can look quite expensive in the short term’ [C P ]\n1 4\n‘The issue is that we haven't made up a decision yet because it's more like a salesperson\nwalk in… we're kind of looking to other what other competitors are doing at the moment\nwhere the other competitors are’ [C P ]\n1 2\n5.5 Drivers of using PwRC in modular construction\nThe analysis of interviews showed that there could be six major drivers for using PwRC in modular\nconstruction. These factors are illustrated below.\nFigure 11. Major drivers for using PwRC in the case study\n1) Supportive organisational targets\nThe incorporation of PwRC into modular products can be influenced by organisational targets/KPIs.\nThese targets catalyse the required change in the organisational procurement model.\n‘We've got a corporate sort of structure and sometimes, shall we say, mandates certain\ntargets. So some of those targets get driven down into obviously managing directors and\nyou know the director of the various business groups…so some of that decision-making\ncan be KPI-driven in terms of we must now start to use this, if that's the directive, you\nknow, we must reduce waste by this amount or increase utilisation of renewables by this\namount and those kind of things [C P ].\n1 2\n‘The main motivators for us, though, our opportunities on the supply side to, you know\nincrease circularity to drive that economic and social return through diversion from landfill,\nthe reduced greenhouse gas emissions [C P ].\n1 6\n2) Financial benefits\nThe other motivating factor relates to whether these materials generate any financial benefits.\nAccording to the interviews (C P , C P and C P ), this factor can be a significant change facilitator in\n1 2 1 2 1 4\nthe decision-making process. However, these criteria vary depending on the material. For instance, the\nrecycled alternative in steel is generally more cost-effective than in timber products. Furthermore, the\nlong-term financial benefits of utilising these resources can be realised by integrating the reuse of\nwaste materials into standard business practices. Over time, this will lead to a reduction in production\nand operational costs (C P ).\n1 4", "text_len": 2476, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

This inclination may stem from their\nneed to showcase their sustainability commitments, whether by reporting to public agencies, aiming\nfor formal recognition through a sustainability rating system, or publicly promoting their dedication to\nsustainability. The client’s preference typically is translated into contractual obligations. In this space,\nthe government plays a key role in pushing a sustainability agenda including using PwRC in their assets\nand construction projects.\n‘Some of our, shall we say, bigger clients, particularly in the mining and resource sector,\nthey have global minimum standards, and they want full material traceability and that\nkind of things, and that pushes you down a certain supply chain, if you like’. [C P ]\n1 1\n‘Basically, we received a lot of requests from education tender…But yeah, predominantly\nthe education sector across Australia is the driving force behind introducing new recycled\nmaterials. It's all about that, helping the environment and things like that [C P ]\n1 2\n‘Really it comes down to contractual obligations, we rarely find a cheaper cost alternative\nwith recycled products, I guess in application to our buildings I would say’ [C P ].\n1 3\n‘Whereas tier one builders they, you know, report to the government, they're doing\ngovernment work so they are held commercially to these standards…like a Green Star\nchecklist that they would have to fill out, which says, “how do you do this? How do you do\nthat? ”In which case, they would need to engage sustainable materials or practises to be\nable to tick those boxes’ [C P ]\n1 4\n‘So what it is that a customer needs as part of their contractual requirements or\nobligations from their customers as well… contractual obligations generally, or often, on\ngovernment projects, be they transport infrastructure projects that drive requirements for\nvery high recycled contents across all materials.’ [C P ].\n1 6\n4) Securing public projects\nIn some cases, the client for ATCO S&L products is the government which is typically in favour of\nenhancing sustainability in their procurement (C P ). The growing demand for environmentally\n1 4\nsustainable practices, including the use of green materials in government construction projects, is a\nsignificant driving force behind the adoption of PwRC in modular construction.\n‘We have received a couple of requests [tender documentation] from especially education,\nand they introduce, and I've seen a couple of new materials being introduced to get on to\nit, to get a quote or design based off those materials’ [C P ].\n1 2\n‘It definitely ticks a box for a lot of government jobs. So we need to be playing in that space\nbecause otherwise, you know, if we're not being sustainable, we're not using recycled\nmaterials, it could be the difference between us winning and losing a job. So we want to\nmake sure that we're putting ourselves in the best position to win these jobs as possible’\n[C P ].\n1 4\n‘I would call it a regulatory role, in terms of the major rating tools and a regulatory role in\nterms of any particular government or other organisations that provide or drive the", "text_len": 3676, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

According to three participants (C P , C P and C P ) in the organisation,\n1 1 1 4 1 5\nstaff would like to push the sustainability agenda: we do still have a personal obligation as human\nbeings to try and do our best to make sure that we're not overusing things that we don't need to.

The analysis of interviews identified\n10 major strategies that companies involved in modular construction in Australia can employ to\nincrease the uptake of PwRC in their products. These strategies fall into three key domains:\norganisational capacity building, supply chain management assessment and improvement, and\nsustainable business decision-making.\nAmong these, the categories of \"attitudinal changes and awareness raising\" and \"internal\nopportunities for material recyclability and reuse\" were found to have the most significant positive\nimpact. The identified categories are illustrated in Figure 12.", "text_len": 1916, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

{"source_file": "75.Case-Study-1-1-ATCO-SL.pdf", "page_num": 41, "text": "1) Long term thinking\nThe long-term thinking approach involves planning and deciding with a focus on future outcomes\nrather than just immediate benefits. At present, the use of PwRC does not necessarily yield immediate\neconomic benefits, with both potential and tangible advantages often materializing only over the long\nterm. Therefore, organisations in the modular construction sector aiming to enhance sustainability and\nachieve their business objectives must adopt long-term thinking in their decision-making processes,\nparticularly when it comes to incorporating PwRC into their products. This point was made by C P who\n1 4\nsuggested that long-term thinking is the key to success:\n‘These days, a lot of businesses are making a lot more, especially ATCO, long-term\ndecisions as opposed to short-term decisions within the business to ensure that we're\ndoing the right things to put us in a good frame coming into the next five, 10, 20 years’\n[C P ].\n1 4\n‘In the first instance, it [PwRC] is more expensive than what we're currently doing.\nHowever, over time, it is actually a lot cheaper because there is not the continued wastage\nand labour involved in redoing the same thing over and over again … so there was actually\na business motive there to, you know, increase our profits, I guess, at the end of the day,\nover the long term’ [C P ].\n1 4\n‘The economic, I think we've talked about that, which is the fact that a lot of these recycled\nproducts have a longer life span than the other ones. So, whilst they may be a higher initial\ninvestment, they certainly provide better economical advantages over the long term’\n[C P ].\n1 4\n2) Historic application of PwRC and confidence-building\nThe successful application of PwRC across the industry can significantly boost confidence in utilising\nthese resources. Two participants in this study emphasised that their organisation would be more likely\nto adopt PwRC in their products if these materials had been used in real-life projects and relevant data\nwere available. Creating demonstration modular projects where the study organization successfully\nintegrates PwRC offers a unique opportunity to lead the market and set a precedent in this area.\n‘If this product's being used, if there's a positive historical background of this product\nbeing used by the industry then, and it's cost effective, then the company will go down\ninto that line’ [C P ].\n1 2\n‘for ATCO in particular, to move into looking further at recyclable materials in their\nmanufacturing space, one of the things that would make it easier is having that\ninformation available to be more readily presented rather than having to do their own\ndigging and investigation’ [C P ].\n1 5\n3) Recycled product information and certification\nThree participants noted that certified information on PwRC can inform their procurement process.\nHowever, the effectiveness of this process can be hindered by the existence of various certification\nschemes and different product information. To address this, the organisation should develop new or\nutilise existing standard templates to ensure consistent and reliable product information is received.\nIn this process, consulting with trusted third-party PwRC certifiers and major suppliers is essential.\nSuch a template should outline the product's features (such as physical and chemical characteristics)\nas well as its functions (including quality, longevity, and performance). The template must align with\nsustainability reporting requirements, including Green Star, IS rating, LEED, and NGER. According to\nC P , the product information should be prepared and produced to demonstrate their conformity with\n1 2\nNCC.", "text_len": 3662, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

I don't necessarily speak to the salesman, but I will speak to the data\nthat they provide or don't provide’ [C P ].\n1 1\n‘Some sort of reuse of recycling materials and it should come with evidence, producing\nevidence that these products have been tested on the market and there’s some companies,\nthat they're doing all series of testing and certificates of conformance that it meets the\nrequirements of the NCC’ [C P ].\n1 2\n‘It's very easy to get the upfront cost analysis, it should be easy [to use PwRC] if the\nprovider of a recycled product has all that information around their product’ [C P ].\n1 5\n4) Effective marketing\nBeing able to communicate the sustainability practice of the organisation can offer a series of benefits.\nAccording to C P these benefits may include having a positive return on the business and more clients\n1 5\nwould like to work with the organisation compared to their competitors. Sustainability is a key selling\npoint for businesses in the current and future industry climates. The use of these products in modular\nconstruction can be aligned with many sustainability initiatives including Environmental, social, and\ngovernance (ESG) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Reporting the achievement of these\ngoals, along with promoting the improved organisation's socio-environmental profile through targeted\nmarketing tools, can enhance visibility across industry, government sectors, and the general public.\nThis increased visibility can lead to greater customer reach, stronger brand recognition, and enhanced\ncredibility within the market.\nEffective marketing strategies are essential for achieving the best outcomes. These strategies should\ncommunicate and highlight the journey behind the use of PwRC, the organisation's achievements, and\nthe benefits they offer, ensuring maximum visibility and impact.\n‘You can offset cost for cost, if we can then also demonstrate how we can market it and\nATCO’s not a big marketer, a self-marketer in the industry. We need to, you know, one of\nmy tasks […] is to drive more marketing. Even if that's B2B marketing for ATCO structures\nin Australia, one of those things is we need to get better at marketing and that's where\nhaving improved ESG is a marketable thing for every business in Australia moving forward’\n[C P ].\n1 5\n‘To be able to lead it, from a marketing perspective, from a global perspective and show\nhow good we can be in this, what prevents me from doing that, it's really good business\ncase to say we can produce buildings at the same rate and the same volume that we're\ndoing, so with these products, these products are better for the environment because they\nare recyclable’ [C P ].\n1 5\n‘We can present that, we can be proud of that and that's going to actually have a positive\nreturn on our business because more and more people will want to work with ATCO rather\nthan with one of our competitors. So I, yeah, absolutely look at it and we should be kicking\nthe door down in this space’ [C P ].\n1 5\n5) Attitudinal changes and awareness-raising\nSeveral challenges highlighted in Figure 10 can be effectively addressed with this strategy. In particular,\nit can help overcome the industry's conservative approach and short-term thinking in decision-making.\nBy raising awareness among key stakeholders about the potential and actual benefits of using PwRC,\nthis strategy can accelerate the procurement and application of these products in modular\nconstruction projects.", "text_len": 3571, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Understanding how it would benefit our processes and our methodology\nconstruction methodology in modular. I think largely people would be happy to entertain\nusing recycled products as long as we understood the benefits, better understand’ [C P ]\n1 3\n‘It's more getting the big players in the modular industry, like we said earlier, to change\ntheir mindset so that they can accept like for like, or not like for like, but like for different\nwith a better outcome’ [C P ]\n1 5\n‘It's being able to present all the answers to them [senior managers in modular\nconstruction companies] before you even ask them to look at it, is the key driver for success\nfor me’ [C P ]\n1 5\n6) Leveraging the purchasing power of key players\nKey players in the modular construction industry, such as ATCO S&L, possess significant influence to\nmake the use of PwRC a standard practice across the sector. As market leaders, these companies\nshould focus on building internal capacity to effectively procure and integrate PwRC into their\nproducts. Once these practices are established as the industry norm, it will encourage SMEs to adopt\nsimilar procurement strategies, further embedding PwRC use in the industry. According to C P their\n1 4,\npurchasing power can generate sustainable demand for these products, potentially leading to\neconomies of scale and a reduction in production costs. The organisation and the recycling industry\ncan capitalise on the advantages of mass production, leading to enhanced profit margins.\n‘If the big companies are not pushing and being part of the strategy, then it's never going\nto work. It's never going to work [C P ]\n1 3\n‘ATCO’s a big company, we have a lot of buying power. You know, we could start to look\nat creating partnerships with companies who sell the products that we require for\nsustainable or recycled materials so that we can look to get better buying power and\ntherefore create a lower price point for our clients’ [C P ]\n1 4\n7) Setting targets through organisational or government policies\nSetting targets for using recycled content in products can guide processes involved in the\nprocurement and application of PwRC in construction projects. Reasonably set targets can drive\nnumerous changes within organizations, including fostering innovation, promoting\naccountability, building market demand, and encouraging collaboration across material supply\nchains. According to C P , the government can play a pivotal role in setting these targets by\n1 3\ndeveloping policies such as sustainable procurement guidelines.\n‘We've got a corporate sort of structure and sometimes that […] mandates certain targets.\nSo some of those targets get driven down into obviously managing directors […].\nSo some of that decision making can be KPI-driven in terms of we must now start to use’\n[C P ]\n1 1\n‘I think it would help if there was a push, potentially from the government as well…They\ndon't currently have any policy around using recycled material, they don't tend to’ [C P ]\n1 3\n‘Both from an initial, you know, what are we doing right now? Where's my benchmark?\nWhere's my baseline in that? And then to be able to sit there and go, OK, there's a massive\nopportunity to lead in this space, rather than to follow’ [C P ]\n1 5", "text_len": 3560, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "75.Case-Study-1-1-ATCO-SL.pdf", "page_num": 44, "text": "8) Internal opportunities for material recyclability and reuse\nOrganisations in modular construction can plan for maximum recyclability and reuse by incorporating\nthese considerations throughout their manufacturing, operation and execution phases. Such\nincorporation can be more effectively implemented through adopting a circular economy business\nmodel. This way they can influence their internal stakeholders to advance the circularity of their\nproducts. Almost all participants in this study emphasised the importance of exploring opportunities\nto capture the value of waste resources and enhance the utilisation of PwRC in modular construction.\nFor example, C P and C P stressed the need to revisit their production line to evaluate opportunities\n1 1 1 4\nfor material recyclability and reuse. Similarly, C P noted that their organisation aims to recapture\n1 6\nproduct waste resources for repurposing and reuse through extended producer responsibility\npractices.\n‘Simple builds are able to be reused and we try, we sell on that as well. We sell on the fact\nthat we can actually bring those back into the mainstream with very little in the way of\nupgrades and most of those are cosmetic and those kinds of things’ [C P ]\n1 1\n‘So, what we try to do there as much as possible and where possible is reuse certain\nmaterials. So, for example, our decks, we have steel framed decks…So we will take that\npart off the deck. We will throw that part out. But we will reuse the deck frame, reline it\nso that we don't have to continually go and get more steel framing built for our jobs’ [C P ]\n1 4\n‘But I think ATCO is also going to try and match that wherever we can and where it makes\nsense in our product lines so that we're providing it as a standard as opposed to on a job-\nby-job basis’ [C P ]\n1 4\n‘Now, they [low-grade polyply wall linings]'re great. They're cheap. They go up. If a client\ndamages it, you just unscrew it, you put a new sheet up. So being able to look at recyclable\nmaterials of that and in effect, it already is recyclable to an extent’ [C P ]\n1 5\n‘it's not so much the need for modular to look at how do we generate a product in the first\nplace? It's what products are out there, and how do we use them in our existing processes?\nit's not that the products and the research isn't already out in the market for recyclable,\nit's, “OK, where can we use this in the modular game” [C P ]\n1 5\n‘So as a business that is very much our focus from a point of view of maximising recycled\ncontent and then the idea of keeping that in, through its use phase and then to its end-of-\nlife phase and then recapturing that back through our recycling business or indeed any of\nthe other recycling channels or reuse opportunities to bring that back into as a new\nproduct or as a reused product to keep that loop going’ [C P ]\n1 6\n9) Active engagement in the material supply chain\nModular construction companies should actively engage in the material supply chain to influence their\nexternal stakeholders to achieve material circularity outcomes. Changes within the supply chain should\nfocus on waste reduction, increased utilisation of recycled content, and the enhancement of PwRC\nquality, longevity, and performance. According to C P , these changes should stem from strategic\n1 4\npartnerships with material suppliers involved in PwRC production and supply.\n‘Re-recycle it into our own product, if you like. So, if we had a closed-loop supply chain in\nterms of, say, the vinyl manufacturer…if you had a supplier of material down the road\nwhere, you know, the off-cuts could be taken straight back, put in a hopper, chopped up\nand then used to produce the same material again’ [C P ]\n1 1\n‘So, get me stillages that can be reused if they, if a client says they can’t. Or a supplier says\nthey can't supply it in the correct packaging to be reused. Then you send the packaging\nback with the next truck when they deliver’ [C P ]\n1 1", "text_len": 3927, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

You know,\nmicroplastics. Can we get microplastics? … Is there a potential way to actually blend those\nplastics from a container bottle scheme into the timber product with the bonding agents\nso that you've got a semi-waterproof product that then has a higher lifespan, and\ntherefore we're not replacing it as frequently’ [C P ]\n1 5\n10) Products buyback agreements\nThe final strategy involves creating contracts that explicitly stipulate a product buyback agreement\nbetween modular manufacturers and end-users. Given that modular products are not always used\npermanently, a buyback arrangement provides an opportunity for manufacturers to repurchase these\nitems from end-users. According to C P , this agreement offers mutual benefits: end-users can\n1 1\ngenerate revenue by selling unused products, while manufacturers gain the opportunity to recover\nmodular products either fully or partially. The materials salvaged from these end-of-life modular\nproducts can then be repurposed in new modular builds, promoting sustainability and resource\nefficiency.\n‘So sometimes we will sell a building with a buyback in there because we are better able\nto reuse and repurpose that building. The clients might have it for 5- 10 years and it's not\neconomical for them to rent it for that period of time, but it is economical for them to buy\nit, and then we will buy it back from them for an agreed price’ [C P ]\n1 1\n5.7 The future of PwRC applications in modular construction\nThe interviewees suggested that a broader application of PwRC in the modular construction industry\nis plausible in the future. However, several participants emphasised the necessity of specific changes\nfor this to materialise. These changes include overcoming the sector's conservative approach, its\nmindset transformation, preparing for a transitional phase, and achieving greater adoption within the\nconventional construction sector.

The organisation can also lead and influence the supply\nchain by implementing the tools and strategies proposed in this study, making the use of PwRC a\nstandard practice. To achieve this, the organisation should plan for a gradual implementation of these\nstrategies, aligning them with their priorities and business objectives.\nCurrently, many Australian governments are under pressure to meet the requirements of the SDGs\nand various climate change initiatives, such as the Paris Agreement. Government agencies involved in\nthe sustainability of built environments and construction activities can leverage the findings of this\nstudy to evaluate, plan, and prioritize the most effective actions to enhance sustainability outcomes\nmoving forward.\nThe building and construction sector should pay close attention to the modular construction space, as\nit is increasingly being proposed as a viable solution to housing crises both in Australia and globally.\nThe challenges identified in this study can help the industry prepare for a transition towards more\nmodular and sustainable buildings in the near and distant future. Thus, the sector has an excellent\nopportunity to reduce its environmental impact by incorporating PwRC in modular building products.", "text_len": 1416, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
