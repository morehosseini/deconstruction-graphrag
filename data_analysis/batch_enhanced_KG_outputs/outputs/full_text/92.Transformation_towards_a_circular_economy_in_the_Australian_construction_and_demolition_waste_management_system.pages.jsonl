Introduction\nThe architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is generally low in resource\nefficiency worldwide. As documented in the literature, this poor performance has resulted in\nserious negative environmental impacts caused by high construction and demolition (C&D)\nwaste generation, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air and water pollution, and forest\ndegradation. Globally, the construction industry is estimated to be responsible for approximately\n40% of energy consumption, 30% of CO emissions and 40% of total solid production waste\n2\n(Herczeg et al., 2014).\n2\n\n[TABLE CONTENT]\nAbb. | Description | Abb. | Description\nAEC | Architecture, Engineering and\nConstruction | WMRR | Waste Management and Resource Recovery\nBIM | Building Information Modelling | WDR | Waste Disposal Reduction\nC&D | Construction and Demolition\nWaste | RL | Reverse Logistics\nC&I | Commercial and Industrial Waste | NSW | New South Wales\nCE | Circular Economy | NT | Norther Territory\nDfD | Design for Disassembly | WA | Western Australia\nDoW | Design Out Waste | SA | South Australia\nEfW | Energy from Waste | QLD | Queensland\nEPR | Extended Producer Responsibility | Vic | Victoria\nGHG | Greenhouse Gas | Tas | Tasmania\nLoWMoR | Less of Waste, More of Resources | ACT | Australian Capital Territory\nPPP | Polluter Pays Principle | WA | Western Australia\nRWP | Recycled Waste Product | LCA | Life-Cycle Assessment\nUI-E | University-Industry Engagement | EIA | Environmental Impact Assessment", "text_len": 2291, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Australia's average national\nconstruction value growth rate shows that construction activities have increased (ABS, 2020) to\naccommodate the growing needs of urban populations. The population growth in the capital\ncities of Australia is influenced by overseas migrations (out-migration) and migration (in-\nmigration) from rural to urban areas (Forbes et al., 2020). Inevitably, extensive construction\nactivities are causing C&D waste generation at an unprecedented rate. According to the latest\nNational Waste Report, the Australian construction industry generated 27 mt of C&D waste in\n2019-20 (NWR, 2020), a 61% increase on the figures recorded in 2006–2007. Currently, this\nwaste stream, with more than 44% and 47% generated and recycled, respectively, is the largest\nsource of waste in Australia.\nA circular economy (CE) in this space offers a way to minimise waste's environmental and\neconomic costs, such as landfill maintenance, extracting virgin materials, landfill levies,\ntransportation costs and illegal dumping. The CE model, as a comprehensive strategy for\nsustainable development, has already spread throughout the world. This model has been\nconceptualised as a system that is restorative by design with a core strategic focus on reframing\nand reorganising materials, information and energy flow to achieve greater resource efficiency\nthrough the reuse, remanufacture and recycling of materials. Its key premise is that waste\nminimisation can act as a new source of value for a business (Martin, 2019). Fundamentally,\nthe concept of the CE model encapsulates the tension between limits and growth, advocating\nfor a shift from linear to circular patterns of resource use and management.

In\nresponse to the emerging socio-environmental issues caused by the improper management of\nC&D waste materials, Australian federal and state governments have started to prioritise these\nresources in their environmental planning (Australian Government, 2018). Much of the planning\nto date focuses on specific universally tried and tested mitigating strategies. Research and\neducation are critical factors highlighted in all waste strategy and guideline documents\n(Shooshtarian et al., 2020e, Desha and Caldera, 2019). Despite the abundance of research on\nC&D waste in the Australian context, limited studies have provided an overview of these\nindividual attempts. Some of the previous review studies focus on C&D waste energy recovery\n(Shooshtarian et al., 2019b), market development (Shooshtarian et al., 2020a, Tennakoon et\nal., 2021), policy analysis (Shooshtarian et al., 2020e), reusing recycled materials (Park and\nTucker, 2017), and waste data and reporting systems (Ratnasabapathy et al., 2019a).\nThis study aims to identify opportunities for waste disposal minimisation in various stages of the\nconstruction materials lifecycle, by examining at the literature investigating C&D waste\nmanagement in Australia. Within this context of waste reduction opportunities (i.e. minimising\nwaste generation) will be considered within design, manufacturing, procurement, transportation\nand construction stages. In addition, waste disposal reduction opportunities (i.e. minimising\nwaste ending up in landfills) will be discussed considering strategies to increase recovery (reuse,\nrecycle, upcycle) and prevent illegal dumping and stockpiling.

Theoretical framework\nThis review study builds on the CE objectives focusing on waste minimisation in the C&D waste\nresource cycle. Australia's previous studies draw on certain frameworks to classify and\ninvestigate issues and solutions centred around the C&D waste stream. For instance, some\nstudies use construction phases (e.g. procurement, design and planning, demolition and\nconstruction) to identify waste minimisation solutions (Kabirifar et al., 2021b, Zhao et al., 2021,\nDoust et al., 2021, Udawatta et al., 2020). Others employ a waste hierarchy framework\n(Ratnasabapathy et al., 2019c); the direction of financial flow across entities (Tennakoon et al.,\n2021); characteristics of the project (Li and Yang, 2014); three layers of waste management\nsolutions (i.e. organisation, process and people) (Davis et al., 2019a, Newaz et al., 2020); or\nroles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in waste management planning and practices\n(Park and Tucker, 2017).\nThis study, however, adopts a multi-dimensional approach to develop a framework that\naddresses waste management issues in more detail. This framework is informed by the CE\nconcept, various stages of the construction materials lifecycle, the waste management hierarchy\nand stakeholder perspectives. This framework (Figure 2), called Less of Waste, More of\nResources (LoWMoR) assumes that waste is not a waste but a resource. The LoWMoR\nframework aims to identify opportunities for diverting waste from landfills within various resource\nlifecycle stages. The framework proposes eleven components in which waste disposal can be\nminimised. This study employs LoWMoR to investigate C&D waste research in Australia.\n7", "text_len": 1689, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

For instance,\nan analysis of a case study in regional areas of the NT shows that design-related factors can\naffect the level of waste (Crawford et al., 2017). According to the authors, these factors include\ndesign changes, design complexity, design errors, missing information, designs not using\nstandard material sizes, and inconsistencies between design objectives and\nconstruction/demolition realities. Another study on retrofitting projects suggests that high project\ncomplexity, incompleteness, errors or uncertainty in design information and project variation are\ndesign-related waste management challenges (Li and Yang, 2014). Similarly, Shooshtarian et\nal. (2020b) list variations and changes, the complexity of detailing, selection of low-quality\nmaterials, lack of familiarity with alternative products, and errors in contract clauses or\nincomplete contract documents as the major design issues. Doust et al. (2021) report that design\nchanges (design and detailing errors) ranked first as Australia's most significant source of waste\ngeneration. Other design-related issues include the lack of adherence by builders to the waste\nmanagement plan embedded in tender documentation after securing the project (Doust et al.,\n2021, Davis et al., 2019b) and the influence of client non-waste efficient decisions on design\nteam behaviours (Udawatta et al., 2018).\nThe analysed literature provides opportunities for waste minimisation at the design stage. These\ninclude a commitment to reduce waste through input into the design process (Lingard et al.,\n2000, Gollagher et al., 2017); paying extra attention to the selection of durable, creating a\nsufficient critical mass that justifies recycling through reusable and recyclable construction\nmaterials with relatively homogeneity (Udawatta et al., 2015b, Fini and Forsythe, 2020);\nemphasizing the significant role of designers for reusing recycled materials that reduce recycling\n10", "text_len": 2100, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

The design team focusing on waste\nissues ideally consists of designers, architects, structural engineers, environmental consultants\nand waste management coordinators. Generally, the literature shows that, for the most part,\nclient and design team interaction determines how waste is to be managed, including type and\nquantity of waste generation (Crawford et al., 2017). Park and Tucker (2017) state that the\ndesign team should communicate the waste minimisation framework and associated strategies\nto clients at the design stage. This will result in the team making sustainable decisions that\nminimise waste disposal. In the authors' opinion, this is operationalised through improved\nawareness and change of attitudes. This task might not be delivered by contractors, according\nto Udawatta et al. (2018), as most construction project arrangements are price-driven.\nTherefore, designers can illustrate comparative cost performance at the early design stage\namong various waste management-related strategies (Tam et al., 2018).\nA detailed analysis of the literature yields several design-related strategies and concepts that\ntogether can address C&D waste issues in the AEC industry.

Some of these concepts overlap with waste minimisation opportunities in\nthe construction materials manufacturing stage.\nFrom the literature, it can be understood that designers and architects are unaware that waste\nmanagement should be an integral part of the AEC industry. Research findings from two studies\nshow that designers do not tend to take responsibility for waste or see its management as part\nof their role (Crawford et al., 2017, Udawatta et al., 2015a). This tendency can create a\ndisconnection between design objectives and construction practices. Recently, it has been\nargued that education will make a cultural shift geared towards sustainable construction that\ninvolves innovative and modern design promoting recycled or second-hand construction\nmaterials (Shooshtarian et al., 2020b). Park and Tucker (2017) point out that the shortage of\neducated designers with sustainability concerns who are willing to apply reused elements\nincreases the cost of reusing material.\nGiven the complex nature of construction projects, diversity of stakeholders and uncertain\nenvironment, a collaborative approach within the project team will result in better waste\nmanagement. Studies recommend an early and extended involvement of contractors in\nretrofitting projects (Li and Yang, 2014), new buildings (Gollagher et al., 2017) and infrastructure\nprojects (Doust et al., 2021).

To ensure a collaborative approach is maintained throughout the project\nlifecycle, effective communication is required. In Davis et al.

Reducing waste during procurement\nThe literature suggests that ineffective construction and procurement is a significant source of\nC&D waste generation. A research participant in a study by Udawatta et al. (2015b) states that\nconstruction practitioners do not allocate enough time for the planning stage when it is busy,\nwhich creates procurement and design problems. Therefore, adequate planning for\nprocurement with waste management prioritisation is necessary before the construction phase\n(Figure 5). In this phase, a correct estimation of materials is required (Shooshtarian et al.,\n2020b), as is adopting waste efficient technologies (Davis et al., 2021); time management for\nmaterial delivery (Shooshtarian et al., 2020b); and use of contract power to procure waste\nefficient materials and services (Davis et al., 2019a). Sustainable procurement (Park and\nTucker, 2017) is the main strategy that review studies recommend to reduce waste during\nprocurement.\nSustainable procurement, by definition, is a process whereby organisations meet their needs\nfor goods, services, works and utilities in a way that achieves value for money over their whole\nlife. Sustainable procurement provides an incentive for further waste recovery. This policy is\nsuggested in different Australian waste-related guidelines and strategy documents\n(Shooshtarian et al., 2020e), including the 2018 National Waste Policy (Australian Government,\n18", "text_len": 1740, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

One study reports that research participants indicate that sustainable procurement is a\ncrucial solution for organisational waste management as long as it is a viable option or the client\nconsents to pay extra (Davis et al., 2019b).\nSustainable procurement directly relates to market development for recovered C&D waste\nmaterials (Caldera et al., 2020b). Shooshtarian et al. (2020a) survey find that sustainable\nprocurement is among the top three factors contributing to C&D waste market development.\nThe literature analysis shows that Australia's relationship between procurement and C&D waste\nminimisation is not well studied. Hence, multiple research studies highlight the need to\ninvestigate the impact of procurement methods on WMPs (Teo and Loosemore, 2001, Udawatta\net al., 2015b, Doust et al., 2021).\nFigure 5. Issues, solutions and key stakeholders playing a role in C&D waste disposal reduction at the procurement stage\nCorrectly estimating the materials needed for a construction activity can save a significant\nquantity of unwanted materials that might otherwise have been landfilled. Inaccurate quantity\ntake-off and/or over-ordering ultimately create extra waste. In Australia, builders typically order\n2-3% more than is required to allow for offcuts and waste (Scarvaci and Barrett, 2019 as cited\n19", "text_len": 1321, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

However, on large jobs, the risk of over-ordering tends to be\nreduced because deliveries are made progressively throughout the project, and only the last\norder requires accurate take-off and ordering (Shooshtarian et al., 2020b). Doust et al. (2021)\nresearch findings show that procurement ordering and take-off errors are among Australia's five\ntop sources of C&D waste. The researchers also indicate that poor material control and logistics\nneed to be improved for the best results, and an integrated materials supply chain to drive\nefficient material flows is required. The use of technologies can be helpful for waste\nmanagement in the procurement stage. For instance, BIM can produce information on the exact\nquantities to order or prepare, resulting in minimum generation (Davis et al., 2019a).\nJust-in-time materials delivery to a construction site should be planned to avoid damage due to\ninsufficient space for proper storage and adverse weather conditions (BRE Group, 2019).\nMoreover, suppliers can be encouraged to provide more flexible \"last pack\" sizes (i.e. a\n\"fractional\" pallet instead of a full pallet) to minimise the waste because of over-ordering.\nAnother management strategy relating to the procurement stage is the effective utilisation of\ncontractual agreements that present an opportunity to minimise C&D waste. Through this\nagreement, stakeholder responsibilities for waste management are identified, and they are\nrequired to incorporate waste minimisation activities in their work schedule and discipline poor\nwaste management. There is evidence that even the type of contract could influence how waste\nis generated. For instance, it is reported that \"fix only\" subcontracts rarely motivate bricklayers\nto reuse offcuts (Shooshtarian et al., 2020b). This strategy plays a vital role in public projects\nwhere government purchase power, via a sustainable procurement policy, can guide\nstakeholders' waste management decisions and behaviour (Davis et al., 2019b, Hardie et al.,\n2007).\n20", "text_len": 2042, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Hence, a factor that plays an important role in\nadopting sustainable WMPs is the right attitude. Attitudes represent peoples' evaluations of\nobjects or situations that predispose them to behave in a certain way (Azjen, 1993). According\nto the theory of reasoned action, behaviour is controlled by intention and intention is influenced\nby attitudes and subjective norms (Bagozzi, 1992).\nIn terms of attitudes among construction players, however, the findings in the literature are\nmixed. While some studies report labourers care more about waste management than\nmanagement teams (Lingard et al., 2000, Teo et al., 2000), other studies provide opposing\nevidence (Tam et al., 2018). Lingard et al. (2000) state that labourers consider that waste\nmanagement is beyond their control, not cost-effective and that senior management is not\nsupportive of WMPs. Udawatta et al. (2015a) found that decisions on WMPs in Australian\ncommercial construction projects follow financial benefits unless project owners are required to\ncomply with requirements set by sustainable building rating systems. The authors report that\nowners of these projects resist reusing or using recycled products (Udawatta et al., 2015a). In\nrecent years, with more sustainability awareness and requirements, as well as available\nincentives and perceived financial benefits from waste recycling (Crawford et al., 2017),\nmanagers are more conscious about WMPs. Tam et al. (2018) show that unsupportive work\nroutines and operating procedures, the task's difficulty as opposed to the convenience offered\nby waste collection for landfilling, and the minimal impact of employers on labourers waste\nhandling behaviour are among the top reasons why labours do not exercise WMPs. Crawford\net al.

A study in Australia shows that poor workmanship could generate up to\n75% of total brick waste in a construction project (Forsythe and Máté, 2007), and the estimated\ncost for ordering materials to cover the wastage during construction is found to be 4% of the\ntotal construction cost for a standard house in Australia (Treloar et al., 2003).

In this space, the\ndeconstruction technique is more environmentally sustainable, which results in less waste\ndisposal. In selective deconstruction, some materials are targeted for reusing and recycling.\nProject planning involves the scheduling for dismantling components, defining work tasks,\nchoosing the technology and estimating the required resources.

Reducing waste disposal through recovery: reusing, recycling and upcycling\nMinimisation of C&D waste disposal is best practised through waste recovery. Waste recovery\ncan be described as any operation in which the principal result is waste serving a useful resource\nby replacing other materials which would otherwise have been used to fulfil a particular function,\nor waste being prepared to fulfil that function, in the plant or in the wider economy (Hall, 2010).\nAccording to the waste hierarchy concept, waste recovery (in the forms of reusing, recycling,\nupcycling and energy recovery) is the most preferred waste management method after waste\nminimisation. The following sections present key literature related to the abovementioned\nrecovery methods, and other influential factors such as technology, marketplace and policies\nenabling waste recovery in the AEC industry.\nReusing construction materials in the AEC industry does not currently receive support due to a\nwide range of inhibiting factors specified in the literature (Canberra Business Chamber, 2014,\nFini and Forsythe, 2020). But recycling has received much attention due to its ability to use the\nrecycled waste products (RWP) in the same industry as it was generated, while upcycling occurs\nbetween two industries, otherwise known as industrial symbiosis (Caldera et al., 2020b).\nIn comparison with recycling, upcycling has not been well adopted by the AEC industry, waste\nrecycling sector and government sector.

Issues, solutions and key stakeholders playing a role in C&D waste disposal reduction through waste recovery\nThe significant aspects of waste minimisation during waste recovery include technology,\ninfrastructure, policy, stakeholders’ knowledge and attitude towards waste minimisation,\nengagement and end-market development. The following sections review the above aspects to\ndeepen our understanding of the waste recovery climate in Australia.\nIn the literature, technological advances and fitting infrastructures are repeatedly cited as\nsignificant enablers in waste minimisation activities during waste recovery (Ratnasabapathy et\nal., 2019b).

This finding also implies a limitation in technologically advanced recovery\nfacilities across Australia. Newaz et al. (2020) conclude that technologies related to C&D waste\nprocessing are improving rapidly in Australia, and Shooshtarian et al. (2020c) state that the\nsuccess of many WMPs and strategies is subject to the availability of technologically advanced\ninfrastructure. The main technologies used to perform energy recovery are either based on\nthermal treatment or biological processing of biodegrade waste and include: [1] combustion\nproducing heat; [2] gasification that generates a combustible syngas; [3] pyrolysis that produces\nsyngas, oil or char; [4] anaerobic digestion/fermentation that produces biogas; and [5]\nmechanical sorting and processing that produces combustible refuse derived fuel (RDF).\nThe main stakeholders influencing WMPs include recycling facilities operators, the government,\nthe public and buyers of RWPs in this stage. A review study shows that clients' lack of interest\nand demand, attitudes towards reuse practices, and inadequate training act as disincentives to\nproactive and sustainable waste recovery. In their research to identify significant barriers to\nusing RWP, Ratnasabapathy et al. (2021) find that the lack of knowledge about implementing\nadvanced technology to recycle waste material is an essential factor. As for Australian\nperceptions of EfW activities, the limited literature investigating this issue shows that incineration\nis not tolerated among the public due to environmental concerns. This perception is expected\nto gradually change over the coming years (Shooshtarian et al., 2019b).\nThe relevant policies that are directly influential in this space include the proximity principle; the\nban of waste import by China and other countries; and landfill levy exemptions. In 2018, China’s\nnew policy, called China’s National Sword Policy, banned recyclable waste imports and made\nrecyclable commodity prices collapse.

The literature indicates that Australia's C&D\nwaste market development has not progressed as expected (Park and Tucker, 2017, Udawatta\net al., 2018).

The web-based waste marketplaces, otherwise known as waste\nexchange systems, are technically live databases to connect organisations seeking to dispose\nof materials with organisations looking to reuse or recycle the same materials (Corder et al.,\n2014). Some studies explore the performance of these systems (Corder et al., 2014, Caldera et\nal., 2020a, King et al., 2020), demonstrating a failure to achieve their pre-defined objectives.\nHence, recent publications pay particular attention to marketplace development, maintenance\nand performance issues. For instance, Caldera et al. (2020b) develop a framework that helps\nresearchers investigate the main barriers and enablers to developing these systems, drawing\non three major categories: governance, operational and market. Corder et al.

Interestingly, opinions about this issue are divided. While some\nresearchers argue that the national waste marketplace provides sustainable supply and demand\n(Shooshtarian et al., 2020a, Ratnasabapathy et al., 2021), others view this as an existential risk\nto the development of such entities (Hardie et al., 2007, Laviano et al., 2017, Wu et al., 2020)\ndue to issues such as motivation for waste disposal, higher cost of operation across states,\njurisdictional waste regulation inconsistencies and higher waste transfer costs.

While landfill sites are diminishing in its capacity(Crawford\net al., 2017), Gollagher et al. (2017) highlights the significant costs associated with landfilling as\n$1.4 billion annually. Waste landfilling is the least preferred waste management method, and\nthe worldwide literature has emphasised its adverse effect on the economy, environment and\nsociety (Yazdani et al., 2021); however, it is still an integral part of waste management in\nAustralia. In this section, the analytical findings from the literature with relevance to issues\nrelated to landfill are presented.\nCurrently, landfilling is the preferred construction industry method for managing C&D waste due\nto its convenience and lower cost (low landfill levy) over other waste management options\n(Figure 10), plus its extended operation hours (Chileshe et al., 2019, Fini and Forsythe, 2020).\nUdawatta et al.

Shooshtarian et al. (2020c) argue that while a landfill levy is the best\neconomic driver in some circumstances, it can act as a disincentive in other circumstances,\nsuch as increased illegal dumping and waste transfer and reduced waste recycling.\nRameezdeen et al. (2016) study on RL in the SA construction industry demonstrates that a\nhigher landfill levy could cause illegal dumping. This conclusion is also confirmed in a state (WA)\ngovernment report (as cited in Zhao et al., 2021).\nOne study in Qld shows impacts of state government decisions related to introducing and\nrevoking landfill levies on recycling rates of C&D waste (Forghani et al., 2017).

The researchers document C&D\nwaste transfer between NSW and ACT, NSW and Qld, SA and Victoria, a problem that can be\nalleviated by policies such as the proximity principle (Jayasinghe et al., 2018), whereby waste\ntransfer over long distances is restrained.

The revenue from the imposition of a landfill levy is partially used to\nimprove enforcement and compliance, development of sound policies, and to fund actions and\nstrategies that contribute to waste minimisation. There is no nationally prescribed method for\ndistributing levies for such purposes in Australia, and each state government does so according\nto its priorities and objectives (Shooshtarian et al., 2020c).\nThe studies reviewed provide some recommendations to improve waste management related\nto waste landfilling. For instance, Shooshtarian et al. (2020c) indicate that effective strategies\ninclude harmonisation of landfill levies; complementing levy imposition with technology-enabled\ncompliance and enforcement regimes; consideration of transport fees and potential cost\nimplications for construction activities when determining the levy rate; reinvestment of landfill\nlevy revenue in resource recovery activities through, for example, providing low-interest loans\nor financial incentives; supporting R&D activities; and increasing local infrastructures. Another\npotential strategy for waste minimisation in landfills is to maximise the use of energy recovered\n(mainly methane gas) from combustible C&D waste materials destined for landfills\n(Shooshtarian et al., 2019b). The research by Tam et al. (2009) in Qld suggests that landfill\noperators should introduce a differential charging of a levy to motivate C&D waste source\nseparation. Further, efficient waste data and reporting systems that capture the exact quantity\nof landfilled waste would improve planning and regulation for better waste minimisation through\nlandfilling or otherwise (Ratnasabapathy et al., 2019a). Effective waste landfilling is supported\nby engineered landfills adjacent to transfer stations and reprocessing centres for optimum\ntransportation (Jayasinghe et al., 2018).

Lastly, the\nanalysis of stakeholders involved in the reviewed studies shows that landfill operators' opinions\nare barely, less than 2%, captured in extant research studies. This highlights the need for further\nresearch to explore opportunities for waste minimisation and resource efficiency at the landfilling\nstage.\nDrawing on global precedents, other strategies such as landfill levies (Duran et al., 2006), storing\n(landfilling) C&D waste in a separate landfill section (Duan et al., 2015), and material recovery\nat material recovery facilities located in the area of a landfill site (Gálvez-Martos and Istrate,\n2020) have been identified through key literature from China, USA and European countries. For\nexample, a previous study shows that landfilling C&D waste may be done in a separate landfill\nso the waste can be stored safely for future use in earthwork or road projects. If such a landfill\nsite is not available, the waste may be stored in a special cell at a MSW landfill or used as a\ncover at MSW landfills (Duan et al., 2015).\n3.9.

The issues under the operations category include: lack of\noperational adherence to the WMP; limited quality control; inadequate waste sorting and\nstorage facilities; and lack of consistent reporting on operations. The issues under the\nlaws and regulations category include: unsupportive regulatory framework; restrictions\non waste exports; and the complexity of policy establishment. In addition, there were\nrecurrent issues related to lack of market demand, low material quality, lack of quality\nstandards and high costs associated with functions related to each stage.\nThe most evident strategies used across different stages of LoWMoR include\ncollaboration and laws and regulations. The strategies under collaboration include:\nreverse logistics, sustainable procurement; stakeholder engagement; collaboration\nacross key experts; well-coordinated waste transfer. The strategies under laws and\nregulations include: upfront levy liability; creating harmonised levy rates; effective\ndistribution of levy revenues; levy exemptions; and EPR). Furthermore, there were other\nstrategies related to the application of technologies (remote sensing, image processing,\nBuilding Information Modelling), waste tracking systems and certification to efficiently\nmanagement of C&D waste.\nAs per the analysis of research participants recruited in the Australian studies, the top\nstakeholders include waste operators, project managers, government (regulators), sub-\ncontractors, and others (designers/architects, site managers and recyclers). It can be\nconcluded that these stakeholders have an essential role in driving WMP and WMR, and\ntherefore, need to be involved in waste management planning, as highlighted by a few\nstudies (Park and Tucker, 2017, Udawatta et al., 2015b). However, as waste management\ninvolves varying aspects and requirements in each construction project, stakeholder\n48", "text_len": 1987, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Such involvement will lead to achieving a circular economy\nin the AEC industry.\nTo address the key issues synthesized in the above matrix and to create targeted strategies\nthe authors summarise the following recommendations based on the findings from the key\nliterature examined.\n4.1. Research collaboration\nThe identified literature shows that research collaboration on C&D waste management\nbetween different institutes and among universities and industries is not well established in\nAustralia. As Scherer (2005) writes, the benefits of research collaboration include\nʹincreased chance of successʹ, ʹcomplex projectsʹ, ʹgrants and fundingʹ, ʹavoidance of errorsʹ\nand ʹrespectʹ. Therefore, funding agencies and research institutes should revisit their policy\nto encourage further international research collaborations (Darko et al., 2020). Despite the\nchallenges such as organisational culture and communication highlighted by different\nresearchers (Reddy et al., 2018), research collaboration can aid states and territories in\nmitigating real-world issues such as skill shortages, inadequate education and research\ncapacities, and lead to technology and knowledge exchange among states. The issues of\ninterstate collaboration could be, however, addressed to maximise the benefits of such\ncollaborations. Notably, research collaboration with industry experts and University-\nIndustry (U-IE) engagement needs to be prioritised to facilitate knowledge transfer between\nresearch institutes and the industry. U-IE is found to generate benefits such as learning,\naccess to in-kind resources and access to funding (Henningsson and Geschwind, 2019).\n49", "text_len": 1771, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
{"source_file": "92.Transformation towards a circular economy in the Australian construction and demolition waste management system.pdf", "page_num": 51, "text": "Di Maria et al. (2019) find that industry financial performance is positively associated with\nU-I collaboration centred around knowledge transfer for environmental innovation and that\nthe higher the U-I contracts activated, the better the economic performance.\n4.2. Harmonisation of waste management systems\nIn Australia, waste is regulated by state and territory governments. The literature reveals\nthat inconsistent waste management climates across Australia impede sustainable C&D\nwaste management. For instance, Park and Tucker (2017) report that inconsistent\nlegislation around sustainable buildings hinders the use of RWP. Hence, harmonisation of\nwaste management regulatory systems and practices can benefit all parties involved in\nC&D waste management. Some studies highlight the benefits of harmonising regulations\npertaining to C&D waste management, such as preventing construction companies from\nsending their waste away (Davis et al., 2019b) and reducing complications for companies\noperating in various states (Shooshtarian et al., 2020c). A national approach, led by the\nfederal government, however, needs to be devised in consultation with state and territory\nauthorities to ensure their potential specific conditions and concerns are properly reflected\nin any policies emerging from this initiative.\n5. Conclusions\nThis research aimed to identify the main opportunities and barriers to minimise C&D waste\ndisposal, through a review of 62 pieces of Australian literature. The limitations of previous\nstudies were outlined, and future research directions were identified to further explore the\nfield of C&D waste management. A circular economy-based model developed in this study,\nLoWMoR, guided the analysis of the Australian literature review. Overall, this study\n50", "text_len": 1782, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Key issues related to operations\n(e.g., lack of operational adherence to the WMP, quality control, inadequate waste sorting\nand storage facilities, lack of consistent reporting on operations) and laws and regulations\n(e.g., unsupportive regulatory framework, a ban on waste exports, the complexity of policy\nestablishment) were uncovered across a number of stages in the construction materials\nlifecycle. Key strategies related to collaboration (e.g., reverse logistics, sustainable\nprocurement, stakeholder engagement, collaboration across key experts, well-coordinated\nwaste transfer), laws and regulations (e.g., upfront levy liability, harmonised levy rates,\neffective distribution of levy revenues, levy exemptions, EPR) were highlighted in LoWMoR\nstages. Based on the synthesis of the key findings, the authors provide recommendations\non fostering research collaboration; analysis of stakeholders’ needs and requirements in\ndevising a waste minimisation plan; and the need for federal government-led harmonisation\nof C&D waste management systems in Australia.\nThe study contributes to the body of knowledge in two ways. Firstly, policymakers and\nauthorities can use the developed LoWMoR model to devise action plans for waste\nminimisation activities; it is also beneficial to research studies seeking to achieve a circular\neconomy and resource efficiency in various industries. Secondly, the study can provide an\nagenda for further research into Australia's C&D waste management climate. Further\nresearch is recommended in the following areas: the benefits of I-UE in the AEC and\nWMRR industries; the impact of technologies in achieving waste minimisation objectives in\nAustralia; waste minimisation opportunities during construction material transportation;\nanalysing the economic impacts of the framework (e.g., through a LCA or EIA); and the\ndirect impact of sustainability rating tools in C&D waste minimisation.\n51", "text_len": 2068, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
