The series of handbooks is\nbeing developed in response to comments and concerns expressed by government,\nindustry and the community that relate to the built environment. Handbooks expand\non areas of existing regulation or relate to topics which have, for a variety of reasons,\nbeen deemed inappropriate for regulation. They provide non-mandatory advice and\nguidance.\nDevelopment of Performance Solutions has until recently been largely unregulated.\nOutside of fire safety design, little guidance material to understand the importance of\nthe Performance Solution development process has been available to assist\npractitioners. This handbook has been developed in response to government and\nindustry requests for guidance specifically on the application of the requirements\nintroduced into the National Construction Code (NCC) with Amendment 1 of NCC\n2019, specifically clause A2.2(4).\nIt will assist a range of stakeholders with the application of the performance-based\nNCC, as well as understanding the relationship between the NCC and respective\nstate and territory legislative systems. Typically, legislative systems require\ncompliance with the NCC for construction of new buildings and new work to be\nundertaken on existing buildings.\nThis handbook addresses issues in generic terms. It is not a document that sets out\napproaches that may be taken in dealing with specific issues. It is expected that this\nhandbook will be used to develop solutions relevant to specific situations in\naccordance with the generic principles and criteria contained herein.\nabcb.gov.au Page i", "text_len": 1933, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

Additional stakeholder identification and decisions about the timing of\nengagement of stakeholders in the process may stem from this knowledge. Early\nstakeholder engagement is beneficial for all Performance Solutions, especially those\nwith greater complexity as more time may be needed to resolve competing design\nrequirements.\nComplexity impacts the process of developing a solution because of a number of\nfactors including:\n• the number of Performance Requirements that are to be met using a\nPerformance Solution (i.e. potential interaction between competing design\nelements (e.g. energy vs fire));\n• the extent to which the client brief establishes acceptance criteria that exceed\nminimum compliance requirements (e.g. In a hospital with a MRI machine on an\nupper level floor slab requires stringent vibration resistance of the supporting\nfloor slab, which has implications for the location of services suspended from\nthe underside of the slab impacting energy efficiency, acoustic separation and\nfire resistance for the surrounding structural elements);\n• the use of the building and characteristics of the proposed building;\n• the use of novel materials, construction methods;\n• other unique or new design considerations; and\n• the characteristics of the proposed location of the project (i.e. bushfire hazard,\nstorm surge, or geology).\nThe process for development of the Performance Solution will not vary with project\ncomplexity.

Irrespective of controls about who can undertake\nthis process, the practitioners involved have a professional responsibility for ensuring\nthat appropriately skilled and experienced persons are engaged and participate as\nstakeholders in the process.\nPrior to commencing the process, consideration should be given to the extent of\nstakeholder consultation needed to produce a successful outcome. This is because\nthe Performance Requirements of the NCC address all aspects of design and\nconstruction, such as structural design, fire safety, access and egress, plumbing,\ndrainage, ventilation, lighting and energy efficiency. With an increasing number and\ncomplexity of Performance Solutions applicable in a building design, together with\nthe need to identify interrelationships between requirements of different parts of the\nNCC, it may not be feasible for an individual practitioner to understand whether a\nparticular solution complies with all relevant Performance Requirements.\nDepending on the required Performance Solution, it may be appropriate to engage a\nBCA/PCA consultant, to assist stakeholders to understand the compliance\nrequirements and opportunities for design output, including how issues might be\nresolved. The BCA/PCA consultant would complement the appropriate authority who\nis there to provide advice about compliance requirements for design approaches\ncontemplated rather than advice on how to solve compliance matters.\nIt is important that the integrity of the statutory role of the appropriate authority is not\ncompromised by design practitioners seeking solution advice, as this gives rise to a\nconflict of interest when undertaking the statutory assessment of the design solution.\nabcb.gov.au Page 8", "text_len": 2349, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}

They\ndo not, however, indicate the probability of that outcome being realised.\nDeterministic methods are the most commonly used as they are better developed,\nless complex and less demanding on data and analysis than a probabilistic method.\n3.3.2.2 Probabilistic approach\nThese methods generally assign reliabilities to the performance of the various fire\nprotection measures and assign frequencies of occurrence of events. They may\nanalyse and combine several different scenarios. This use of multiple scenarios and\ntheir combination through probabilistic techniques is a key feature of some of the\nmethods.\nProbabilistic methods generally require much statistical data which are not always\nreadily available and because of their complexity, may involve time-consuming\ncalculations.

The NCC provides a uniform set of technical provisions for\nthe design and construction of buildings and other structures, and plumbing and\ndrainage systems throughout Australia. It allows for variations in climate and\ngeological or geographic conditions.\nThe NCC is given legal effect by building and plumbing regulatory legislation in each\nstate and territory. This legislation consists of an Act of Parliament and subordinate\nlegislation (e.g. building regulations) which empowers the regulation of certain\naspects of buildings and structures, and contains the administrative provisions\nnecessary to give effect to the legislation.\nEach state's and territory's legislation adopts the NCC subject to the variation or\ndeletion of some of its provisions, or the addition of extra provisions. These\nvariations, deletions and additions are generally signposted within the relevant\nsection of the NCC, and located within appendices to the NCC. Notwithstanding this,\nany provision of the NCC may be overridden by, or subject to, state or territory\nlegislation. The NCC must therefore be read in conjunction with that legislation.\nA.2 Demonstrating compliance with the NCC\nCompliance with the NCC is achieved by complying with the Governing\nRequirements of the NCC and relevant Performance Requirements.\nThe Governing Requirements are a set of governing rules outlining how the NCC\nmust be used and the process that must be followed.\nabcb.gov.au Page 28", "text_len": 1934, "extraction_method": "pdfplumber", "fallback_attempted": false, "likely_image_or_scan": false}
