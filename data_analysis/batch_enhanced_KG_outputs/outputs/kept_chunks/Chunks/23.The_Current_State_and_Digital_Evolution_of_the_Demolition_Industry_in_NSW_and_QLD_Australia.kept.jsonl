In a\npilot case in Leuven, a building slated for partial demolition was used to test the\nAl's recommendations. The Al analyzed photographs and determined that certain\nfacade elements (brick and stone) could be salvaged if removed carefully rather\nthan demolished outright. It recommended a selective demolition approach, and\nthe project team followed this guidance - they hired specialist crews to gently\ndismantle facade sections for reuse. The result was that about 15% of the\nbuilding materials were directly re-used in a new building (Saving material costs\nand reducing waste). The Al wasn't perfect; it overestimated the reusability of\nsome components (some bricks were too damaged to reclaim despite appearing\nfine in photos). But overall, it improved the sustainability outcome. The challenge\nhere was convincing the contractor to alter their usual method (which might have\nbeen faster) to do more manual salvage work. Policy incentives (like avoided\nwaste fees and a modest subsidy for reuse) helped tip the balance. This case\nsignals a future where Al could drive demolition methods to be more circular,\naligning with environmental goals. It’s relevant to Australia as well - with\nincreasing waste levy costs and sustainability targets, similar Al might guide"}

One notable trend is the increasing emphasis on sustainability\nand waste reduction. Construction and demolition waste makes up a large share\nof Australia’s waste stream. Back in 2008-09, about 19 million tonnes of\nconstruction and demolition waste were generated nationwide, of which 55%\nwas recovered and recycled. In the best-performing states, over 75% of this\nwaste is now diverted from landfill. This push for recycling has created a market\nfor demolition contractors to salvage materials (metals, concrete, timber) and\ncollaborate with recycling facilities. Many demolition firms now offer “make safe\nand recycle” services as part of their projects, turning waste disposal into\nresource recovery. Another trend is the heightened focus on hazardous material\nremoval - especially asbestos, which is prevalent in older Australian buildings.\nStrict asbestos removal regulations mean demolition contractors must often\ncoordinate closely with licensed asbestos removalists, and in many cases obtain\nseparate asbestos removal licences. This has effectively expanded the scope of\nwhat demolition companies must manage on a job, integrating remediation tasks\ninto demolition workflows."}
